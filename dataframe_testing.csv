BIRDS ILLUSTRATED BY COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY [Illustration: NONPAREIL.] NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY OFFICE: FISHER BUILDING CHICAGO BIRDS ILLUSTRATED BY COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY A MONTHLY SERIAL DESIGNED TO PROMOTE KNOWLEDGE OF BIRD-LIFE ""With cheerful hop from perch to spray, They sport along the meads; In social bliss together stray, Where love or fancy leads. Through spring's gay scenes each happy pair Their fluttering joys pursue; Its various charms and produce share, Forever kind and true."" CHICAGO, U. S. A. NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY, PUBLISHERS 1896 PREFACE. It has become a universal custom to obtain and preserve the likenesses of one's friends. Photographs are the most popular form of these likenesses, as they give the true exterior outlines and appearance, (except coloring) of the subjects. But how much more popular and useful does photography become, when it can be used as a means of securing plates from which to print photographs in a regular printing press, and, what is more astonishing and delightful, to produce the REAL COLORS of nature as shown in the subject, no matter how brilliant or varied. We quote from the December number of the Ladies' Home Journal: ""_An excellent_ suggestion was recently made by the Department of Agriculture at Washington that the public schools of the country shall have a new holiday, to be known as Bird Day. Three cities have already adopted the suggestion, and it is likely that others will quickly follow. Of course, Bird Day will differ from its successful predecessor, Arbor Day. We can plant trees but not birds. It is suggested that Bird Day take the form of bird exhibitions, of bird exercises, of bird studies--any form of entertainment, in fact, which will bring children closer to their little brethren of the air, and in more intelligent sympathy with their life and ways. There is a wonderful story in bird life, and but few of our children know it. Few of our elders do, for that matter. A whole day of a year can well and profitably be given over to the birds. Than such study, nothing can be more interesting. The cultivation of an intimate acquaintanceship with our feathered friends is a source of genuine pleasure. We are under greater obligations to the birds than we dream of. Without them the world would be more barren than we imagine. Consequently, we have some duties which we owe them. What these duties are only a few of us know or have ever taken the trouble to find out. Our children should not be allowed to grow to maturity without this knowledge. The more they know of the birds the better men and women they will be. We can hardly encourage such studies too much."" Of all animated nature, birds are the most beautiful in coloring, most graceful in form and action, swiftest in motion and most perfect emblems of freedom. They are withal, very intelligent and have many remarkable traits, so that their habits and characteristics make a delightful study for all lovers of nature. In view of the facts, we feel that we are doing a useful work for the young, and one that will be appreciated by progressive parents, in placing within the easy possession of children in the homes these beautiful photographs of birds. The text is prepared with the view of giving the children as clear an idea as possible, of haunts, habits, characteristics and such other information as will lead them to love the birds and delight in their study and acquaintance.

Some call me the ""Painted Finch"" or ""Painted Bunting."" Others call me ""The Pope,"" because I wear a purple hood. I live in a cage, eat seeds, and am very fond of flies and spiders. Sometimes they let me out of the cage and I fly about the room and catch flies. I like to catch them while they are flying. When I am tired I stop and sing. There is a vase of flowers in front of the mirror. I fly to this vase where I can see myself in the glass. Then I sing as loud as I can. They like to hear me sing. I take a bath every day and how I do make the water fly! I used to live in the woods where there were many birds like me. We built our nests in bushes, hedges, and low trees. How happy we were. My cage is pretty but I wish I could go back to my home in the woods. See page 15. ""Sweet warblers of the sunny hours, Forever on the wing, I love thee as I love the flowers, The sunlight and the spring. They come like pleasant memories In summer's joyous time, And sing their gushing melodies, As I would sing a rhyme. In the green and quiet places, Where the golden sunlight falls, We sit with smiling faces To list their silver calls. And when their holy anthems Come pealing through the air, Our hearts leap forth to meet them With a blessing and a prayer. Amid the morning's fragrant dew, Amid the mists of even, They warble on as if they drew Their music down from heaven. How sweetly sounds each mellow note Beneath the moon's pale ray, When dying zephyrs rise and float Like lovers' sighs away!"" THE RESPLENDENT TROGON. A Letter to Little Boys and Girls of the United States. Is it cold where you live, little boys and girls? It is not where I live. Don't you think my feathers grew in the bright sunshine? My home is way down where the big oceans almost meet. The sun is almost straight overhead every noon. I live in the woods, way back where the trees are tall and thick. I don't fly around much, but sit on a limb of a tree way up high. Don't you think my red breast looks pretty among the green leaves? When I see a fly or a berry I dart down after it. My long tail streams out behind like four ribbons. I wish you could see me. My tail never gets in the way. Wouldn't you like to have me sit on your shoulder, little boy? You see my tail would reach almost to the ground. If you went out into the street with me on your shoulder, I would call _whe-oo_, _whe-oo_, the way I do in the woods. All the little boys and girls playing near would look around and say, ""What is that noise?"" Then they would see you and me and run up fast and say, ""Where did you get that bird?"" The little girls would want to pull out my tail feathers to put around their hats. You would not let them, would you? I have a mate. I think she is very nice. Her tail is not so long as mine. Would you like to see her too? She lays eggs every year, and sits on them till little birds hatch out. They are just like us, but they have to grow and get dressed in the pretty feathers like ours. They look like little dumplings when they come out of the eggs. But they are all right. They get very hungry and we carry them lots of things to eat, so they can grow fast. Your friend, R. T. [Illustration: RESPLENDENT TROGON.] THE RESPLENDENT TROGON. Resplendent Trogons are natives of Central America. There are fifty kinds, and this is the largest. A systematic account of the superb tribe has been given by Mr. Gould, the only naturalist who has made himself fully acquainted with them. Of all birds there are few which excite so much admiration as the Resplendent Trogon. The skin is so singularly thin that it has been not inaptly compared to wet blotting paper, and the plumage has so light a hold upon the skin that when the bird is shot the feathers are plentifully struck from their sockets by its fall and the blows which it receives from the branches as it comes to the ground. Its eggs, of a pale bluish-green, were first procured by Mr. Robert Owen. Its chief home is in the mountains near Coban in Vera Paz, but it also inhabits forests in other parts of Guatemala at an elevation of from 6,000 to 9,000 feet. From Mr. Salvin's account of his shooting in Vera Paz we extract the following hunting story: ""My companions are ahead and Filipe comes back to say that they have heard a quesal (Resplendent Trogon). Of course, being anxious to watch as well as to shoot one of these birds myself, I immediately hurry to the spot. I have not to wait long. A distant clattering noise indicates that the bird is on the wing. He settles--a splendid male--on the bough of a tree not seventy yards from where we are hidden. It sits almost motionless on its perch, the body remaining in the same position, the head only moving from side to side. The tail does not hang quite perpendicularly, the angle between the true tail and the vertical being perhaps as much as fifteen or twenty degrees. The tail is occasionally jerked open and closed again, and now and then slightly raised, causing the long tail coverts to vibrate gracefully. I have not seen all. A ripe fruit catches the quesal's eye and he darts from his perch, plucks the berry, and returns to his former position. This is done with a degree of elegance that defies description. A low whistle from Capriano calls the bird near, and a moment afterward it is in my hand--the first quesal I have seen and shot."" The above anecdote is very beautiful and graphic, but we read the last sentence with pain. We wish to go on record with this our first number as being unreconciled to the _ruthless_ killing of the birds. He who said, not a sparrow ""shall fall on the ground without your Father,"" did not intend such birds to be killed, but to beautify the earth. The cries of the quesal are various. They consist principally of a low note, _whe-oo_, _whe-oo_, which the bird repeats, whistling it softly at first, then gradually swelling it into a loud and not unmelodious cry. This is often succeeded by a long note, which begins low and after swelling dies away as it began. Other cries are harsh and discordant. The flight of the Trogon is rapid and straight. The long tail feathers, which never seem to be in the way, stream after him. The bird is never found except in forests of the loftiest trees, the lower branches of which, being high above the ground, seem to be its favorite resort. Its food consists principally of fruit, but occasionally a caterpillar is found in its stomach. THE MANDARIN DUCK. A Letter from China. Quack! Quack! I got in just in time. I came as fast as I could, as I was afraid of being whipped. You see I live in a boat with a great many other ducks. My master and his family live in the boat too. Isn't that a funny place to live in? We stay in all night. Waking up early in the morning, we cry Quack! Quack! until we wake the master. He gets up and opens the gate for us and out we tumble into the water. We are in such a hurry that we fall over each other. We swim about awhile and then we go to shore for breakfast. There are wet places near the shore where we find worms, grubs, and roots. When evening comes the master blows a whistle. Then we know it is time to come home. We start as soon as we hear it, and hurry, because the last duck in gets a whipping. It does not hurt much but we do not like it, so we all try to get home first. I have web feet, but I perch like other birds on the branches of the trees near the river. My feathers are beautiful in the sunlight. My wife always sits near me. Her dress is not like mine. It is brown and grey. From May to August I lose my bright feathers, then I put on a dress like my wife's. My master's family are Chinese, and they are very queer. They would not sell me for anything, as they would not like to have me leave China. Sometimes a pair of us are put in a gay cage and carried to a wedding. After the wedding we are given to the bride and groom. I hear the master's whistle again. He wants me to come in and go to bed. Quack! Quack! Good bye! [Illustration: MANDARIN DUCK.] THE MANDARIN DUCK. ""A more magnificently clothed bird,"" says Wood, ""than the male Chinese Mandarin Duck, can hardly be found, when in health and full nuptial plumage. They are natives of China and Japan, and are held in such high esteem by the Chinese that they can hardly be obtained at any price, the natives having a singular dislike to seeing the birds pass into the possession of Europeans."" Though web-footed, the birds have the power of perching and it is a curious sight to watch them on the branches of trees overhanging the pond in which they live, the male and female being always close together, the one gorgeous in purple, green, white, and chestnut, and the other soberly appareled in brown and grey. This handsome plumage the male loses during four months of the year, from May to August, when he throws off his fine crest, his wing-fans, and all his brilliant colors, assuming the sober tinted dress of his mate. The Summer Duck of America bears a close resemblance to the Mandarin Duck, both in plumage and manners, and at certain times of the year is hardly to be distinguished from that bird. The foreign duck has been successfully reared in Zoological Gardens, some being hatched under the parent bird and others under a domestic hen, the latter hatching the eggs three days in advance of the former. ""The Chinese,"" says Dr. Bennett, ""highly esteem the Mandarin Duck, which exhibits, as they think, a most striking example of conjugal attachment and fidelity. A pair of them are frequently placed in a gaily decorated cage and carried in their marriage processions, to be presented to the bride and groom as worthy objects of emulation."" ""I could more easily,"" wrote a friend of Dr. Bennett's in China to whom he had expressed his desire for a pair of these birds, ""send you two live Mandarins than a pair of Mandarin Ducks."" Concerning their attachment and fidelity to one another, Dr. Bennett recites the following: ""Mr. Beale's aviary at Maceo one day was broken open and the male bird stolen from the side of its mate. She refused to be comforted, and, retiring to the farthest part of the aviary, sat disconsolate, rarely partaking of food, and giving no attention to her soiled and rumpled plumage. In vain did another handsome drake endeavor to console her for her loss. After some time the stolen bird was found in the quarters of a miserable Chinaman, and at once restored to its mate. As soon as he recognized his abode he began to flap his wings and quack vehemently. She heard his voice and almost quacked to screaming with ecstasy, both expressing their joy by crossing necks and quacking in concert. The next morning he fell upon the unfortunate drake who had made consolatory advances to his mate, pecked out his eyes and so injured him that the poor fellow died in the course of a few days."" According to Schrenck, this species appears in the countries watered by the Amoor about May, and departs again at the end of August; at this season it is always met with in small or large flocks, which are so extremely shy that they rarely come within gunshot. Whilst on the wing these parties crowd closely together in front, the birds in the rear occupying a comparatively free space. THE GOLDEN PHEASANT They call me the Golden Pheasant, because I have a golden crest. It is like a king's crown. Don't you think my dress is beautiful enough for a king? See the large ruff around my neck. I can raise and lower it as I please. I am a very large bird. I am fourteen inches tall and twenty-eight inches long. I can step right over your little robins and meadow larks and blue jays and not touch them. Sometimes people get some of our eggs and put them under an old hen. By and by little pheasants hatch out, and the hen is very good to them. She watches over them and feeds them, but they do not wish to stay with her; they like their wild life. If they are not well fed they will fly away. I have a wife. Her feathers are beginning to grow like mine. In a few years she will look as I do. We like to have our nests by a fallen tree. * * * The well-known Chinese Pheasant, which we have named the Golden Pheasant, as well as its more sober-colored cousin, the Silver Pheasant, has its home in Eastern Asia. China is pre-eminently the land of Pheasants; for, besides those just mentioned, several other species of the same family are found there. Japan comes next to China as a pheasant country and there are some in India. In China the Golden Pheasant is a great favorite, not only for its splendid plumage and elegant form, but for the excellence of its flesh, which is said to surpass even that of the common pheasant. It has been introduced into Europe, but is fitted only for the aviary. For purposes of the table it is not likely to come into general use, as there are great difficulties in the way of breeding it in sufficient numbers, and one feels a natural repugnance to the killing of so beautiful a bird for the sake of eating it. The magnificent colors belong only to the male, the female being reddish brown, spotted and marked with a darker hue. The tail of the female is short. The statement is made, however, that some hens kept for six years by Lady Essex gradually assumed an attire like that of the males. Fly-fishers highly esteem the crest and feathers on the back of the neck of the male, as many of the artificial baits owe their chief beauty to the Golden Pheasant. According to Latham, it is called by the Chinese Keuki, or Keukee, a word which means gold flower fowl. * * * ""A merry welcome to thee, glittering bird! Lover of summer flowers and sunny things! A night hath passed since my young buds have heard The music of thy rainbow-colored wings-- Wings that flash spangles out where'er they quiver, Like sunlight rushing o'er a river."" [Illustration: GOLDEN PHEASANT.] THE NONPAREIL. So full of fight is this little bird, that the bird trappers take advantage of his disposition to make him a prisoner. They place a decoy bird on a cage trap in the attitude of defense, and when it is discovered by the bird an attack at once follows, and the fighter soon finds himself caught. They are a great favorite for the cage, being preferred by many to the Canary. Whatever he may lack as a songster he more than makes up by his wonderful beauty. These birds are very easily tamed, the female, even in the wild state, being so gentle that she allows herself to be lifted from the nest. They are also called the _Painted Finch_ or _Painted Bunting_. They are found in our Southern States and Mexico. They are very numerous in the State of Louisiana and especially about the City of New Orleans, where they are greatly admired by the French inhabitants, who, true to their native instincts, admire anything with gay colors. As the first name indicates, he has no equal, perhaps, among the songsters for beauty of dress. On account of this purple hood, he is called by the French _Le Pape_, meaning The Pope. The bird makes its appearance in the Southern States the last of April and, during the breeding season, which lasts until July, two broods are raised. The nests are made of fine grass and rest in the crotches of twigs of the low bushes and hedges. The eggs have a dull or pearly-white ground and are marked with blotches and dots of purplish and reddish brown. It is very pleasing to watch the numerous changes which the feathers undergo before the male bird attains his full beauty of color. The young birds of both sexes during the first season are of a fine olive green color on the upper parts and a pale yellow below. The female undergoes no material change in color except becoming darker as she grows older. The male, on the contrary, is three seasons in obtaining his full variety of colors. In the second season the blue begins to show on his head and the red also makes its appearance in spots on the breast. The third year he attains his full beauty. Their favorite resorts are small thickets of low trees and bushes, and when singing they select the highest branches of the bush. They are passionately fond of flies and insects and also eat seeds and rice. Thousands of these birds are trapped for the cage, and sold annually to our northern people and also in Europe. They are comparatively cheap, even in our northern bird markets, as most of them are exchanged for our Canaries and imported birds that cannot be sent directly to the south on account of climatic conditions. Many a northern lady, while visiting the orange groves of Florida, becomes enchanted with the Nonpareil in his wild state, and some shrewd and wily negro, hearing her expressions of delight, easily procures one, and disposes of it to her at an extravagant price. THE AUSTRALIAN GRASS PARRAKEET. I am a Parrakeet. I belong to the Parrot family. A man bought me and brought me here. It is not warm here, as it was where I came from. I almost froze coming over here. I am not kept in a cage. I stay in the house and go about as I please. There is a Pussy Cat in the house. Sometimes I ride on her back. I like that. I used to live in the grass lands. It was very warm there. I ran among the thick grass blades, and sat on the stems and ate seeds. I had a wife then. Her feathers were almost like mine. We never made nests. When we wanted a nest, we found a hole in a gum tree. I used to sing to my wife while she sat on the nest. I can mock other birds. Sometimes I warble and chirp at the same time. Then it sounds like two birds singing. My tongue is short and thick, and this helps me to talk. But I have been talking too much. My tongue is getting tired. I think I'll have a ride on Pussy's back. Good bye. * * * Parrakeets have a great fondness for the grass lands, where they may be seen in great numbers, running amid the thick grass blades, clinging to their stems, or feeding on their seeds. Grass seed is their constant food in their native country. In captivity they take well to canary seed, and what is remarkable, never pick food with their feet, as do other species of parrots, but always use their beaks. ""They do not build a nest, but must be given a piece of wood with a rough hole in the middle, which they will fill to their liking, rejecting all soft lining of wool or cotton that you may furnish them."" Only the male sings, warbling nearly all day long, pushing his beak at times into his mate's ear as though to give her the full benefit of his song. The lady, however, does not seem to appreciate his efforts, but generally pecks him sharply in return. A gentleman who brought a Parrakeet from Australia to England, says it suffered greatly from the cold and change of climate and was kept alive by a kind-hearted weather-beaten sailor, who kept it warm and comfortable in his bosom. It was not kept in a cage, but roamed at will about the room, enjoying greatly at times, a ride on the cat's back. At meals he perched upon his master's shoulder, picking the bits he liked from a plate set before him. If the weather was cold or chilly, he would pull himself up by his master's whiskers and warm his feet by standing on his bald head. He always announced his master's coming by a shrill call, and no matter what the hour of night, never failed to utter a note of welcome, although apparently asleep with his head tucked under his wing. [Illustration: AUSTRALIAN GRASS PARRAKEET.] [Illustration: COCK-OF-THE-ROCK.] THE COCK-OF-THE-ROCK. The Cock-of-the-Rock lives in Guiana. Its nest is found among the rocks. T. K. Salmon says: ""I once went to see the breeding place of the Cock-of-the-Rock; and a darker or wilder place I have never been in. Following up a mountain stream the gorge became gradually more enclosed and more rocky, till I arrived at the mouth of a cave with high rock on each side, and overshadowed by high trees, into which the sun never penetrated. All was wet and dark, and the only sound heard was the rushing of the water over the rocks. We had hardly become accustomed to the gloom when a nest was found, a dark bird stealing away from what seemed to be a lump of mud upon the face of the rock. This was a nest of the Cock-of-the-Rock, containing two eggs; it was built upon a projecting piece, the body being made of mud or clay, then a few sticks, and on the top lined with green moss. It was about five feet from the water. I did not see the male bird, and, indeed, I have rarely ever seen the male and female birds together, though I have seen both sexes in separate flocks."" The eggs are described as pale buff with various sized spots of shades from red-brown to pale lilac. It is a solitary and wary bird, feeding before sunrise and after sunset and hiding through the day in sombre ravines. Robert Schomburgh describes its dance as follows: ""While traversing the mountains of Western Guiana we fell in with a pack of these splendid birds, which gave me the opportunity of being an eye witness of their dancing, an accomplishment which I had hitherto regarded as a fable. We cautiously approached their ballet ground and place of meeting, which lay some little distance from the road. The stage, if we may so call it, measured from four to five feet in diameter; every blade of grass had been removed and the ground was as smooth as if leveled by human hands. On this space we saw one of the birds dance and jump about, while the others evidently played the part of admiring spectators. At one moment it expanded its wings, threw its head in the air, or spread out its tail like a peacock scratching the ground with its foot; all this took place with a sort of hopping gait, until tired, when on emitting a peculiar note, its place was immediately filled by another performer. In this manner the different birds went through their terpsichorean exercises, each retiring to its place among the spectators, who had settled on the low bushes near the theatre of operations. We counted ten males and two females in the flock. The noise of a breaking stick unfortunately raised an alarm, when the whole company of dancers immediately flew off."" ""The Indians, who place great value on their skins, eagerly seek out their playing grounds, and armed with their blow-tubes and poisoned arrows, lie in wait for the dances. The hunter does not attempt to use his weapon until the company is quite engrossed in the performance, when the birds become so preoccupied with their amusement that four or five are often killed before the survivors detect the danger and decamp."" THE RED BIRD OF PARADISE. My home is on an island where it is very warm. I fly among the tall trees and eat fruit and insects. See my beautiful feathers. The ladies like to wear them in their hats. The feathers of my wife are brown, but she has no long tail feathers. My wife thinks my plumes are very beautiful. When we have a party, we go with our wives to a tall tree. We spread our beautiful plumes while our wives sit and watch us. Sometimes a man finds our tree and builds a hut among the lower branches. He hides in the hut and while we are spreading our feathers shoots at us. The arrows are not sharp. They do not draw blood. When they dry the skins they take off the feet and wings. This is why people used to think we had neither feet nor wings. They also thought we lived on the dews of heaven and the honey of flowers. This is why we are called the Birds of Paradise. * * * ""Upon its waving feathers poised in air, Feathers, or rather clouds of golden down, With streamers thrown luxuriantly out In all the wantonness of winged wealth."" [Illustration: RED BIRD OF PARADISE.] THE RED BIRD OF PARADISE. Birds of Paradise are found only in New Guinea and on the neighboring islands. The species presented here is found only on a few islands. In former days very singular ideas prevailed concerning these birds and the most extravagant tales were told of the life they led in their native lands. The natives of New Guinea, in preparing their skins for exportation, had removed all traces of legs, so that it was popularly supposed they possessed none, and on account of their want of feet and their great beauty, were called the Birds of Paradise, retaining, it was thought, the forms they had borne in the Garden of Eden, living upon dew or ether, through which it was imagined they perpetually floated by the aid of their long cloud-like plumage. Of one in confinement Dr. Bennett says: ""I observed the bird, before eating a grasshopper, place the insect upon the perch, keep it firmly fixed by the claws, and, divesting it of the legs, wings, etc., devour it with the head always first. It rarely alights upon the ground, and so proud is the creature of its elegant dress that it never permits a soil to remain upon it, frequently spreading out its wings and feathers, regarding its splendid self in every direction."" The sounds uttered by this bird are very peculiar, resembling somewhat the cawing of the Raven, but change gradually to a varied scale in musical gradations, like _he, hi, ho, how_! He frequently raises his voice, sending forth notes of such power as to be heard at a long distance. These notes are _whack_, _whack_, uttered in a barking tone, the last being a low note in conclusion. While creeping amongst the branches in search of insects, he utters a soft clucking note. During the entire day he flies incessantly from one tree to another, perching but a few moments, and concealing himself among the foliage at the least suspicion of danger. In Bennett's ""Wanderings"" is an entertaining description of Mr. Beale's bird at Maceo. ""This elegant bird,"" he says, ""has a light, playful, and graceful manner, with an arch and impudent look, dances about when a visitor approaches the cage, and seems delighted at being made an object of admiration. It bathes twice daily, and after performing its ablutions throws its delicate feathers up nearly over its head, the quills of which have a peculiar structure, enabling the bird to effect this object. To watch this bird make its toilet is one of the most interesting sights of nature; the vanity which inspires its every movement, the rapturous delight with which it views its enchanting self, its arch look when demanding the spectator's admiration, are all pardonable in a delicate creature so richly embellished, so neat and cleanly, so fastidious in its tastes, so scrupulously exact in its observances, and so winning in all its ways."" Says a traveler in New Guinea: ""As we were drawing near a small grove of teak-trees, our eyes were dazzled with a sight more beautiful than any I had yet beheld. It was that of a Bird of Paradise moving through the bright light of the morning sun. I now saw that the birds must be seen alive in their native forests, in order to fully comprehend the poetic beauty of the words Birds of Paradise. They seem the inhabitants of a fairer world than ours, things that have wandered in some way from their home, and found the earth to show us something of the beauty of worlds beyond."" THE YELLOW THROATED TOUCAN. I am a Toucan and I live in a very warm country. See my handsome black coat and my yellow vest. My toes are like a parrot's, two in front and two behind. They help me to hold to the limbs. Look at my large beak. It looks heavy but it is not, as it is filled with air cells. These make it very light. Do you like my blue eyes? My nest is very hard to find. If I tell you where it is, you will not take the eggs, will you? It is in a hollow limb of a very high tree. I am very fond of fruit, and for this reason the people on the plantations do not like me very well. I can fly very fast, but I cannot get along so well on the ground. I keep my feet far apart and hop. I like to sit in the top of the tallest trees. Then I am not afraid. Nothing can reach me there but a rifle ball. I do not like the owl, he is so ugly. When we find an owl we get in a circle around him and snap our great beaks, and jerk our tails up and down and scream. He is very much afraid of us. The people where I live like our yellow breasts. They wear them on their heads, and also put them on the ends of their bows. We sometimes sit together in a tree and snap our beaks and shout. This is why we have been called ""Preacher Birds."" We can scream so loud that we may be heard a mile away. Our song is ""Tucano! Tucano!"" I think it is a pretty song, but the people do not like it very much. [Illustration: YELLOW THROATED TOUCAN.] THE YELLOW THROATED TOUCAN. The Toucans are a numerous race of South American birds, at once recognizable by the prodigious size of their beaks and by the richness of their plumage. ""These birds are very common,"" says Prince Von Wied, ""in all parts of the extensive forests of the Brazils and are killed for the table in large numbers during the cool seasons. Their eggs are deposited in the hollow limbs and holes of the colossal trees, so common in the tropical forests, but their nests are very difficult to find. The egg is said to be white. They are very fond of fruit, oranges, guavas and plantains, and when these fruits are ripe make sad havoc among the neighboring plantations. In return for these depredations the planter eats their flesh, which is very delicate."" The flight of these birds is easy and graceful, sweeping with facility over the loftiest trees of their native forests, their strangely developed bills being no encumbrance to them, replete as they are with a tissue of air-filled cells rendering them very light and even buoyant. On the ground they get along with a rather awkward hopping movement, their legs being kept widely apart. In ascending a tree they do not climb but mount from one branch to another with a series of jumps, ascending to the tops of the very loftiest trees, safe from every missile except a rifle ball. They have a habit of sitting on the branches in flocks, lifting their bills, clattering them together, and shouting hoarsely all the while, from which custom the natives call them Preacher-birds. Sometimes the whole party, including the sentinel, set up a simultaneous yell so deafeningly loud that it can be heard a mile. They are very loquacious birds and are often discovered through their perpetual chattering. Their cry resembles the word ""Tucano,"" which has given origin to the peculiar name. When settling itself to sleep, the Toucan packs itself up in a very systematic manner, supporting its huge beak by resting it on its back, and tucking it completely among the feathers, while it doubles its tail across its back just as if it moved on hinges. So completely is the large bill hidden among the feathers, that hardly a trace of it is visible in spite of its great size and bright color, so that the bird when sleeping looks like a great ball of loose feathers. Sir R. Owen concludes that the large beak is of service in masticating food compensating for the absence of any grinding structures in the intestinal tract. Says a naturalist: ""We turned into a gloomy forest and for some time saw nothing but a huge brown moth, which looked almost like a bat on the wing. Suddenly we heard high upon the trees a short shrieking sort of noise ending in a hiss, and our guide became excited and said, ""Toucan!"" The birds were very wary and made off. They are much in quest and often shot at. At last we caught sight of a pair, but they were at the top of such a high tree that they were out of range. Presently, when I had about lost hope, I heard loud calls, and three birds came and settled in a low bush in the middle of the path. I shot one and it proved to be a very large toucan. The bird was not quite dead when I picked it up, and it bit me severely with its huge bill."" THE RED-RUMPED TANAGER. I have just been singing my morning song, and I wish you could have heard it. I think you would have liked it. I always sing very early in the morning. I sing because I am happy, and the people like to hear me. My home is near a small stream, where there are low woods and underbrush along its banks. There is an old dead tree there, and just before the sun is up I fly to this tree. I sit on one of the branches and sing for about half an hour. Then I fly away to get my breakfast. I am very fond of fruit. Bananas grow where I live, and I like them best of all. I eat insects, and sometimes I fly to the rice fields and swing on the stalks and eat rice. The people say I do much harm to the rice, but I do not see why it is wrong for me to eat it, for I think there is enough for all. I must go now and get my breakfast. If you ever come to see me I will sing to you. I will show you my wife, too. She looks just like me. Be sure to get up very early. If you do not, you will be too late for my song. * * * ""Birds, Birds! ye are beautiful things, With your earth-treading feet and your cloud-cleaving wings. Where shall man wander, and where shall he dwell-- Beautiful birds--that ye come not as well? Ye have nests on the mountain, all rugged and stark, Ye have nests in the forest, all tangled and dark; Ye build and ye brood 'neath the cottagers' eaves, And ye sleep on the sod, 'mid the bonnie green leaves; Ye hide in the heather, ye lurk in the brake, Ye dine in the sweet flags that shadow the lake; Ye skim where the stream parts the orchard decked land, Ye dance where the foam sweeps the desolate strand."" [Illustration: RED-RUMPED TANAGER.] THE RED-RUMPED TANAGER. An American family, the Tanagers are mostly birds of very brilliant plumage. There are 300 species, a few being tropical birds. They are found in British and French Guiana, living in the latter country in open spots of dwellings and feeding on bananas and other fruits. They are also said to do much harm in the rice fields. In ""The Auk,"" of July, 1893, Mr. George K. Cherrie, of the Field Museum, says of the Red-Rumped Tanager: ""During my stay at Boruca and Palmar, (the last of February) the breeding season was at its height, and I observed many of the Costa Rica Red-Rumps nesting. In almost every instance where possible I collected both parents of the nests, and in the majority of cases found the males wearing the same dress as the females. In a few instances the male was in mottled plumage, evidently just assuming the adult phase, and in a lesser number of examples the male was in fully adult plumage--velvety black and crimson red. From the above it is clear that the males begin to breed before they attain fully adult plumage, and that they retain the dress of the female until, at least, the beginning of the second year. ""While on this trip I had many proofs that, in spite of its rich plumage, and being a bird of the tropics, it is well worthy to hold a place of honor among the song birds. And if the bird chooses an early hour and a secluded spot for expressing its happiness, the melody is none the less delightful. At the little village of Buenos Aires, on the Rio Grande of Terraba, I heard the song more frequently than at any other point. Close by the ranch house at which we were staying, there is a small stream bordered by low woods and underbrush, that formed a favorite resort for the birds. Just below the ranch is a convenient spot where we took our morning bath. I was always there just as the day was breaking. On the opposite bank was a small open space in the brush occupied by the limbs of a dead tree. On one of these branches, and always the same one, was the spot chosen by a Red-rump to pour forth his morning song. Some mornings I found him busy with his music when I arrived, and again he would be a few minutes behind me. Sometimes he would come from one direction, sometimes from another, but he always alighted at the same spot and then lost no time in commencing his song. While singing, the body was swayed to and fro, much after the manner of a canary while singing. The song would last for perhaps half an hour, and then away the singer would go. I have not enough musical ability to describe the song, but will say that often I remained standing quietly for a long time, only that I might listen to the music."" THE GOLDEN ORIOLE. We find the Golden Oriole in America only. According to Mr. Nuttall, it is migratory, appearing in considerable numbers in West Florida about the middle of March. It is a good songster, and in a state of captivity imitates various tunes. This beautiful bird feeds on fruits and insects, and its nest is constructed of blades of grass, wool, hair, fine strings, and various vegetable fibers, which are so curiously interwoven as to confine and sustain each other. The nest is usually suspended from a forked and slender branch, in shape like a deep basin and generally lined with fine feathers. ""On arriving at their breeding locality they appear full of life and activity, darting incessantly through the lofty branches of the tallest trees, appearing and vanishing restlessly, flashing at intervals into sight from amidst the tender waving foliage, and seem like living gems intended to decorate the verdant garments of the fresh clad forest."" It is said these birds are so attached to their young that the female has been taken and conveyed on her eggs, upon which with resolute and fatal instinct she remained faithfully sitting until she expired. An Indiana gentleman relates the following story: ""When I was a boy living in the hilly country of Southern Indiana, I remember very vividly the nesting of a pair of fine Orioles. There stood in the barn yard a large and tall sugar tree with limbs within six or eight feet of the ground. ""At about thirty feet above the ground I discovered evidences of an Oriole's nest. A few days later I noticed they had done considerably more work, and that they were using horse hair, wool and fine strings. This second visit seemed to create consternation in the minds of the birds, who made a great deal of noise, apparently trying to frighten me away. I went to the barn and got a bunch of horse hair and some wool, and hung it on limbs near the nest. Then climbing up higher, I concealed myself where I could watch the work. In less than five minutes they were using the materials and chatted with evident pleasure over the abundant supply at hand. ""They appeared to have some knowledge of spinning, as they would take a horse hair and seemingly wrap it with wool before placing it in position on the nest. ""I visited these birds almost daily, and shortly after the nest was completed I noticed five little speckled eggs in it. The female was so attached to the nest that I often rubbed her on the back and even lifted her to look at the eggs."" [Illustration: GOLDEN ORIOLE.] TESTIMONIALS. CHICAGO, December 10th, 1896.

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

In our teaching of plastic anatomy, especially at the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts--where, for the past nine years, we have had the very great honour of supplementing the teaching of our distinguished master, Mathias Duval, after having been prosector for his course of lectures since 1881--it is our practice to give, as a complement to the study of human anatomy, a certain number of lessons on the anatomy of those animals which artists might be called on to represent. Now, we were given to understand that the subject treated in our lectures interested our hearers, so much so that we were not surprised to learn that a certain number repeatedly expressed a desire to see these lectures united in book form. To us this idea was not new; for many years the work in question had been in course of preparation, and we had collected materials for it, with the object of filling up a void of which the existence was to be regretted. But our many engagements prevented us from executing our project as early as we would have wished. It is this work which we publish to-day. [Illustration: FIG. I.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH BY BARYE (COLLECTIONS OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ÃCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).] Putting aside for a moment the wish expressed by our hearers, we feel ourselves in duty bound to inquire whether the utility of this publication is self-evident. Let it be clearly understood that we wish to express here our opinion on this subject, while putting aside every personal sentiment of an author. No one now disputes the value of anatomical studies made in view of carrying out the artistic representation of man. Nevertheless--for we must provide against all contingencies--the conviction on this subject may be more or less absolute; and yet it must possess this character in an intense degree in order that these studies may be profitable, and permit the attainment of the goal which is proposed in undertaking them. It is in this way that we ever strive to train the students whose studies we direct; not only to admit the value of these studies, but to be materially and deeply convinced of the fact without any restriction. Such is the sentiment which we endeavour to create and vigorously encourage. And we may be permitted to add that we have often been successful in this direction. Therefore it is that, at the beginning of our lectures, and in anticipation of possible objections, we are accustomed to take up the question of the utility of plastic anatomy. And in so doing, it is in order to combat at the outset the idea--as mischievous as it is false--which is sometimes imprudently enunciated, that the possession of scientific knowledge is likely to tarnish the purity and freshness of the impressions received by the artist, and to place shackles on the emotional sincerity of their representation. [Illustration: FIG. II.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH OF BARYE (COLLECTIONS OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ÃCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).] It is chiefly by employment of examples that we approach the subject. These strike the imagination of the student more forcibly, and the presentation of models of a certain choice, although rough in execution, is, in our opinion, preferable to considerations of an order possibly more exalted, but of a character less clearly practical. Let us, then, ask the question: Those artists whose eminence nobody would dare to question, did they study anatomy? If the answer be in the affirmative, we surely cannot permit ourselves to believe that we can dispense with a similar course. And, as proof of the studies of this class which the masters have made, we may cite Raphael, Michelangelo, and, above all, Leonardo da Vinci; and, of the moderns, GÃ©ricault. And we may more clearly define these proofs by an examination of the reproductions of their anatomical works, chosen from certain of their special writings.[1] [1] Mathias Duval and A.

Accordingly, there is no scope for serious discussion, and it only remains for us to enunciate the opinion that it is necessary that we should imitate those masters, and, with a sense of respectful discipline, follow their example. Here, with regard to the anatomy of animals, we pursue the same method, and the example chosen shall be that of Barye. His talent is too far above all criticism to allow that this example should be refused. The admiration which the works of this great artist elicit is too wide-spread for us to remain uninfluenced by the lessons furnished by his studies. It is sufficient to see the sketches relating to these studies, and his admirable casts from nature which form part of the anatomical museum of the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, to be convinced that the artistic temperament, of which Barye was one of the most brilliant examples, has nothing to lose by its association with researches the precision of which might seem likely to check its complete expansion. [Illustration: FIG. III.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH OF BARYE (COLLECTIONS OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ÃCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).] In those sketches we find proofs of observation so scrupulous that we cannot restrain our admiration for the man whose ardent imagination was voluntarily subjected to the toil of study so profound. If the example of Barye, with whom we associate the names of other great modern painters of animals, can determine the conviction which we seek to produce, we shall be sincerely glad. To contribute to the propagation of useful ideas, and to see them accepted, gives a feeling of satisfaction far too legitimate for us to hesitate to say what we should feel if our hope be realized in this instance.

THE LEAP 305 THE ARTISTIC ANATOMY OF ANIMALS INTRODUCTION GENERALITIES OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY Of the animals by which we are surrounded, there are some which, occupying a place in our lives by reason of their natural endowments, are frequently represented in the works of artists--either as accompanying man in his work or in his amusements, or as intended to occupy the whole interest of the composition. The necessity of knowing, from an artistic point of view, the structure of the human body makes clear the importance we attach, from the same point of view, to the study of the anatomy of animals--that is, the study of comparative anatomy. The name employed to designate this branch of anatomy shows that the object of this science is the study of the relative position and form which each region presents in all organized beings, taking for comparison the corresponding regions in man. The head in animals compared with the human head; the trunk and limbs compared to the trunk and limbs of the human being--this is the analysis we undertake, and the plan of the subject we are about to commence. Our intention being, as we have just said, the comparison of the structure of animals with that of man, should we describe the anatomy of the human being in the pages which follow? We do not think so. Plastic human anatomy having been previously studied in special works,[2] we take it for granted that these have been studied before undertaking the subject of comparative anatomy. We will therefore not occupy time with the elementary facts relative to the skeleton and the superficial layer of muscles. We will not dilate on the division of the bones into long, short, large, single, paired, etc. All these preliminary elements we shall suppose to have been already studied. [2] Mathias Duval, 'PrÃ©cis of Anatomy for the Use of Artists': Paris, 1881. 'Artistic Anatomy of the Human Body,' third edition, plates by Dr. Fau, text with figures by Ãdouard Cuyer: Paris, 1896. 'Artistic Anatomy of Man,' by J. C. L. Sparkes, second edition, text with 50 plates: BailliÃ¨re, Tindall and Cox, London, 1900. This being granted, it is, nevertheless, necessary to take a rapid bird's-eye view of organized beings, and to recall the terms used in their classification. Animals are primarily classed in great divisions, based on the general characters which differentiate them most. These divisions, or _branches_, allow of their being so grouped that in each of them we find united the individuals whose general structure is uniform; and under the name of vertebrates are included man and the animals with which our studies will be occupied. The vertebrates, as the name indicates, are recognised by the presence of an interior skeleton formed by a central axis, the vertebral column, round which the other parts of the skeleton are arranged. The vertebrate branch is divided into classes: fishes, amphibians or batrachians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The mammals--from the Latin _mamma_, a breast--are characterized by the presence of breasts designed for the alimentation of their young. Their bodies are covered with hair, hence the name _pilifÃ¨res_ proposed by Blainville; and, notwithstanding that in some individuals the hairs are few, the character is sufficient to distinguish them from all other vertebrates. We find united in this class animals which, at first, seem out of place, such as the whale and the bat; and, from their external appearance alone, the former would appear to belong to the fishes, and the latter to birds. Yet, on studying their structure, we find that, not only do these animals merit a place in the class which they occupy, because they possess the distinctive characters of mammals; but, still further, their internal structure is analogous to that of man and of the other individuals of this class. Notwithstanding this similarity of structure, the whale is not without some points of difference from its neighbours the horse and the dog; therefore, in order to place each of these animals in a position suitable to it, mammals are divided into secondary groups called _orders_. The first of these orders includes, under the name _primates_, man and apes. The latter contain animals which approach birds in certain characters of their organism, forming a link between the latter and mammals. We find, in studying the regions of the body in some of the vertebrates, that, while they present differences from the corresponding regions of the human body, they also offer most striking analogies. We can, for example, recognise the upper limb of man in the anterior one of quadrupeds, in the wing of the bat, in the paddle of the seal, etc. It is, so to speak, those variations of a great plan which give such a charm to the study of comparative anatomy. The division of classes into orders, which we have just mentioned, being still too general, it was found necessary to establish subdivisions--more and more specialized--to which the names _families_, _genera_, _species_, and _varieties_ were given. CHAPTER I OSTEOLOGY AND ARTHROLOGY THE TRUNK The Vertebral Column We commence the study of the skeleton with a description of the trunk. The trunk being, in quadrupeds, horizontal in direction (Fig. 1), the two regions of which it consists occupy, for this reason, the following positions: the thorax occupies the anterior part, the abdomen is placed behind it; the vertebral column is horizontal, and is situated at the superior aspect of the trunk; it projects beyond the latter: anteriorly, to articulate with the skull; and, posteriorly, to form the skeleton of the tail, or caudal appendix. The number of the vertebrÃ¦ is not the same in all mammalia. Of the several regions of the vertebral column, the cervical shows the greatest uniformity in the number of the vertebrÃ¦ of which it consists, with but two exceptions (eight or nine in the three-toed sloth, and six in the manatee); we always find seven cervical vertebrÃ¦, whatever the length of the neck of the animal. There are no more than seven vertebrÃ¦ in the long neck of the giraffe, but they are very long ones; and not less than seven in the very short neck of the dolphin, in which they are reduced to mere plates of bone not thicker than sheets of cardboard. If the cervical region presents uniformity in the number of its bones, it is not so with the other regions of the column. The following table shows their classification in some animals: VERTEBRÃ. +------------+-----------+---------+---------+ | | Cervical. | Dorsal. | Lumbar. | +------------+-----------+---------+---------+ | Bear | 7 | 14 | 6 | | Dog | 7 | 13 | 7 | | Cat | 7 | 13 | 7 | | Rabbit | 7 | 12 | 7 | | Pig | 7 | 14 | 6 or 7 | | Horse | 7 | 18 | 6 or 5 | | Ass | 7 | 18 | 5 | | Camel | 7 | 12 | 7 | | Giraffe | 7 | 14 | 5 | | Ox | 7 | 13 | 6 | | Sheep | 7 | 13 | 6 | +------------+-----------+---------+---------+ [Illustration: FIG. 1.--A HUMAN SKELETON IN THE ATTITUDE OF A QUADRUPED. TO GIVE A GENERAL IDEA OF THE POSITION OF THE BONES IN OTHER VERTEBRATES.] It is worthy of notice that in birds the number of the cervical vertebrÃ¦ is not constant, as in mammals; they are more numerous than the dorsal. These latter are almost always joined to one another by a fusion of their spinous processes; the two or three last vertebrÃ¦ are similarly united to the iliac bones, between which they are fixed. The dorsal vertebrÃ¦ thus form one piece, which gives solidity to the trunk, and provides a base of support to the wings, for the movements of flying. There are, so to speak, no lumbar vertebrÃ¦, the bones of that region, which cannot be differentiated from the sacrum, having coalesced with the bones of the pelvis. VERTEBRÃ. +------------------+-----------+---------+ | | Cervical. | Dorsal. | +------------------+-----------+---------+ | Vulture | 15 | 7 | | Eagle | 13 | 9 | | Cock | 14 | 7 | | Ostrich | 18 | 9 | | Swan | 23 | 10 | | Goose | 18 | 9 | | Duck | 15 | 9 | +------------------+-----------+---------+ In reptiles, the relation between the number of the cervical vertebrÃ¦ and that of the dorsal is very variable; some serpents are devoid of cervical vertebrÃ¦, having only dorsal ones--that is, vertebrÃ¦ carrying well-developed ribs. VERTEBRÃ. +-------------------+-----------+---------+---------+ | | Cervical. | Dorsal. | Lumbar. | +-------------------+-----------+---------+---------+ | Crocodile | 7 | 14 | 3 | | Caiman | 7 | 12 | 5 | | Boa | 3 | 248 | 0 | | Python | 0 | 320 | 0 | | Viper | 2 | 145 | 0 | +-------------------+-----------+---------+---------+ Regarding the direction of the vertebral column in animals, in which the trunk is not vertical, it is evident that the spinous processes point upward, and that in comparing them with those of man they must be arranged so that the superior surface of the human vertebra will correspond to the anterior surface of that of the quadruped. Of the cervical vertebrÃ¦, the atlas and axis call for special notice. Apropos of the atlas, we find that it, in the human being, is narrower than the corresponding parts of the skull, and is therefore hidden under the base of the cranium (Fig. 2); in quadrupeds its width is equal to that of the skull, and sometimes exceeds, because of the great development of its wing-shaped transverse processes, that of the neighbouring parts of the head (Fig. 3). On this account those transverse processes often project under the skin of the lateral surfaces of the upper part of the neck. [Illustration: FIG. 2.--SIZE OF THE ATLAS COMPARED WITH THE TRANSVERSE DIMENSIONS OF THE CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE SKULL IN MAN. 1, Atlas; 2, mastoid process; 3, external occipital protuberance; 4, inferior maxilla.] The axis is furnished on its anterior surface with the odontoid process, which articulates with the anterior (or inferior) arch of the atlas, according to the direction of the neck. The spinous process, flattened from without inwards, is more or less pointed; it is elongated from before backwards, so as partly to overlap the atlas and the third cervical vertebra. We find that this process overlaps less and less the neighbouring vertebrÃ¦ when we examine in succession the bear, the cat, the dog, the ox, and the horse. With regard to the other vertebrÃ¦ of this region, they diminish in width from the second to the seventh; and, in some animals, the anterior surface of the body presents a tubercle which articulates with a cavity hollowed in the posterior surface of that of the vertebra before it; this feature dwindles away in the dorsal and lumbar regions. The spinous process, slightly developed in the third cervical vertebra, gradually increases in size to the seventh, the spinous process of which, long and pointed, well deserves the name of _the prominent_ which is bestowed on it; but it should not be forgotten that the spinous process of the axis is equally developed. [Illustration: FIG. 3.--SIZE OF THE ATLAS COMPARED WITH THE TRANSVERSE DIMENSIONS OF THE CORRESPONDING REGIONS OF THE SKULL IN A DOG. 1, Atlas; 2, zygomatic arch; 3, external occipital protuberance; 4, inferior maxilla.] On the inferior surface of the body of each of the vertebrÃ¦ is found a prominent crest, especially well marked at the posterior part; this crest is but slightly developed in the bear and in the cat tribe, and is not found in swine. The transverse processes of the cervical vertebrÃ¦, from their relation to the trachea, are known as the _tracheal processes_. The most marked characteristic of the dorsal vertebrÃ¦ is furnished by the spinous processes. They are long and narrow. As a rule, the spinous processes of the foremost dorsal vertebrÃ¦ are the most developed and are directed obliquely upwards and backwards. As we approach the last vertebrÃ¦ of this region, the processes become shorter and tend to become vertical, and the last ones are even, in some cases, directed upwards and forwards; this disposition is well marked in the dog and the cat. In the cetaceans, on the contrary, the length of the spinous processes increases from the first to the last. [Illustration: FIG. 4.--LUMBAR VERTEBRÃ OF A QUADRUPED (THE HORSE): SUPERIOR SURFACE. 1, Spinous process; 2, anterior articular process and transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra of the left side; 3, costiform process.] In the horse the spinous processes of the first dorsal vertebrÃ¦ produce the prominence at the anterior limit of the trunk, where the mane ends, which is known as the _withers_. The lumbar vertebrÃ¦ are thicker than the preceding; they are known by their short and latterly-flattened spinous processes, and still more readily by their transverse processes, which, as they are evidently atrophied ribs, it is more accurate to denominate costiform processes (Fig. 4). These are long, flattened from above downwards, and directed outwards and forwards. The true transverse processes are represented by tubercles situated on the superior borders of the articular processes of each of the vertebrÃ¦ of the lumbar region. Apropos of these different osseous processes, we are reminded that they are also present in the human skeleton. In the horse the costiform processes of the fifth and sixth lumbar vertebrÃ¦ articulate, and are sometimes ankylosed, one with the other; the terminal ones articulate with the base of the sacrum. Sometimes the processes of the fourth and fifth are thus related; this is the case in the figure (4) given; here the costiform processes of the fourth and fifth vertebrÃ¦ articulate, and the two terminal ones have coalesced. In the ox, the same processes are more developed than in the horse; their summits elevating the skin, produce, especially in animals which have not much flesh, prominences which limit the flanks in the superior aspect. The costiform processes of the last lumbar vertebrÃ¦ are separate from each other; those of the latter are not in contact with the sacrum. =The Sacrum.=[3]--This bone, single and median, is formed by the mutual coalescence of several vertebrÃ¦, which vary in number according to the species observed. [3] In human anatomy, the sacrum and the coccyx are studied as part of the pelvis; we, therefore, in the study of the artistic anatomy of man, study these bones with the bones of the lower limbs. Here we do not follow this plan. In animals the sacrum and the coccyx, as a matter of fact, clearly continue the superior border of the skeleton of the trunk; hence we study them with the vertebral column. _VertebrÃ¦ Constituting the Sacrum._--Bears, 5; dogs, 3; cats, 3; rabbits, 4; swine, 4; horses, 5; camels, 4; oxen, 5; sheep, 4. The sacrum is situated between the two iliac bones; with which it articulates, and contributes to the formation of the pelvis. It is obliquely placed, from before backwards, and from below upwards; immediately behind the lumbar section of the vertebral column; and is continued by the coccygeal vertebrÃ¦, which form the skeleton of the tail. It is triangular in outline, and is generally more narrow in proportion than in the human being. All things considered, it is more large and massive, and of greater density, in species which sometimes assume the upright posture, rather than in those which cannot assume that attitude; for example, the sacrum of the ape, of the bear, of the dog, and of the opossum are proportionately larger than those of the horse.[4] [4] This is particularly striking only in those portions of the sacrum that are not in relation with the other bones of the pelvis. We think that the general form of this bone depends on the mode of its connexions with the iliac bones and the extent of the articular surfaces by which it is in contact with the latter. Its superior surface presents a crest, formed by the fusion of the spinous processes of the vertebrÃ¦ which form it. In certain species these processes are attached only by their bases, and are separated from each other superiorly. In the pig they are wholly wanting. =The Coccygeal VertebrÃ¦.=--These vertebrÃ¦, few in number (and sometimes ankylosed) in the human being, form in the latter a small series, the coccyx; which is inclined forwards, that is to say, towards the interior of the pelvis. In quadrupeds, on the contrary, their number is large; they are not ankylosed, and they form the skeleton of the caudal appendix. The first coccygeal vertebrÃ¦--that is, those which are next the sacrum--present characters which are common to those of other regions: they have a body, a foramen, and processes. As we trace them backwards, these characters become gradually effaced; and they become little more than small osseous cylinders simply expanded at their extremities. Direction and Form of the Spinal Column The curves of the vertebral column are, in quadrupeds, slightly different from those which characterize the human spine. First, instead of their being, as in the latter, curves in the antero-posterior aspect, because of the general attitude of the body, they are turned in the supero-inferior direction. The cervical region is not a single curve, as in the human being. It presents two: one superior, with its convexity looking upwards; the other inferior, the convexity of which is turned downwards. This arrangement reminds one of that of a console. The dorsal and lumbar regions are placed in a single curved line, more or less concave downwards; so that in the lumbar region there is no curve analogous to that which exists in man; a form which, in the latter, is due to the biped attitude--that is to say, the vertical position of the trunk. Briefly, there is in quadrupeds one dorso-lumbar curve; and not both a dorsal and a lumbar, with convexities in opposite directions. At the extremity of the dorso-lumbar region is the sacrum and the caudal appendix, which describe a curve of which the concavity is directed downwards and forwards. It is necessary to point out that it is not the curves of the three anterior portions of the spinal column which determine the form of the superior border of the neck and shoulders, and of the same part of the trunk. For the first portion, there is a ligament which surmounts the cervical region, and substitutes its modelling influence for that of the vertebrÃ¦. It is the _superior cervical ligament_, which arises from the spinous process of the first cervical vertebrÃ¦, and is inserted into the external occipital protuberance on the upper part of the posterior surface of the skull. The summits of the spinous processes of the vertebrÃ¦ alone give form to the superior median border of the trunk. In this connection we here repeat that it is not the general curvature of the vertebral column which produces the withers, but the great length of the spinous process of the first vertebrÃ¦ of the dorsal region. The Thorax The dorsal vertebrÃ¦ form the posterior limit in man, and superior in quadrupeds, of the region of the trunk known as the _thorax_. A single bone, the sternum, is situated at the aspect opposite; the ribs bound the thorax on its sides. In its general outlines the thorax in quadrupeds resembles that of man--that is to say, that, as in the latter, the anterior portion--superior in the human being--is narrower than the part opposite. But the progressive widening takes place in a more regular and continuous fashion, so that it presents a more definitely conical outline. This purely conical form is nevertheless found in the human species, but only during infancy; the inferior portion of the thoracic cage being then widely expanded, because of the development of the abdominal viscera, which at that period are relatively large. But the proportionate measurements of the thorax are different. Indeed, we may recall that in man the thorax is flattened from before backwards, so that the distance between the sternum and the vertebral column is shorter than the distance from the rib of one side to the corresponding one of the opposite side (Fig. 5). In animals, on the contrary, it is flattened laterally. Its vertical diameter--measured from the sternum to the vertebral column--is greater than the transverse measurement (Fig. 6). [Illustration: FIG. 5.--A TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE THORAX OF A MAN PLACED VERTICALLY--THAT IS TO SAY, IN THE DIRECTION WHICH IT WOULD ASSUME IN A MAN PLACED IN THE ATTITUDE OF A QUADRUPED (A DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE). 1, Dorsal vertebra; 2, sternal region; 3, costal region of one side; 3Â´, costal region of the other side.] From this results a peculiar arrangement of the muscles that we are able to bring directly into prominence, which presents points of interest from the point of view of the contraction of the subcutaneous layer. Indeed, in man the region occupied by the pectorals is very broad; it is a wide surface turned directly forward. In quadrupeds, this region of the pectorals is narrowed. It is not spread out, as in the preceding instances; and the appearance it presents is explained by the fact that the thorax is compressed laterally. If we examine the thorax on one of its lateral surfaces, the muscles, on the contrary, are more extended. We see the contour of the vertebral column, and the median part of the abdomen; and, especially in the horse, between the great dorsal and the great oblique of the abdomen, we find a large space, in which the ribs, with the intercostals which join them, are uncovered; the muscles in question separate the one from the other, under the influence, it would seem, of the great dimensions of the lateral wall of the thorax. [Illustration: FIG. 6.--A VERTICAL SECTION OF THE THORAX OF A QUADRUPED (DIAGRAMMATIC). 1, Fifth dorsal vertebra; 2, sternal region; 3, costal region of one side; 3Â´, costal region of the opposite side.] =The Sternum.=--The sternum is, in quadrupeds, directed obliquely downwards and backwards; its form varies in different species. In the carnivora, it consists of eight bones, irregularly cylindrical in form, being slightly flattened from within outwards, and thickened at their extremities. They remain separate, and this contributes elasticity and flexibility to the thorax. The first nine costal cartilages articulate directly with the sternum. The first of these cartilages articulates with a nodule situated a little above the middle of the first bone of the sternum. In the horse the sternum is flattened laterally in its anterior portion, and from above downwards in its posterior half. The six bones which form the sternum are connected by cartilage. The keel-shaped piece, situated in front of the sternum, is also cartilaginous. This process, but slightly marked posteriorly, becomes more and more prominent in front, and terminates at its anterior extremity by a prolongation, slightly curved backwards, which projects for some centimetres beyond the cavity in which the first costal cartilage is received. This process is known as the _tracheal process_, or _rostral cartilage_. The posterior extremity of the sternum, flattened from above downwards, ends in a cartilaginous plate; concave superiorly, and convex inferiorly: this is the abdominal prolongation, or _xiphoid appendix_. In the ox, the sternum is formed of two distinct bones, which are united by an articulation. One, the anterior, is short, and forms the first portion of the sternum; it is slightly flattened from side to side, and vertical in direction. The other, the posterior, is longer, and is formed by the fusion of several small bones; it is placed horizontally, and is flattened from above downwards. At the level of articulation of these two portions, and because of their different directions, the bone is bent. This bend occurs at the point of articulation of the second costal cartilage. On the superior border of the anterior segment the cartilage of the first rib is articulated. The xiphoid appendix, which is cartilaginous, is attached to the extremity of a long process of the last bone of the sternum. The shape of the anterior extremity of the sternum is influenced by the presence or absence of clavicles. We have seen that in some quadrupeds the clavicles are wanting. In the first case, this extremity is large, and approaches in shape to the corresponding part of the human sternum, which is so clearly designed to give a point of support to the anterior bone of the shoulder. In the second, on the contrary, this extremity is narrow. The sternum in birds is very different from that in mammalia, which we have been studying. It varies greatly in extent and shape, under the influence of certain conditions. To understand the cause of these variations it is necessary to remember that in man (as, indeed, in other animals; but the example of man, for that which follows, will be more striking, on account of the mobility of his upper limbs) the sternum gives origin to the pectoral muscles, and that these muscles are inserted into other parts of the thoracic limbs, designed by their contraction to draw the arms downwards, forwards, and inwards--that is, when these are in a state of abduction and in a horizontal direction, they draw them towards the anterior surface of the thorax and downwards. Now, this movement is similar to that made by birds during flight. It is necessary to add that, in the latter case, the more the displacement of the upper limbs has of force and extent, the more the pectoral muscles are developed. For these reasons, birds, in which, during flight, the movements of the thoracic limbs--the wings--are necessarily energetic, present a great development of the pectoral muscles; having consequently, because an extent of surface for the origin of the muscles commensurate with their development is necessary, a very large and peculiarly shaped sternum (Figs. 18, 6; and 21, 6). Indeed, not only is the sternum large, but, further, in order to form a deeper surface, proportionately adapted to the muscles which arise from and cover it, its anterior surface presents, in the median line, a prominent crest known as the _keel_. This prominence forms two lateral fossÃ¦. We cite as examples, the sternum of the eagle, the vulture, the falcon, and the hawk. All birds are not, however, equally adapted to flight, for in the domestic cock, which flies but a short distance, and badly, the sternum is less developed (Fig. 7); it is also diminished by slots, which diminish its surface. These slots, two on each side, are called from their position the internal and external slots. They are bounded by narrow, elongated, bony processes, an internal and an external; the expanded lower extremity of the latter overlaps the last inferior ribs (see p. 19). The part of the external border which surmounts this external process is hollowed out into grooves, which receive the inferior ribs, and terminates superiorly in an osseous projection known as _the costal prominence_. In the ostrich, the cassowary, and the apteryx, which run, but do not fly, the sternum has the form of a plate of bone slightly convex, but without a keel. [Illustration: FIG. 7.--STERNUM OF A BIRD (THE COCK): LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Keel; 2, internal slot; 3, external slot; 4, internal process; 5, external process; 6, inferior ribs; 7, costal process; 8, surface for articulation with the coracoid bone.] The shape of the sternum, correlated to the faculty of flight (or of swimming; apropos of which we may cite the penguin, of which the rudimentary wings resemble fins, and perform their functions only), or the absence of this faculty, has furnished the division of birds into two groups. In one are included, under the name _Carinates_ (_carina_, keel), those in which the sternum is provided with a keel; in the other division are those in which the sternum is not furnished with one. These latter, on account of their unique mode of progression, are more nearly allied to the mammals. The keel is developed in flying mammals (bats). =Ribs and Costal Cartilages.=--There are on each side of the thorax as many ribs as there are dorsal vertebrÃ¦. In animals, as in man, the ribs which articulate with the sternum by their cartilages are called _true_, or _sternal_ ribs; those whose cartilages do not articulate with the sternum are called _false_, or _asternal_. The longer ribs are those situated in the middle region of the thorax. The ribs are directed obliquely downwards and backwards, and this obliquity is more marked in the posterior ones than in the anterior. They are, however, less oblique than in the human being; what proves this is that the first rib in man is oblique, while in quadrupeds it is vertical. The curvature of the ribs is less pronounced in quadrupeds than in the human being, but this is not equal in all animals. The ribs of the bear are more curved than those of the dog; the latter has ribs more curved than those of the horse. Each rib, at its vertebral extremity, presents, from within outwards, a wedge-shaped head for articulation with two dorsal vertebrÃ¦, a neck, and a tuberosity. External to the tubercle are found some rough impressions, for muscular attachments, which correspond to the angle of the human rib. In the following table, we give the number and classification of the ribs of some animals: NUMBER OF THE RIBS ON EACH SIDE OF THE THORAX. Sternal. Asternal. Bear 14 divided into 9 and 5 Dog 13 "" "" 9 "" 4 Cat 13 "" "" 9 "" 4 Rabbit 12 "" "" 7 "" 5 Pig 14 "" "" 7 "" 7 Horse 18 "" "" 8 "" 10 Camel 12 "" "" 8 "" 4 Ox 13 "" "" 8 "" 5 Sheep 13 "" "" 8 "" 5 The costal cartilages, by which the first ribs are united to the sternum (sternal ribs), whilst the latter are united one to the other without being directly connected with the sternum (asternal ribs), are, as a rule, in quadrupeds, directed obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards; each forms, with the rib to which it belongs, an obtuse angle more or less open anteriorly. Their length is proportionate to that of the ribs. The cartilages, which are continued from the asternal ribs, unite and form the borders, directed obliquely downwards and forwards, of the fossa which is found at the inferior and posterior part of the thorax, and which forms the lateral limits of the epigastric region. In the dog and cat the ribs are thick and almost cylindrical; the costal cartilages are thicker at the margin of the sternum than at their costal extremity. In the ox, the ribs are flattened laterally and are very broad, the more so as we examine a portion further from the vertebral column. From the second to the twelfth they are quadrangular in the superior fourth, and thicker than in the rest of their extent. The first costal cartilage is vertical; the following ones are progressively more oblique in a direction downwards and forwards. The four or five cartilages which succeed the first unite with slight obliquity to the sternum; their union with that bone gives the impression of a very strong, well-knit apparatus. The costal cartilages which unite with the sternum are flattened laterally in the portions next the ribs, and flattened from front to back in the rest of their extent. In the horse the ribs increase in length from the first to the ninth; they are flattened from without inwards, and increase in width from the first to the sixth or seventh, and the following ones become narrower. The costal cartilages, from the second to the eighth, are, as in the ox, at first flattened laterally, near the ribs; while near the sternum they are flattened from front to back. In birds, the ribs are each furnished with a flat process (Fig. 18, 10), which springs from the posterior border, is directed backwards, and overlaps the external surface of the succeeding rib. These processes are not found, as a rule, on the first or last ribs. As for the costal cartilages, they are, as a rule, ossified, and receive the name of inferior ribs (Fig. 18, 11), united to the preceding (superior ribs; Fig. 18, 9) by articulation; by the other extremity they are joined to the sternum; the first superior ribs generally want them. Sometimes the last inferior rib becomes connected with the one that precedes it, not articulating with the sternum; and thus recalls the relations of the asternal ribs which we have noticed in our study of the mammals. In the bat, as in birds, the costal cartilages are ossified. THE ANTERIOR LIMBS[5] [5] Consult Figs. 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 46. The anterior limbs, homologous to the upper limbs in man, are formed, as in the latter, of four segments: the shoulder, the arm, the forearm, and the hand. These limbs, considered in the vertebral series, present themselves under very different aspects, which are determined by the functions they are called upon to perform. They constitute the forepaw in terrestrial mammals; in aerial vertebrates they form wings; in aqueous mammals they act as paddles. In whatever series we study them, we can readily find the relationship of the different parts; it is very easy to recognise the same bones in the upper limbs of the human being, the wings of the bat (Fig. 8) and of birds (Fig. 21), and in the anterior paddles of the seal (Fig. 9) and of the dolphin. [Illustration: FIG. 8.--ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE BAT: LEFT SIDE, ANTERIOR SURFACE. 1, Clavicle; 2, scapula; 3, humerus; 4, radius; 5, cubitus; 6, carpus; 7, thumb; 8, metacarpus; 9, phalanges.] In quadrupeds, the shoulder and arm are hidden, the latter more or less completely, in the muscular mass which binds it to the lateral wall of the trunk; so that the anterior limbs only present; free from the trunk: the elbow, forearm, and hand. The Shoulder In some vertebrates, the shoulder is formed of two bones--the scapula and clavicle; in others of only one bone--the scapula; the clavicle in this case does not exist. =The Scapula or Omoplate.=--The scapula is situated on the lateral surface of the thorax, and is directed obliquely, from above downwards and from behind forwards. We must first recall, so as to be able to make a comparison, that in man this bone is placed at the posterior surface of the thoracic cage; so that if we look at the human thorax on one of its lateral aspects we see chiefly the external border of the scapula; it is the external surface (homologous to the posterior surface of the human scapula) which we see in its full extent when we look on the same surface of the thorax in quadrupeds. [Illustration: FIG. 9.--ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE SEAL: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Scapula; 2, humerus; 3, radius; 4, ulna; 5, carpus; 6, metacarpus; 7, phalanges of the fingers.] To sum up, if we fancy the human being in the position of the quadruped, the scapula will have its surfaces almost parallel to the ground (Fig. 10); while in quadrupeds, the surfaces are situated in a plane which is almost perpendicular to the ground (Fig. 11). This position of the scapula in an almost vertical plane is designed to give the necessary point of support to the osseous columns that form the skeleton of the other portions of the anterior limbs. Because of this position of the scapula (Figs. 12 and 13), the spinal border is superior, the cervical, anterior, and the axillary, posterior. In direct contrast to what obtains in the human scapula, the spinal border is the shortest of the three; except in the bat, and the majority of the cetaceans. [Illustration: FIG. 10.--SITUATION AND DIRECTION OF THE SCAPULA IN THE HUMAN BEING, THE TRUNK BEING HORIZONTAL, AS IN QUADRUPEDS. VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE THORAX (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE). 1, Contour of the thorax; 2, 2, the scapula.] [Illustration: FIG. 11.--POSITION AND DIRECTION OF THE SCAPULA IN QUADRUPEDS. VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE THORAX (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE). 1, Contour of the thorax; 2, 2, the scapula.] In certain animals (in the ungulates [_hoofed_[6]]--pigs, oxen, sheep, horses) the superior, or spinal, border of the scapula is surmounted by a cartilage called _the cartilage of prolongation_. [6] For the definition of the word _hoofed_, see p. 37. This is the cause why the border to which it is fixed is so slightly noticeable under the skin in these animals; indeed, in the upper part, the bone and cartilage are not distinguishable in the contour of the corresponding region of the back; being applied to the lateral surfaces of the spinous processes, the prominence formed by the extremities of which is directly continuous with the plane of the scapula (Fig. 16). [Illustration: FIG. 12.--LEFT SCAPULA OF THE HUMAN BEING, POSTERIOR SURFACE, PLACED IN THE POSITION WHICH IT WOULD OCCUPY IN THE SKELETON OF A QUADRUPED. 1, Cervical border; 2, spinal border; 3, axillary border; 4, supraspinous fossa; 5, subspinous fossa; 6, scapular spine; 7, glenoid cavity; 8, coracoid process; 9, acromion process.] [Illustration: FIG. 13.--LEFT SCAPULA OF A HORSE: EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Cervical border; 2, spinal border--the scapula here represented, being from a hoofed animal, has a cartilage of extension attached to its spinal border; 3, axillary border; 4, supraspinous fossa; 5, subspinous fossa; 6, spine of the scapula; 7, glenoid cavity; 8, coracoid process. The scapula of the horse has no acromion process, but it is easy, if we compare the human scapula, to judge of the position which this process would occupy if it were present.] In quadrupeds whose scapula, on the contrary, is wanting in the cartilage of prolongation (in the _clawed_,[7] such as the cat and dog), the superior border of the scapula is visible, especially when the animal is resting on its fore-limbs, particularly when it crouches; at such a time the skin is markedly raised by that border; and the spinous processes of the vertebrÃ¦, beyond which it projects, occupy the bottom of a fossa (Fig. 15). The internal surface of the scapula is turned towards the ribs; it is known, as in man (in whom this surface is anterior), as the subscapular fossa. [7] For the definition of this word, see p. 37. [Illustration: FIG. 14.--VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION, AT THE SITE OF THE SHOULDERS, OF THE THORAX OF THE HORSE (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE). 1, Outline of the thorax at the level of the third dorsal vertebra; 2, 2, scapula; 3, spinal border of the scapula; 4, cartilage of prolongation; 5, contour of the skin.] [Illustration: FIG. 15.--VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION, AT THE PLANE OF THE SHOULDERS, OF THE THORAX OF A DOG (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE). 1, Outline of the thorax at the level of the third dorsal vertebra; 2, 2, scapula; 3, spinal border of the scapula; 4, contour of the skin.] Its external surface is divided into two parts by the spine of the scapula; which, in some animals, terminates inferiorly in a flat and clearly distinct process, the homologue of the acromion process of the human scapula. The two regions separated by the spine are known as the supraspinous fossa and the infraspinous fossa. The supraspinous fossa is anterior to the spine, and the infraspinous is posterior to it. The surfaces of the scapula are, in quadrupeds, flatter than in the human being, and in particular the subscapular fossa, which is also less concave. Some authors attribute this to the lesser curvature of the ribs in quadrupeds. A few words will suffice to prove that there must be another reason. The scapula is not in immediate contact with the ribs; the subscapular fossa is not moulded on them. Besides, the form of the scapula is, as in other parts of the skeleton, dependent on the disposition of muscles, and the development of these latter is correlated to the extent and energy of the movements which the individual is able or required to execute. But the movements which those muscles produce (more especially the rotation of the humerus) are, in quadrupeds, less extensive than in the human being; and, consequently, the muscles which produce them are, proportionally, less strongly developed. The inferior angle (superior and external in man), situated at the junction of the cervical and axillary borders, presents the glenoid cavity, which, looking downwards, receives the articular surface of the superior extremity of the bone of the arm--that is to say, the head of the humerus. Above this cavity, on the lower part of the cervical border, is situated a tubercle which reminds us of the coracoid process of the human scapula. The region occupied by the glenoid cavity is separated from the body of the bone by a constriction--the neck of the scapula. In birds the scapula is elongated in a direction parallel to the vertebral column, and very narrow in the opposite (Fig. 18): it is also flat, and has no spine. Its coracoid process is represented by a peculiar bone--the coracoidean or coracoid bone--which we shall describe later on when we come to the study of the clavicle and of the anterior region of the shoulder (see p. 26). =The Clavicle.=--The clavicle is found only in the human being, and in animals whose anterior limbs, possessing great freedom of movement in all directions, require that the scapula should possess a point of support which, while affording this, can be displaced with it, or draw it in certain directions. Now, this point of support is furnished by the clavicle. In animals possessed of hoofs (ungulates), such as the sheep, ox, and horse, the clavicle does not exist. Indeed, in them the freedom of movement of the anterior limbs is limited; they move by projection in the forward and backward directions only; they merely fulfil the functions of giving support to and carrying about the body. The clavicle is rudimentary in the cat and the dog; in the cat it is a small, elongated bone (Fig. 16), 2 centimetres in length, thin and curved, connected with the sternum and the scapula by ligamentous bundles. In the dog it is represented by a small osseous plate only (Fig. 17), which is not connected with any of the neighbouring bones. It is on the deep surface of a muscle which passes from the head and neck to the humerus (mastoido-humeral, a muscle common to the arm, neck, and head) in which this rudimentary bone is found to be developed. The clavicle exists in perfect state in mammals which use their limbs for digging, grasping, or flying; the insectivora (hedgehog, mole) and some rodents (squirrel, woodchuck) are provided with it. The cheiroptera (bats) possess an extremely well-developed clavicle, on account of the varied movements which their thoracic limbs execute. [Illustration: FIG. 16.--LEFT CLAVICLE OF THE CAT: SUPERIOR SURFACE (NATURAL SIZE). 1, Internal extremity; 2, external extremity.] [Illustration: FIG. 17.--CLAVICLE OF THE DOG (NATURAL SIZE).] This formation of the shoulder which favours flight in the bat is even more remarkable in birds. In these latter (Fig. 18) the clavicles, fused together by their lower extremities, form one bone, having the shape of the letter V or U, which is known as the _fourchette_; this bone, acting as a true spring, keeps the shoulders apart, and prevents their approximation during the energetic movements which flight necessitates. In birds whose power of flight is strong, the two limbs of this bone are widely separated and thick, and the fourchette is U-shaped. Those whose flight is awkward and but slightly energetic have the limbs of the fourchette slender; they unite at a more acute angle, and the bone is V shaped. Furthermore, a bone named the _coracoid_ joins the scapula to the sternum; this bone, often fused with the scapula, where it contributes to the formation of the glenoid cavity, represents in birds the coracoid process of the human scapula. If we fancy this process directed inwards, and sufficiently lengthened to join the sternum, we shall have an idea of the disposition of the bone we are now discussing, and the reasons for which the name has been chosen by which it is designated. The coracoid bone, like the fourchette which it reinforces, offers to the wings a degree of support proportionate to the efforts developed by those limbs; for this reason it is thick and solid in birds of powerful flight. [Illustration: FIG. 18.--SKELETON OF THE SHOULDER OF A BIRD (VULTURE): ANTERO-EXTERNAL VIEW OF THE LEFT SIDE. 1, Left clavicle; 2, inferior portion of the right clavicle, forming by its ankylosis with that of the other side the fourchette; 3, coracoid bone; 4, scapula; 5, articular surface for humerus; 6, superior half of the sternum; 7, keel of sternum; 8, spinous process of the dorsal vertebrÃ¦; 9, superior ribs; 10, process of one of these ribs; 11, inferior ribs.] The superior extremity of each branch of the fourchette, at the level of its junction with the coracoid and the scapula, bounds, with these latter, a foramen which gives passage to the tendon of the elevator muscle of the wing, or small pectoral. The importance of the fourchette being, as we have seen, in proportion to the movements of flying, it is easy to understand that the bone is not found in the ostrich. The Arm A single bone, the humerus, forms the skeleton of this portion of the thoracic limb. =The Humerus.=--The bone of the arm is, in quadrupeds, inclined from above downwards and from before backwards. It is, with relation to other regions, short in proportion as the metacarpus is elongated, and as the number of digits is lessened. In the horse, for example, whose metacarpus is long, and in which but one digit is apparent, the humerus is very short. The slight development in length of the humerus explains its close application to the side of the animal as far as the elbow. In animals in which the humerus is longer, the bone is slightly free, as well as the elbow, at its inferior extremity. Later on we will return to the consideration of this peculiarity and of the proportions of the humerus, after we have studied the other parts of the fore-limbs. The humerus in quadrupeds is inflected like the letter S; in man this general form is less accentuated, the humerus being almost straight. On its body, which appears twisted on its own axis, we find the musculo-spiral groove,[8] which crosses the external surface, and is very deep in some animals. Above this groove, and on the external surface, there exists a rough surface which is the impression of the deltoid. In some species this rugosity is very prominent, and is called _the tuberosity of the deltoid_; it is prolonged downwards by a border which forms the anterior crest of the musculo-spiral groove and limits this latter in front. The external border of the bone, or posterior crest of the groove, limits it behind. [8] It would be going outside our province to discuss whether the humerus is really twisted on its axis. This question, often discussed, has been solved in some recent works in the following manner: the humerus has undergone torsion at the level of its superior extremity, and not at the level of its body; this does not authorize us further to accord any definite sense to the denomination 'groove of torsion' (musculo-spiral groove). That which we must especially remember in connection with this fact, is, as we shall afterwards see, the difference of direction which the articular head presents according as the torsion has been more or less considerable: because this is established, according to the same order, in man and in quadrupeds. The superior extremity is enlarged, and remarkable in three portions which it presents; these are: an articular surface and two tuberosities. The articular surface, or head of the humerus, smooth and round, is in contact with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. This head in the human skeleton is directed upwards and inwards; in quadrupeds its direction is upwards and backwards. The inferior extremity, having in both one and the other its long axis directed transversely, and the point of the elbow looking backwards in all, the result is that the head of the humerus is not situated vertically above the same regions; in the first, it is almost directly above the internal part of this extremity; in the latter, it is situated above its posterior surface, or the point of the elbow in the complete skeleton. This difference of direction is correlated with the position of the scapula, the glenoid cavity of which, as we have already seen, is in man turned outwards, whereas in quadrupeds it looks downwards. In the latter case the scapula consequently rests on the head of the humerus; and this position is most favourable for the performance of the functions which the anterior limbs have to fulfil in these latter. Of the tuberosities of the head of the humerus, one is situated on the external aspect--it is the great tuberosity, or _trochiter_; the other is placed internally--it is the small tuberosity, or _trochin_. The great tuberosity is divided into three parts--summit, convexity, and crest; these different parts give insertion to the muscles of the shoulder. We recollect that the facets (anterior, middle, and posterior) of the great tuberosity of the humerus in man give attachment to the muscles of the same region. The head of the humerus in the human body projects above the tuberosities. We shall see afterwards, when dealing with some special quadrupeds, that in some of these, on the other hand, the tuberosities are on a higher level than the articular head of the bone. Between the two tuberosities is the bicipital groove. In man, the superior extremity of the humerus, although covered by the deltoid, reveals its presence by elevating the corresponding portion of the latter. In quadrupeds, the anterior part of this extremity, although similarly covered by muscular bundles, produces a prominence under the skin. This prominence is situated at the summit of the angle formed by the opposing directions of the scapula and the bone of the arm, and constitutes what is known by the name of the _point of the shoulder_, or of the _point of the arm_. The inferior extremity, transversely enlarged, presents an undulating articular surface, which reminds us of the trochlea and the condyle of the human humerus; on which, however, the condyle is more sharply defined from the trochlea. In the human skeleton, the internal lip of the trochlea descends lower than the external; and also lower than the condyle. In the bear, the cat, and the dog, it is the same. In the ox and the sheep, the condyle is lower than the trochlea, but only very little lower. In the horse the arrangement is still the same, but a little more accentuated. On the lateral parts of this extremity we find: internally, a prominence, the epitrochlea; and, externally, another, the epicondyle. It is from this latter that the crest arises, which, passing upwards, forms the posterior limit of the groove of torsion. The two prominences, which we have just described from a general point of view, present special arrangements which it is necessary to point out. When we examine the form of the outline of the inferior extremity of the humerus in man, the bear, the cat, the dog, the ox, and the horse, we find in following this order that the extremity tends to become narrow transversely, and that the epicondyle and the epitrochlea are less and less prominent on the external and internal aspects respectively. These two processes, indeed, project backwards; the epitrochlea always remaining more developed than the epicondyle. Because of this projection backwards, the cavity situated on the posterior surface of the inferior extremity, the olecranon fossa, is very deep, more so than in the humerus of man. Its borders being thus formed by the two processes, are very prominent. In front we find the coronoid fossa, which is less deep than that of which we have just spoken. There exists in some mammals an osseous canal, situated above the epitrochlea, and known as the _supratrochlear canal_ (Fig. 19). It is bounded by a plate of bone which at its middle portion is detached from the shaft of the humerus, and blends with the latter at both its extremities. The brachial artery and median nerve pass through the foramen. [Illustration: FIG. 19.--INFERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE LEFT HUMERUS OF A FELIDE (LION). 1, Epitrochlea; 2, supra-epitrochlear foramen.] [Illustration: FIG. 20.--INFERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE LEFT HUMAN HUMERUS, SHOWING THE PRESENCE OF A SUPRATROCHLEAR PROCESS. 1, Epitrochlea; 2, supra-epitrochlear process.] A similar condition is sometimes found, as an abnormality, in man, which presents itself under the following aspect (Fig. 20): an osseous prominence more or less long, in the shape of a crochet-needle--supra-epitrochlear process--situated 5 or 6 centimetres above the epitrochlea; the summit of this process gives attachment to a fibrous band, which is inserted by its other end into the epitrochlea and the internal intermuscular aponeurosis. The fibro-osseous ring thus formed gives passage to the brachial artery and the median nerve, or in case of a premature division of this artery to the ulnar branch of the same.[9] [9] For further details of this anomaly, see Testut, 'The Epitrochlear Process in Man' (_International Journal of Anatomy and Physiology_, 1889); A. Nicolas, 'New Studies on the Supratrochlear Process in Man' (_Review of Biology of the North of France_, t. iii., 1890-1891). There is also found in some mammals a perforation of the thin plate of bone which, in others, separates the olecranon fossa from the coronoid. This perforation is sometimes found as an abnormality in the human humerus. As does the sternum and the skeleton of the shoulder, the humerus of birds presents differences correlated to the functions which the thoracic limbs are destined to fulfil. Lying on the side of the thorax, directed obliquely downwards and backwards (Fig. 21), it is proportionately longer in individuals of powerful flight than in those which fly less or not at all. In the vulture it projects beyond the posterior part of the pelvis; in the cock it does not even reach the anterior border of the same. To these differences in length are added differences in volume and in the development of the processes which serve for muscular attachment, which are more considerable in birds of powerful flight. The humerus is so placed that the radial border, external in man and quadrupeds, looks upwards, with the result that the surface of the bone of the arm, which in these latter is anterior, in the former looks outwards. The humeral head, which is turned forwards and a little inwards, is convex and elongated in the vertical direction. Behind and above this head is found a crest for the insertion of muscles. It is the same for the region below, where there is a tuberosity whose inferior surface presents a pretty large opening which looks inwards to a fossa from the floor of which a number of minute openings communicate with the interior of the bone. This is the pneumatic foramen of the humerus. It is of interest to remember in connection with this subject that in birds, in keeping with the conditions of flight, every system of organs is adapted to diminish the weight of the body. We particularly draw attention to the osseous framework, the structure of which is such that the weight of the animal is greatly lessened. This condition is secured by the pneumaticity. The bone consists of a cover of compact tissue, which, instead of enclosing marrow, is hollowed out by cavities which contain air, and communicate with special pouches, the air-sacs, which are appendages of the lungs.[10] [10] The presence of air in the bones does not seem to be always associated with the power of flight; as a matter of fact, we find air spaces in the bones of some birds which do not fly (E. J. Marey, 'The Flight of Birds,' Paris, 1890, p. 51). [Illustration: FIG. 21.--SKELETON OF A BIRD (VULTURE): LEFT SURFACE. 1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, cervical vertebrÃ¦; 4, spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrÃ¦; 5, coccygeal vertebrÃ¦; 6, sternum; 7, keel; 8, superior ribs; 9, inferior ribs; 10, clavicle; 11, coracoid bone (for the details of the skeleton of the shoulder, see Fig. 18); 12, humerus; 13, radius; 14, ulna; 15, carpus; 16, hand (for details of the skeleton of this region, see Fig. 31); 17, ilium; 18, ischium; 19, pubis (for the details of the pelvis, see Fig. 46); 20, femur; 21, tibia; 22, fibula; 23, osseous nodule, which some anatomists think represents the calcaneum; it is the sole vestige of the tarsus; 24, metatarsus; 25, foot; 26, first toe (for the details of the skeleton of the foot, see Fig. 48).] The antibrachial extremity of the humerus is flattened from without inwards. It terminates in two articular surfaces, which articulate with the radius and ulna. The olecranon process of the ulna being slightly developed, it follows that the olecranon fossa is not large; neither is the coronoid. General View of the Form of the Forearm and Hand We now proceed to the study of the two regions of the fore-limbs which present the greatest variety in regard to the number of bones and also in regard to form and proportions. These two regions are the forearm and the hand. It is first of all necessary to say that in man, when the fore-limb hangs beside the body, and the dorsum of the hand looks backwards, the two bones of the forearm are parallel, and that this position is known by the name of _supination_. It is also necessary to remember that there is another attitude, in which the radius, crossing the ulna, and carrying the hand with it, displaces the latter in such a way that the palmar surface looks backwards. This second position is known as _pronation_. Let us now suppose that a man wishes to walk in the attitude of a quadruped. It will be necessary, in order that his upper limbs, being for the moment anterior ones, may act as members of support, to place the forearm in pronation, in order that, as is more normal, the hands may rest on the ground by their palmar surfaces. In this position the radius, being rotated on its own axis at its upper extremity and around the ulna in the rest of its extent, shall have its inferior extremity situated on the inner side of the corresponding extremity of the latter. Such is the situation of the bones of the forearm and the attitude of the hand in quadrupeds. In short, quadrupeds have their anterior members in the position of pronation. The individual whom we have just supposed placed in the attitude of a quadruped would be able to maintain this position by pressing on the ground more or less extensive portions of his hands; the whole palm of the hand may be applied to the ground (Fig. 22); or the fingers only--that is to say, the phalanges (Fig. 23); or the extremities of the fingers only--that is to say, the third phalanges (Fig. 24). This last position, which is certainly difficult to maintain, should here be regarded rather as theoretical. We shall meet with each of these modes of support in certain groups of animals. Thus, the bear, badger, and the majority of rodents, have the paws applied to the ground by the whole extent of the palmar surface of the hand, from the wrist to the tips of the fingers. They are therefore called plantigrade, from the analogy, in this case, of the palm of the hand to the plantar surface, or sole of the foot. [Illustration: FIG. 22.--THE HUMAN HAND RESTING FOR ITS WHOLE EXTENT ON ITS PALMAR SURFACE: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.] In others, such as the lion, tiger, panther, cat, wolf, and fox, the support is made no longer on the whole extent of the palmar surface, but on the corresponding surface of the fingers only--the metacarpus is turned back, and, consequently, the wrist--that is to say, the carpus--is removed from the ground. These are the digitigrades. Lastly, the ruminants (sheep, oxen, deer, etc.), and also the pig, ass, and horse, rest on the third phalanx only. In them not only is the metacarpus turned back, but also the two first phalanges. The wrist is very far removed from the ground. In these animals, the third phalanx is enclosed in a case of horn, a nail (the hoof), and because the support of the limb is on that nail, the name of unguligrades has been given them. Nevertheless, as the point of support is on the third phalanx, which is also known by the name of phalangette, we are of opinion that, in order to specify definitely, although they walk on their fingers, as do the digitigrades, the support is provided not by the whole extent of those appendages, they might receive the name of phalangettigrades. [Illustration: FIG. 23.--THE HUMAN HAND RESTING ON ITS PHALANGES: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.] [Illustration: FIG. 24.--THE HUMAN HAND RESTING ON THE TIPS OF SOME OF ITS THIRD PHALANGES: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL VIEW.] It is necessary among the ruminants to make an exception of the camel and the llama, which are digitigrades. Just in proportion as the hand is raised from the ground, as we have just seen in passing from the plantigrades to the digitigrades and unguligrades, the number of bones of that region diminishes, the bones of the forearm coalesce, and the ulna tends to disappear; the hand becomes less and less suitable for grasping, climbing, or digging, so as to form an organ exclusively adapted for walking and supporting the body. Thus, the bear (plantigrade) has five digits, and the power of performing the movements of supination and pronation. Indeed, we know with what facility this animal is able to move his paws in every direction, and climb a tree by grasping it with his fore-limbs. It is well known, however, that no animal except the ape can perform the movements of rotation of the radius around the ulna with the same facility as man; and that none possesses the same degree of suppleness, extent, and variety of movements of the forearm and hand. In the digitigrades there is one finger which is but slightly developed, and which is always removed from the ground--that is, the thumb: there is also a little less mobility of the radius around the ulna. In the ungulates the limbs are simply required to perform the movements of walking, and form veritable columns of support, which become the more solid as they are less divided. The bones of the forearm are fused together; there is therefore no possibility of rotation of the radius around the ulna. The metacarpus is reduced to a single piece, which in the horse constitutes what is known as the _canon_. The number of digits becomes diminished, so that in ruminants there are not more than two, and in the horse but one. We should, however, add that, up to the present, we have taken into account only perfect digits, those that rest on the ground. We shall see further on that there exist supplementary digits, but that they are only slightly developed, and are represented in some cases by mere osseous spurs; it is this fact that has permitted us to ignore them in the general study which we have just made. Because, as we have already said, the unguligrades have the inferior extremity of the digit encased in a horny sheath, which forms the hoof of the horse and the corresponding structures (_onglons_) in the ox, those animals have been placed in a special group, which is based on that peculiarity--that is, the group of ungulate mammals. The plantigrades and digitigrades, of which the paws have their surfaces of support strengthened by an epidermic sole and fatty pads, have the free extremities of the third phalanges covered on their dorsal surface by nails or claws; hence they are named _unguiculate_ mammals. The bat and birds have the bones of the forearm so arranged that the radius cannot rotate around the ulna. This is necessary in order that during flight, when the wing is being lowered, the radius and hand shall not be able to turn; for, if such rotation took place, each stroke of the wing would place it in a vertical position, which would occasion a loss of resistance incompatible with the effect to be obtained. The Forearm The skeleton of the forearm in quadrupeds is vertical in direction; consequently, it forms with the arm an angle open anteriorly; this is well seen on examining the lateral surface. If we examine it on its anterior surface, we find a slight obliquity directed downwards and inwards. In animals in which the bones of the forearm are separate--that is to say, susceptible of supination and pronation--we find a more close resemblance to those of the human skeleton. The ulna, the superior extremity of which always projects beyond that of the radius, has a shaft which gradually narrows from above downwards. Its inferior extremity is terminated by a round head in those animals in which the ulna is fully developed; in others, as it is atrophied, it ends in a thin, long process. The ulna presents at its superior extremity a posterior process, the olecranon, which forms the point of the elbow. We find on the anterior surface of the same, another process, the coronoid. It is necessary to dwell on the relations of these parts. In man the head of the radius is situated at the anterior part of the external surface of the superior extremity of the ulna (Fig. 25); indeed, the small sigmoid cavity with which the head articulates is situated on the outer side of the coronoid process, and this apophysis is placed in front. In the plantigrades and digitigrades the head of the radius is placed still more forward, so much so that it is situated almost in front of the superior extremity of the ulna (Fig. 26). In the unguligrades it is placed directly in front of this latter (Fig. 27). Further, the displacement of the radius is made at the expense of the superior extremity of the neighbouring bone; the radius appears to appropriate more and more the parts which in man belong exclusively to the ulna--for example, the coronoid process. In the plantigrades and the digitigrades half of the process still belongs to the ulna and the remainder to the radius. In the ungulates--the horse, for example--the coronoid process belongs to the radius; the ulna, situated behind the latter, is correspondingly diminished in size. [Illustration: FIG. 25.--SUPERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE HUMAN FOREARM: LEFT SIDE, SUPERIOR SURFACE. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, olecranon process; 4, coronoid process.] [Illustration: FIG. 26.--SUPERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE FOREARM OF THE DOG: LEFT LIMB, SUPERIOR SURFACE. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, olecranon process; 4, coronoid process.] In brief, when we study this region of the skeleton in plantigrades, then in digitigrades, and finally in unguligrades, we find a kind of progressive absorption of one of the two bones (ulna) by the other (radius), which thus becomes the more developed. It is easy to explain this partial disappearance of the ulna. When the forearm is capable of performing the movements of pronation and supination, the ulna is completely developed, for it is in its small sigmoid cavity that the head of the radius revolves, and it is around its inferior extremity, the head, that the corresponding extremity of the radius turns. But when the movements of rotation of the forearm do not exist, the inferior extremity of the ulna becomes functionally useless and disappears. As to its rÃ´le in the movements of the region of the wrist, that is nil, for we may remember--we will observe it again when we come to treat of the articulations--that the hand articulates with the radius alone (radio-carpal articulation); this is the reason that, when the forearm possesses the fullest mobility, the hand follows the movements which that bone makes around the ulna. [Illustration: FIG. 27.--SUPERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE FOREARM OF THE HORSE: LEFT LIMB, SUPERIOR SURFACE. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, olecranon process; 4, coronoid process.] It is not so with the articulation at the elbow-joint; there it is the ulna, which, with the humerus, forms the essential parts (humero-ulnar articulation); its olecranon process limits the movement of extension of the forearm. It is for this reason that, even in those quadrupeds in which the ulna is atrophied, the olecranon process presents a relatively considerable degree of development. [Illustration: FIG. 28.--INFERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE FOREARM OF A MAN: LEFT SIDE, POSTERIOR SURFACE, POSITION OF SUPINATION. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; A, groove for the long abductor and short extensor muscles of the thumb; B, groove for the radial muscles; C, groove for the long extensor of the thumb; D, groove for the special extensor of the index finger and of the common extensor of the fingers; E, groove for the proper extensor of the little finger; F, groove for the posterior ulna.] [Illustration: FIG. 29.--INFERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE FOREARM OF THE DOG: LEFT SIDE, ANTERIOR SURFACE, NORMAL POSITION--THAT IS, THE POSITION OF PRONATION. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; A, groove for the long abductor and for the short extensor of the thumb; B, groove for the radials; D, groove for the long extensor of the thumb, the special extensor of the index-finger, and the common extensor of the fingers; E, groove for the special extensor of the little finger.] We know that on the posterior surface of the inferior extremity of the bones of the human forearm are grooves in which pass the tendons of the posterior and external muscles which, belonging to this region, are directed for insertion towards the hand. In animals, because of the movement of rotation of the radius, the surface of this bone, which is anterior, corresponds to the posterior surface of the same in man. (To possess a clear conception of this, it is necessary to remember that, in this latter, the bones of the forearm are always described as in the position of supination; they are thus represented in Fig. 28. The direction of the surfaces of the radius is the reverse of that in animals, since the latter have the radius always in a state of pronation.) Consequently it is on the anterior surface of the bone that we find the grooves concerning which it is necessary to give some details. Regarding them in passing from the radius towards the ulna, those grooves give passage to the tendons of the muscles whose names occupy the columns on p. 43. The letters which are referred to each serve to define their order, and to facilitate reference to Figs. 28, 29, and 30. [Illustration: FIG. 30.--INFERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONE OF THE FOREARM OF THE HORSE: LEFT SIDE, ANTERIOR SURFACE. 1, Radius; A, groove for the long abductor and the short extensor of the thumb; B, groove for the radials; D, groove for the common extensor of the digits; E, groove for the special extensor of the little finger.] We should mention that the groove E is situated, both in man and in the dog, at the level of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation; but that in the horse, as the ulna does not exist at that level, the groove is situated on the external surface of the inferior extremity of the radius. It is necessary to add that, in some horses, the ulna is, nevertheless, represented in this region by a tongue-like process of bone; and in such cases the groove is situated in front of this process, at the level of the line of coalescence, which there represents the articulation. -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------- MAN. | DOG. | HORSE. -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------- A.

It is also useful to note, with reference to the groove F, in which passes, in man, the tendon of the posterior ulnar muscle, that, when the forearm is in pronation, the radius alone being displaced, we can only see this groove on the surface which looks backwards; and that it is then separated from the groove which contains the tendon of the special extensor of the little finger by an interval equal to the thickness of the head of the ulna.[12] When the forearm is supinated, the two grooves are found, on the other hand, one beside the other: and the tendons which they contain are very naturally in contact. [12] Ãdouard Cuyer, 'Shape of the Region of the Wrist in Supination and Pronation' (_Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© d'Anthropologie_, Paris, 1888). In birds the forearm is flexed on the arm, and the latter being directed downwards and backwards, the former is, consequently, directed upwards and forwards. Further, because of the position of the humerus, which, as we mentioned on p. 32, has its inferior extremity so turned that the surface which is anterior in man becomes external, the radius, instead of being outside the ulna, is placed above it. This latter is larger than the radius, but its olecranon process is very slightly developed. The Hand The hand in animals, as in man, is formed of three parts--the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers. In man, the forearm and the hand being described in the position of supination; the bones of the carpus are named in passing from the most external to the most internal--that is to say, from that which corresponds to the radial side of the forearm to that which corresponds to the ulnar side. In animals in which, as we know, but it is not unprofitable to repeat, the hand is in pronation, the radial side of the forearm being placed inside, we enumerate the carpal bones in counting the most internal as the first; this is the only method which permits us, in taking our point of departure from the human skeleton as our standard, to recognise the homologies of the bones of the carpal region. These bones, eight in number, are arranged in two transverse rows, of which one, the first, is superior or antibrachial; the other, the second, is inferior or metacarpal. Each of these rows contains four bones. Considered in the order we have indicated above--that is to say, proceeding from the radial to the ulnar side--they are thus named: scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform, in the first row; trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform, in the second. The number of these bones is not the same in all animals on account of the coalescence or absence of some. In each row the bones are placed side by side, with the exception of the pisiform, which being placed on the palmar surface of the cuneiform, produces a small projection in man, but a very pronounced one in quadrupeds. The pisiform is called the _hooked bone_ in some veterinary anatomies. If we consider the hook which it forms, we may recognise that the name is appropriate; but from the point of view of comparison with the human carpus, the name is unfortunate, for it creates confusion between the true pisiform (the fourth bone in the upper row), and the last bone in the lower row, which is the veritable unciform bone. We do not here seek for similarity of form, but homology of regions; and it is only by using the same names to denote the same things that we can succeed in determining such homology. Taken as a whole, the bones of the carpus form a mass which, by its superior border, articulates with the bones of the forearm, and by its inferior border is in relation with the metacarpal region. Its dorsal surface (anterior in quadrupeds) is slightly convex; its palmar surface (posterior in quadrupeds) is excavated, and forms a groove in which pass the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. This last, in man, has the appearance of a gutter, because of the prominences caused by the projection of the internal and external bones beyond their fellows. In quadrupeds the palmar groove is especially determined by the pisiform bone, of which we have just mentioned the great development. The region occupied by the carpus, in the unguligrades, is known as the _knee_; it would have been more appropriately named had it been called the _wrist_. The number of the metacarpal bones in mammals never exceeds five, but it often falls below it; the same is true for the digits. The first are generally equal in number to the latter; an exception is met with in ruminants, whose two metacarpals coalescing soon after birth, form but one bone; this, the _canon_ bone, articulates with two digits. The number of metacarpals and digits diminishes in proportion as the limbs cease to be organs of prehension, and become more exclusively organs of support and locomotion. The number of phalanges is two for the thumb and three for each of the other digits; except in the cetaceans, in which they are more numerous. In the bat, the metacarpals and phalanges are very long, and form the skeleton of the wing; these phalanges are not furnished with nails; the thumb, which is very short, is alone provided with one (Fig. 8). With regard to the relative dimensions of the bones of the metacarpus, it is necessary to remember that, in the human being, the second metacarpal is the longest; then, in the order of decrease, come the third, fourth, fifth, and first. In quadrupeds we shall also find differences in length (see the chapter relating to the anterior limbs in certain animals), but the order of decrease is not always that which we have just mentioned. In man the articular surface, situated at the inferior extremity of each of the metacarpals, is rounded, and is called the head. This allows the first phalanx, which is in relation with that surface, to be displaced in every direction; indeed, this phalanx can not only be flexed and extended, but it can also be moved laterally; this latter movement allows of the fingers being separated and drawn together. In quadrupeds which can only perform the movements of flexion and extension of the digits--for example, the horse--the inferior extremity of the metacarpal has not a rounded head of a regular outline; it is marked by a prominent median crest, directed from before backwards, so that the articular surfaces, which fit more exactly, form a sort of hinge which allows of backward and forward movements only, and permits no lateral displacement. In man, at the level of the inferior extremity of the first metacarpal, in the vicinity of the articulation of this bone with the first phalanx of the thumb, we find two sesamoid bones--small bones developed in the fibrous tissue which surrounds the articulation. We also meet with such structures, but more rarely, at the level of the corresponding articulation of the index and auricular digits; and, more rarely still, at those of the middle and ring fingers. In quadrupeds, these bones are normally developed, and we shall see afterwards that in some animals, as they reach a considerable size, they are able to influence the external outlines; we shall see this, for example, in the horse. The hand, in birds, is directed obliquely downwards and backwards (Fig. 31). For the better understanding of its position in relation to the forearm, we should remember that this latter, as we have described (p. 44), directed obliquely upwards and forwards, has the radius placed above the ulna; the hand being oblique in the opposite direction and placed under the forearm is, by this arrangement, inclined towards the ulnar border of the latter. [Illustration: FIG. 31.--SKELETON OF THE SUPERIOR LIMB OF A BIRD (VULTURE): LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Humerus; 2, radius; 3, ulna; 4, radial bone of the carpus; 5, ulnar bone of the carpus; 6, first metacarpal; 7, second metacarpal; 8, third metacarpal; 9, first digit, the homologue of the thumb; 10, first phalanx of the second digit; 11, second phalanx of the second digit; 12, third digit.] For the rest, in order to be able to distinguish readily the corresponding parts in the hand of a bird and that of a man, we merely have to place the human forearm obliquely, in a direction upwards and forwards (Fig. 32), the radius being above; this position we can obtain by semi-pronation; then, to incline strongly the hand downwards and backwards, moving the ulnar border of the hand towards the ulna; the thumb is then anterior, the little finger posterior, and the palm of the hand is turned towards the trunk. The carpus in birds is formed by two bones only, with which the skeleton of the forearm articulates. That which is in contact with the radius is called the _radial bone of the carpus_; and that with which the ulna articulates is named the _ulnar bone_. [Illustration: FIG. 32.--SUPERIOR LIMB OF THE HUMAN BEING, THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS BEING PLACED IN THE ATTITUDE WHICH THE CORRESPONDING PARTS OCCUPY IN BIRDS: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.] The metacarpus is formed of three bones; the first, which is very short, is fused at its superior extremity with the adjoining one; this latter and the third, both longer than the first, but of unequal size, are fused at their extremities. The metacarpal, which articulates with the radial bone of the carpus, is larger than the one which is in line with the ulna. To the metacarpus succeed three digits, of which the central is the longest, and is formed of two phalanges; the other two are formed each by a small, stylet-shaped bone. The middle finger, situated on the prolongation of the metacarpal, which articulates with the radial bone of the carpus, has its first phalanx large and flattened transversely; this phalanx seems to have been formed by the union of two bones of unequal development; the second phalanx is styloid in form. As to the other two fingers, they are placed, one in front and the other behind; the first, which articulates with the short metacarpal, fused at its upper end with the principal bone of the metacarpus, in position represents the thumb. The other, which is the third finger, articulates with the inferior extremity of the thinnest bone of the metacarpus; it is sometimes closely united to the corresponding border of the first phalanx of the large--that is to say, of the median--digit. The Anterior Limbs in Certain Animals =Plantigrades=: =Bear= (Fig. 33).--The scapula of the bear approaches in shape to a trapezium, of which the angles have been rounded off. The anterior border (cervical) is strongly convex in the part next the glenoid cavity. The junction of the superior (spinal) and the cervical border forms almost a right angle, the summit of which corresponds to the origin of the spine. At its posterior angle there is a prominence, directed downwards, the surface of which is hollowed and is separated from the infraspinous fossa by a crest, so that at this level a third fossa is added to the infraspinous one. The neck of the scapula is but slightly marked. The acromion is prominent, and projects a little beyond the glenoid cavity. The clavicle is rudimentary, but, as an example of the complete development of this bone in plantigrade quadrupeds, we may cite the marmoset. The humerus is furnished at its superior extremity with a large tuberosity, wide, and situated in front of the head of the bone; the effect of this is that the bicipital groove is internal. As in man, the great tuberosity does not reach so high as the humeral head, but it approaches more nearly to that level. The deltoid impression is very extensive, and descends pretty far down on the body of the bone. The epitrochlea is prominent; the epicondyle is surmounted by a well-marked crest, curved and flexuous in outline. [Illustration: FIG. 33.--SKELETON OF THE BEAR: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE. 1. Cranium; 2, face; 3, atlas; 4, axis; 5, seventh cervical vertebra; 6, first dorsal vertebra; 7, fourteenth and last dorsal vertebra; 8, lumbar vertebrÃ¦; 9, sacrum; 10, coccygeal vertebrÃ¦; 11, sternum; 12, ninth and last sternal rib; 13, costal cartilages; 14, acromion process; 15, third fossa on the external surface of the scapula; 16, great tuberosity of the humerus; 17, musculo-spiral groove; 18, epicondyle; 19, radius; 20, ulna; 21, olecranon process; 22, carpus; 23, pisiform; 24, metacarpus; 25, phalanges; 26, ilium, external fossa; 27, pubis; 28, tuberosity of the ischium; 29, obturator foramen; 30, great trochanter of the femur; 31, condyles of the femur; 32, patella, or knee-cap; 33, anterior tuberosity of the tibia; 34, fibula; 35, tarsus; 36, calcaneum, or heel-bone; 37, metatarsus; 38, phalanges.] The articular surface, which is in contact with the radius, is not a regularly formed condyle; it is a little flattened on its anterior surface, and presents at this level a slight depression which corresponds to a small eminence on the anterior aspect of the superior extremity of the radius. The surface which articulates with the ulna, viewed on its anterior aspect, has the shape of a slightly-marked trochlea; except at the level of the internal lip, which, as in man, descends lower than the surface for articulation with the radius (condyle). Behind, the trochlea is more clearly defined. The bear possesses a considerable power of rotation of the radius; the bones of the forearm are joined only at their extremities, while in the remainder of their extent they are widely separated. The ulna terminates below in a head and a styloid process; these articulate with the two last bones of the first row of the carpus--viz., the cuneiform and pisiform. The bones of the carpus are seven in number, the scaphoid and the semilunar being fused together. The metacarpals, five in number, differ very little from one another in regard to length, though they increase in size from the first to the fifth; this may be demonstrated by looking at the palmar surface of the hand. It is the reverse of that which we find in man, for the fifth metacarpal is the thickest of all, and the first is the most slender. At the level of each metacarpo-phalangeal articulation are two sesamoid bones. The third digit is the longest. The terminal phalanges present two very different portions: one, the anterior, is curved and pointed; it serves to support the nail, whose shape it assumes; the other, posterior, forms a sort of sheath into which the base of the nail is received. The inferior portion of the posterior surface of this latter part articulates with the second phalanx in the case of each of the last four digits, but with the first phalanx in the case of the thumb.

The supraspinous and infraspinous fossÃ¦ are of equal extent (Figs. 35 and 36). The neck is short. The spine of the scapula becomes more and more prominent towards its inferior extremity, where it ends in a twisted and inflexed portion, which represents the acromion process; this process terminates at the level of the glenoid cavity. The coracoid process is represented by a small tubercle, slightly curved inwards; this tubercle is situated above the glenoid cavity, at the inferior part of the cervical border. In the dog, the posterior angle, formed by the junction of the axillary and the superior (spinal) borders, is obtuse; the spine rises perpendicularly from the surface of the bone. The width of the scapula, measured at the level of the spinal border (from A to AÂ´, Fig. 35), equals about half the length of the spine. We must, however, make an exception for the turnspit dog, in which the superior border equals three-fourths of that length. The scapula is, in this case, of a more compact type; it is broader, but shorter. In the cat, the anterior outline of the scapula, formed by the union of the cervical border and the corresponding half of the spinal, is more convex; the posterior angle is not obtuse, as in the dog. The spine is bent slightly downwards and backwards; before terminating in the acromion process it presents a triangular projection, the apex of which is directed downwards. The tubercle which represents the coracoid process is curved inwards more strongly than that of the dog, thus resembling more closely the appearance of this process in the human being. All proportions considered, the scapula of the cat is broader than that of the dog; its width, measured along the length of its spinal border (from A to AÂ´, Fig. 36), equals three-fourths of the length of the spine. The clavicle is rudimentary; it is, however, better developed in the cat than in the dog. The clavicle of the cat is represented by a small, elongated bone, curved in outline, the convexity being turned forward; it is united to the acromion and the sternum by ligamentous fibres; that of the dog is merely a scale-like osseous plate situated on the posterior surface of a muscle of this region (see Figs. 16 and 17). The humerus is long and twisted in the shape of an S. The inferior articular surface has the form of a simple pulley, for the condyle is very slightly marked. The internal part of this articular surface descends lower than the external; this condition resembles that found in the human being, where the inner lip of the trochlea is lower than the condyle. In the dog, the olecranon fossa communicates with the coronoid by an opening. In the cat, there is a supra-epitrochlear canal (see Fig. 19), but no olecranon perforation. The bones of the forearm articulate at their extremities. The body of the radius is united to the body of the ulna by a short, thick, interosseous ligament; the fibres of this ligament, though short, do not prevent the production of some movements at the articulations of the bones. The radius so crosses the ulna that above, it is in front and external to the latter, while below, it is internal. This bone is flattened from front to back, and slightly convex anteriorly. Its superior extremity is formed, externally, of a portion which represents the head of the radius in man; internally, by another portion which represents half of the coronoid process of the ulna, which, in the human being, belongs exclusively to the latter (see p. 39, the encroachment of the radius on the ulna). This extremity is surrounded with a vertical articular surface which is placed in contact with a small cavity which is hollowed out on the ulna (the lesser sigmoid cavity); and presents at its superior aspect a surface which articulates with the inferior extremity of the humerus. The shaft of the bone has on its internal border rugosities analogous to the imprint of the pronator radii teres of the human skeleton; these rugosities, indeed, give insertion to a muscle of the same function, and bearing the same name. The inferior extremity, broader than the superior, is hollowed on its external aspect by a small cavity which receives the inferior extremity of the ulna; its inferior surface (concave) articulates with the carpus; its anterior surface (the homologue of the posterior surface of the corresponding extremity of the human radius) presents grooves which serve for the passage of the tendons of the muscles which pass from the forearm to the back of the hand. (For the names of the muscles whose tendons pass in these grooves, see Fig. 29.) The ulna is furnished at its superior extremity with an olecranon process, which is more prominent than that of the human ulna; this process is compressed laterally, and its internal surface is hollowed; there we also find a great sigmoid cavity, and a coronoid process situated at the internal part of the anterior surface, a process which, as we have previously shown, it shares with the radius. The shaft of the bone, prismatic and triangular, diminishes in thickness as it approaches the lower extremity, which articulates with the corresponding extremity of the radius. In the dog, the ulna terminates inferiorly in a blunt point, without enlargement, analogous to the head of the human ulna; in the cat, by a head which is prolonged into a styloid process, by which it articulates with a portion of the carpus. The carpus consists of seven bones--three in the superior row and four in the inferior. In the superior row the scaphoid and semilunar bones are fused together. The pisiform is elongated and expanded at its two extremities; it forms a prominence which, directed backwards, projects beyond the level of the other bones of this region. The metacarpal bones are five in number; they are enumerated from within outwards; they articulate with the carpus and with each other. The inferior extremity of each metacarpal bone presents the form of a condyle in front; and is divided behind so as to form two lateral condyles, which are separated by a median crest; on these posterior condyles are applied two small sesamoid bones. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is very short; the third and fourth are the longest. The metacarpus, as a whole, is directed vertically. The phalanges are three in number for each finger, except the thumb, which has but two. The first phalanx, directed almost horizontally forwards, is the longest; the second is directed downwards and forwards; the third consists of two portions: a posterior part, which forms a sort of sheath into which the base of the nail is received; and an anterior, conical in form, and curved in crochet shape, which forms a support for the nail (Fig. 37). The third and fourth digits are the longest; the second and fifth are of equal length; the thumb is the shortest; it does not touch the ground, and does not even reach the articulation of the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of the second finger. In the cat, the metacarpal bone of the thumb, although shorter than any of the others, is quite as thick. The third digit is a little longer than either the second or fourth. In animals of this genus, the claws, in the condition of repose, are retracted, and removed from the ground; this prevents their being worn, and thus preserves their sharpness. At such times the third phalanx is received into a groove which is found on the external surface of the second phalanx. In the dog, the claws are not tractile. [Illustration: FIG. 37.--SKELETON OF THE FINGER OF A FELIDE (LION): LEFT SIDE, INTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Metacarpus; 2, sesamoid bones; 3, first phalanx; 4, second phalanx; 5, third phalanx; 6, gutter for the reception of the base of the nail; 7, prominent osseous crest formed to lodge in the concavity of the nail.] [Illustration: FIG. 38.--SKELETON OF THE PIG: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE. 1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, atlas; 4, axis; 5, seventh cervical vertebra; 6, first dorsal vertebra; 7, fourteenth and last dorsal vertebra; 8, lumbar vertebrÃ¦; 9, sacrum; 10, coccygeal vertebrÃ¦; 11, anterior extremity of the sternum; 12, xiphoid appendix; 13, seventh and last sternal rib; 14, costal cartilage; 15, cartilage of prolongation of the scapula; 16, great tuberosity of the humerus; 17, olecranon process; 18, radius; 19, ulna; 20, pisiform; 21, metacarpus; 22, phalanges of the two great toes; 23, phalanges of the external toe; 24, ilium; 25, pubis; 26, tuberosity of the ischium; 27, great trochanter; 28, knee-cap; 29, anterior tuberosity of the tibia; 30, fibula; 31, tarsus; 32, calcaneum; 33, metatarsus; 34, phalanges of the two great toes; 35, phalanges of the external toe.] =Unguligrades=: =Pig= (Fig. 38).--The scapula is markedly narrowed in the region above the glenoid cavity. The spine is atrophied at both its extremities, so that at its inferior part we do not find the acromion process. In its middle portion the spine is prominent, and presents a triangular process which turns backwards, overlapping a part of the infraspinous fossa; this latter is much larger than the supraspinous. The spinal border is surmounted by the cartilage of prolongation, the superior margin of which is convex; this cartilage extends posteriorly beyond the posterior (axillary) border of the bone. The small tuberosity of the superior extremity of the humerus is but slightly developed; the great tuberosity, on the contrary, is very large. The bicipital groove is situated internal to this. The deltoid impression is scarcely marked. The forearm is short, directed obliquely downwards and inwards, thus forming with the hand an angle, of which the apex is directed inwards. The two bones of the forearm are strongly bound to one another by an interosseous ligament, which is formed of very short fibres. The radius appropriates, at its superior extremity, the coronoid process of the ulna. The latter is, notwithstanding, well developed in the rest of its extent; it has a flattened shaft which almost completely overlaps the posterior surface of the radius; its inferior extremity reaches to the carpus. The carpus is formed of eight bones--four in the superior row, and four in the inferior. The third bone of the superior row (cuneiform) is more in contact with the ulna than with the radius. There are but four metacarpal bones; there is no metacarpal of the thumb. The two median metacarpal bones are the longest; they are those which correspond to the digits which alone touch the ground. The internal digit and the external one are thin and short; they are functionless, as a rule, taking no part in supporting the limbs on the ground. Notwithstanding this, they are formed, as the other digits, of a number of phalanges, which give them the semblance of perfect digits. (We shall soon see that in certain animals there exist digits which, being incomplete with regard to the numbers of their constituent bones, more accurately merit the name of imperfect digits.) The third phalanges are each enclosed in a horny hoof, to which the name of _onglon_ has been given. We have already drawn attention to the smaller lateral digits, and noted the general fact that they do not come in contact with the ground. It is necessary to modify this statement by adding that under certain conditions they give a slight amount of support; for example, when the individual is the subject of excessive obesity, the limbs yield under the weight, and the nails of the lateral digits may touch the ground. A similar fact may be noticed in pigs of ordinary bulk at the moment when, during walking, each of the fore-limbs commences to bear the weight--that is to say, when it is directed obliquely downwards and forwards; then all the digits are in contact with the ground. =Unguligrades (Ungulates)=: =Sheep=, =Ox= (Fig. 39).--The scapula, which is of elongated form, is very narrow in the vicinity of the glenoid cavity. The spine, which becomes more and more salient towards its inferior part, terminates abruptly in a border, which, forming an acute angle with the crest, produces a projection which represents the acromion process--a very rudimentary acromion, for it does not reach the level of the glenoid cavity. The supraspinous fossa is much smaller than the infraspinous; it hardly equals one-third the extent of the latter. The anterior border, thin and convex in its superior portion, is concave in the rest of its extent; the posterior border is thick and slightly concave; the spinal border is surmounted by the cartilage of prolongation. In the ox the spine of the scapula, in its middle portion, is flexed a little backwards on the infraspinous fossa. [Illustration: FIG. 39.--SKELETON OF THE OX: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE. 1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, atlas; 4, axis; 5, seventh cervical vertebra; 6, first dorsal vertebra; 7, thirteenth and last dorsal vertebra; 8, lumbar vertebrÃ¦; 9, sacrum; 10, coccygeal vertebrÃ¦; 11, sternum; 12, xiphoid appendix; 13, eighth and last sternal rib; 14, costal cartilages; 15, spine of scapula; 16, cartilage of prolongation of the scapula; 17, great tuberosity of the humerus; 18, musculo-spiral groove; 19, olecranon process; 20, radius; 21, carpus; 22, pisiform; 23, metacarpus; 24, rudimentary metacarpal; 25, sesamoid bones; 26, first phalanges; 27, second phalanges; 28, third phalanges; 29, anterior iliac spine; 30, pubis; 31, tuberosity of the ischium; 32, great trochanter; 33, supracondyloid fossa of the femur; 34, patella, or knee-cap; 35, anterior tuberosity of the tibia; 36, fibula; 37, coronoid tarsal bone; 38, tarsus; 39, calcaneum; 40, metatarsus; 41, rudimentary metatarsus; 42, sesamoid bones; 43, first phalanges; 44, second phalanges; 45, third phalanges.] The great tuberosity of the humerus is highly developed; its summit, very prominent, is flexed over the bicipital groove; a prominence of the small tuberosity also bends over the groove, with the result that at this level the latter is converted into a sort of canal. At the inferior extremity the condyle, although not large, is recognisable; for it is separated from the trochlea by a depression in form of a groove. In contrast to the condition found in man, the condyle descends to a level a little below that of the internal lip of the trochlea. (For the arrangement of the epicondyle and the epitrochlea, see p. 30.) In the sheep, the deltoid impression is but slightly marked; in the ox, it is more evident. The forearm is directed obliquely downwards and inwards, so as to form, with the hand, an angle of which the apex is internal; this angular outline of the _knee_ (wrist) is so characteristic of ruminants that the corresponding region of the horse, when salient inwards, receives the name of _ox-knee_. The radius bears the coronoid process, and the larger part of the articular surface which comes in contact with the inferior extremity of the humerus; the condyle and the trochlea articulate with the radius in front; while behind, the trochlea articulates with that part of the sigmoid cavity which belongs to the ulna. The posterior surface of the shaft of the radius is flattened; its anterior surface is slightly convex. The inferior extremity articulates with the carpus by a surface which is directed obliquely downwards and inwards. The shaft of the ulna is very slender, and fused in its middle third with the body of the radius; it terminates below, at the level of the external part of the inferior extremity of the radius, by a slightly expanded portion which, fused with this latter, forms the articular surface for the carpal bones. In the ox the forearm is short; in the sheep it is proportionally longer. The bones of the carpus are six in number--four in the upper row, and two in the lower; they form an irregular cuboid mass which contributes to the formation of the region known as _the knee_ in ruminants, as in the horse; we have already remarked that the name 'wrist' would be more accurate. The anterior surface in its foremost part is vertical, and is slightly convex from side to side. At its posterior and external part the pisiform bone forms a prominence. The metacarpus consists of two bones only--one, well developed, which is known as the principal metacarpal, or the _canon_ bone (this is the name given to the region in the hoofed animals); and a rudimentary one, which is situated at the superior and external aspect of the preceding metacarpal. Sometimes there is found a third metacarpal at the internal aspect; but, when present, it is but very slightly developed. The principal metacarpal consists of two metacarpals fused together; on this account the bone is longitudinally marked in the median line by a slight depression which marks the junction of the two bones of which it is formed. In some ruminants (certain species of chevrotains) the coalescence does not take place, and the two metacarpals remain separate. The anterior surface of the principal metacarpal is convex transversely; its posterior surface is flattened. The superior extremity of this bone articulates by two facets with the two bones of the inferior row of the carpus; on the internal part of the anterior surface of this extremity is found a tubercle. The inferior extremity is divided into two parts by a fissure or notch; each part is articular, and consists of two separate condyles, which are separated from each other by an antero-posterior crest; on each side of this crest, and behind, are found two sesamoid bones. As for the external rudimentary metacarpal bone, it is nothing more than a small, short tongue of bone; which, in goats and sheep, is often absent. The division of the inferior extremity of the principal metacarpal into two parts is correlated with the two perfect digits which give the foot of the ruminant its forked appearance. Each digit consists of three phalanges, which are directed obliquely downwards and forwards; further, these phalanges are inclined a little outwards from the axis of the limb, so that the two digits diverge from each other as they descend. The first phalanx, which is the longest, articulates superiorly with the principal metacarpal; its inferior extremity terminates in a trochlea, and the lip of this, which is situated towards the axis of the limb, descends lower than that of the opposite side; this arrangement is correlated with the divergent direction of the digits. The second phalanx has its superior extremity moulded on the trochlea which terminates the extremity of the first; its inferior extremity is articular, and elongated from before backwards. On the posterior surface of this extremity is found a sesamoid bone. With regard to the third phalanx, it presents the form of a triangular pyramid, and displays a postero-superior concave surface with which the second phalanx articulates; an anterior, convex surface, which terminates in a point on its anterior part; and an internal surface, which is flattened. The third phalanx of each digit is contained in a hoof (_onglon_). There is also found in ruminants two imperfect rudimentary digits, which are represented by two small bones situated behind the articulation of the metacarpal and the digits which we have just been studying. These rudimentary digits are each enveloped in a layer of horn; they constitute the _spurs_. The two digits of the ruminants represent the third and fourth fingers of the human hand; the two lateral digits, greatly atrophied, are the homologues of the second and fifth fingers; the thumb is not present. It is the same as regards the metacarpal bones, which form, by their union, the principal metacarpal; the external represents the fourth metacarpal, and the internal the third. It is to the latter that the tubercle, of which we have already made mention, belongs; and with the signification of which, because it gives attachment to a muscle, we shall concern ourselves in the section on myology (see Radial Muscles). =Unguligrades=: =Horse= (Fig. 40).--The scapula is narrow, compared with that of the animals we have just been considering. The anterior border is convex in its superior portion, and concave in its inferior; the posterior border is slightly hollowed out. The supraspinous fossa is less in extent than the infraspinous; but the difference is less than that between the same fossÃ¦ in the ox and the sheep; in the ox, as we have already indicated, the proportion is one-third; in the horse, one-half. The spine, which disappears at the extremities, is rough and thick in its middle third, there forming a kind of tuberosity--_tuberosity of the spine_. Above and in front of the glenoid cavity is found a strong process consisting of a rugous base, and a summit which is directed inwards. This forms a kind of hook curved towards the inside; it represents the coracoid process. The scapula is surmounted by the cartilage of prolongation, of which the superior border, which is thin and curved, is parallel to the superior border of the prominence of the withers; the cartilage forms, consequently, the lateral surface of this region. The cartilage of prolongation undergoes ossification in old horses. The humerus is short; the bicipital groove, situated on the anterior surface of the superior extremity, separates the greater tuberosity from the lesser, and is divided into two parts by a median ridge; it is this portion of the humerus which forms the prominence known as the _point of the shoulder_, or _point of the arm_. The deltoid impression well deserves the name of tuberosity which has been given to it, for it is very prominent; the musculo-spiral groove is very deep. [Illustration: FIG. 40.--SKELETON OF THE HORSE: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE. 1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, atlas; 4, axis; 5, seventh cervical vertebra; 6, first dorsal vertebra; 7, eighteenth and last dorsal vertebra; 8, lumbar vertebrÃ¦; 9, sacrum; 10, coccygeal vertebrÃ¦; 11, sternum; 12, xiphoid appendix; 13, eighteenth and last sternal rib; 14, costal cartilage; 15, scapula; 16, cartilage of extension; 17, great tuberosity of the humerus; 18, deltoid crest; 19, olecranon process; 20, radius; 21, carpus; 22, pisiform; 23, principal metacarpal; 24, metacarpal, external rudimentary; 25, large sesamoids; 26, first phalanx; 27, second phalanx; 28, third phalanx; 29, ilium, showing external iliac fossa; 30, pubis; 31, tuberosity of the ischium; 32, great trochanter; 33, infratrochanteric crest, or third trochanter; 34, supracondyloid fossa of the femur; 35, knee-cap; 36, anterior tuberosity of the tibia; 37, the fibula; 38, tarsus astragalus; 39, calcaneum; 40, principal metatarsal; 41, rudimentary external metatarsal; 42, large sesamoids; 43, first phalanx; 44, second phalanx; 45, third phalanx. _To face p. 64._] At the inferior extremity, the trochlea is large; the portion corresponding to the condyle of the humerus in man is, in proportion to the latter, of small extent. The olecranon fossa is deep. The epicondyle and the epitrochlea are somewhat different from those of the human bone. In the latter, the epitrochlea is salient towards the inner side, causing an increased transverse diameter of the inferior extremity of the humerus. In the horse--it is the same in ruminants--this tuberosity projects backwards, folds on itself in forming the internal boundary of the olecranon cavity, and exceeds in diameter, in the antero-posterior direction, the prominence of the epicondyle, which presents a nearly similar arrangement. This latter has, however, a part which, projecting externally, is situated at the inferior part of a crest, that forms the posterior boundary of the musculo-spiral groove. The result is that, contrary to the condition found in the human being, the epicondyle is more prominent transversely than the epitrochlea, but this latter is more salient on the posterior aspect. The epitrochlea and the epicondyle offer a larger surface for the origin of muscles of the forearm than the same prominences in the human bone do for the analogous muscles of the same region. Some veterinary anatomists have given to the inferior and external articular surface of the humerus the name of trochlea; and to the internal one, that of condyle. On this account they designate the external prominence as the epitrochlea, and the internal one as the epicondyle. In addition to the fact that this point of view is not legitimate, it produces inevitable confusion when comparing the parts with those of the human humerus, and this confusion exists, not alone in describing the bone, but also in the description of the muscular attachments, and in the comparison of the muscles of the forearm of quadrupeds with the corresponding muscles in the human species. The radius is placed in front of the ulna; its body, slightly convex forwards, has the anterior surface convex transversely, and the posterior surface plane in the same direction. It is to the external part of this latter that the ulna is applied, which is completely fused with the radius. The superior extremity of the radius is a little larger than the inferior. Its superior aspect, concavo-convex, moulded on the inferior articular surface of the humerus, presents internally two cavities, which receive the lips of the trochlea, and, externally, another, smaller, cavity, which receives the condyle. The radius articulates with the trochlea and the condyle, having appropriated a portion of the ulna, as is proved by the presence of the coronoid process, which belongs to the former. This superior extremity presents, internally, a tuberosity into which the biceps is inserted; this is the bicipital tuberosity; and on the other side is another tuberosity, which is a little more prominent than the preceding. The inferior extremity, which is flattened from before backwards, is furrowed on its anterior surface by grooves for the passage of muscles (the names of the muscles whose tendons pass in these grooves have already been given on p. 43). It articulates at the lower end with the superior row of the carpus, and it terminates laterally in tuberosities: one, external, on which is found a groove for the tendon of the lateral extensor of the phalanges, the homologue of the special extensor of the little finger; the other, internal, is a little more prominent than the one we have just described. These tuberosities are visible under the skin which covers the superior and lateral parts of the region known as the _knee_; but which, we again repeat, is no other than the wrist. The ulna has a triangular shaft, situated at the posterior surface of the radius, with which it is fused. It disappears completely at the level of the inferior third of the forearm. Occasionally, in some horses, the ulna is abnormally long, in the form of a slender tongue of bone; and extends to the neighbourhood of the external tuberosity of the inferior extremity of the radius (see Fig. 79, p. 196). Its superior extremity is chiefly represented by the olecranon process, which is voluminous in bulk, and forms the projection known as the point of the elbow. This process is flattened laterally; its internal surface is excavated; the anterior surface, which is concave, forms a part of the great sigmoid cavity; the remainder of the cavity is formed by the radius. In the ass, the ulna is a little longer than in the horse--that is to say, it descends lower; and the radius is a little more convex anteriorly. The carpal bones are seven in number--four in the superior row, and three in the inferior. The trapezium is wanting in the latter. Sometimes, however, in certain varieties of horses the trapezium is developed, but then it is no more than a very small osseous nodule. The pisiform bone, situated at the external part of the first row of bone, is prominent posteriorly. It is of rounder form and flattened from without inwards. It articulates with the trapezium and the radius. It presents, on its external surface, a groove for the passage of the tendon of the posterior ulnar muscle, which is named by veterinary anatomists the _external flexor of the metacarpus_. The carpus, as a whole, is of an irregularly cuboid shape; its anterior surface, slightly convex from side to side, forms the skeleton of the region of the _knee_ (wrist). The metacarpus is formed of three bones: the principal metacarpal and the two rudimentary ones. The principal metacarpal, which forms the region of the _canon_, is directed vertically; its anterior surface is slightly convex transversely. This surface is covered by a number of tendons, which slightly alter its appearance; so that it is the principal base of this part of the fore-limb. Its posterior surface is flattened. The superior extremity of this metacarpal presents plane surfaces, variously inclined, with which the bones of the inferior row of the carpus articulate. On the anterior surface, and a little to the inner side, is found a tuberosity, which is destined for the insertion of _the anterior extensor of the metacarpus_, the homologue of the radial muscles. The inferior extremity is formed by two condyles, an internal and an external; between which is found a median crest. This extremity, the superior extremity of the first phalanx, which articulates with it, together with two sesamoid bones--the great sesamoids--which are situated on its posterior surface, collectively form the region which from its rounded outlines is called the _ball_. With regard to the rudimentary metacarpals, external and internal, to which some authors give the name of _fibulÃ¦_, they are applied to the sides of the posterior surface of the principal metacarpal. They are elongated bones, of which the superior extremity, which is a little thickened, is called the _head_; the lateral bones of the second row of the carpus partly rest on the heads of these. They become more slender as they descend, and terminate opposite the inferior fourth of the principal metacarpal. Each ends in a slight swelling, to which the name _button_ has been given. The internal one is the better developed. The rudimentary metacarpals are vestiges of atrophied digits, as will be explained further on. The single finger of the horse consists of three phalanges. The first phalanx, which is directed obliquely downwards and forwards, corresponds to the constricted region situated below the 'ball,' and known as the _pastern_. It is flattened from before backwards; its anterior surface is convex transversely, while the posterior surface is plane. Its superior extremity is moulded on the inferior extremity of the principal metacarpal, and its inferior extremity, which is smaller, presents a trochlea with which the second phalanx articulates. This is also directed downwards and forwards, and is shorter. It corresponds to the region which, situated between the pastern and the hoof, is known as the _cornet_. The third phalanx, situated entirely within the hoof, has the same direction as the first and second. It is large and broad, and presents three surfaces separated by well-marked angular borders (see Fig. 96). The anterior surface is oblique downwards and forwards; it is convex transversely. The inferior surface is slightly hollowed, and is in relation with the sole, or plantar surface of the hoof. The superior surface, which is articular, is divided by a median ridge into two lateral cavities, which correspond to the trochlea on the inferior surface of the lower extremity of the second phalanx. The inferior border corresponds in shape with the hoof. The superior border presents in its median part a projection, _the pyramidal eminence_, which prolongs at this level the anterior surface of the bone. Finally, the posterior border, which is concave, is in contact with a sesamoid bone, _the lesser sesamoid_, which increases the superior articular surface behind, and is also in contact with the second phalanx. As we have just seen, the horse possesses but one digit. In the ancestors of the animal--that is, in the prehistoric species which are now extinct (_orohippus_, _miohippus_, _protohippus_, or _hipparion_)--the number of digits was larger; this fact conclusively proves that the rudimentary metacarpals of the existing horse are vestiges of digits which have disappeared through want of use. In the first of those ancestors--orohippus--there were four digits; all save the first, the thumb, being then developed. In the others of the series there existed but three digits. It must, however, be noted that in those animals it is always the digit which corresponds to the middle finger of the pentedactyl hand that is longest. In other less ancient species the lateral fingers are reduced to the condition of mere splints of bone. It follows from what has been said that the digit which persists in the equine species should be considered as the third finger, and that the rudimentary metacarpals represent lateral digits considerably atrophied. This disappearance of the lateral digits cannot excite surprise when we consider the functions of the organs. Becoming useless, they must undergo gradual atrophy from want of use. There undoubtedly is, in this former existence of supplementary digits in the horse, something analogous to what we still find in the pig; where the two principal digits are accompanied by two shorter ones, which very probably, from their infrequent use, are destined to disappear in a more or less distant future. Proportions of the Arm, the Forearm, and the Metacarpus As a supplement to the study of the anterior limbs which we have just finished, it appears necessary to give some indications of the relative proportions of certain of the segments which form these limbs in the plantigrades, the digitigrades, and the ungulates. First, we would remark that, in following this order of classification, the scapula becomes less and less narrow, and assumes a form more and more elongated. In order to convince ourselves of this, it will be sufficient to study the bone first in man, then in the bear, the cat, dog, ox, and finally in the horse. As to the proportions of length, which are those we should chiefly study, we shall commence with the comparison of the forearm and arm--that is to say, the radius and the humerus. The radius is found to be longer in proportion to the humerus, as the number of digits is smaller, and the hand loses more and more the functions of an organ of prehension. In man, the radius is shorter than the humerus; in the horse, on the contrary, it is longer. To give an idea of this proportion, we shall employ what is known as the antibrachial index. This index gives the relation which exists between the length of the forearm and that of the humerus; the length of this latter, whatever may be the actual measurement, is represented by a fixed figure, the number 100. A very simple arithmetical operation gives the proportion-- forearm Ã 100 -------------, the quotient obtained furnishes the index. humerus The index is less than 100 if the forearm is shorter than the bone of the arm. The index is more than 100 if, on the contrary, the forearm is longer. In man, the radius is shorter than the humerus; indeed, in adult individuals of the white race the average index is 74. In the bear, the length of the radius approaches closely to that of the humerus; the index is about 90. In the skeleton of a bear in the anatomical museum of the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, the humerus is 33 centimetres in length, and the radius 30 centimetres. In the cat, the radius is very little shorter than the humerus. In the dog they are equal. The antibrachial index of the latter is, accordingly, 100. In the horse, the radius is longer than the humerus; the index is therefore above 100. Thus, in the skeleton of the horse which we have in the museum of the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, the index is 113--length of humerus, 29 centimetres; length of radius, 33 centimetres. In other skeletons which we have measured we found: in one, 108--humerus, 34 centimetres; radius, 37 centimetres; in another, 116--humerus, 25 centimetres; radius, 29 centimetres. The metacarpal bone undergoes, relatively to the humerus, a proportional elongation, analogous to that of the forearm. In man, the length of the metacarpus is contained about 5-1/2 times in that of the humerus; in the bear, it is contained 4 times; in the dog, 2-1/2 times; in the horse, 1-1/3 times only. It is well known that the proportions vary according to race, and that what we have here given are but the general indications. The Articulations of the Anterior Limbs The knowledge of human arthrology which we presume the reader to have previously acquired makes it unnecessary for us to enter into numerous details regarding the configuration of the articular osseous surfaces and the disposition of the fibrous bands that retain them in position. Accordingly, in the description which follows, and also in that of the articulations of the posterior limbs, we shall occupy ourselves but very briefly with the details above referred to, so as to devote ourselves especially to the indication of the movements--that is to say, of that which, while easily comprehended on recollection of former studies, presents the greatest interest from the artistic standpoint in these studies in comparative anatomy. =The Scapulo-Humeral Articulation.=--The head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula being in contact, the two bones are bound together by a rather loose articular capsule, which is strengthened by the muscles of this region which fulfil the function of active ligaments. This articulation, so movable in every direction in the human species, is not so much so in quadrupeds; the arm in the latter, as also the shoulder, being kept in contact with the lateral region of the thorax by the numerous muscles which surround it. Of the movements performed by the humerus, flexion and extension are the most extensive; those of abduction and adduction are much less so. It is necessary, before proceeding further, to determine what the two principal movements which we have just mentioned really are, viz., flexion and extension. We know that in man the displacements of the humerus which take place in the antero-posterior direction are known as movement or projection forwards, and movement or projection backwards, respectively. We do not say that the humerus is flexed or extended, because, in reality, on account of the position which the skeleton of the shoulder occupies, it is not able to flex or place itself on the line of prolongation of the scapula with which it articulates. In quadrupeds it is not so. The humerus and the scapula are contained in almost the same vertical plane; and the bone of the arm can take, in relation to the latter, the positions characteristic of flexion and extension--that is, of approach to the scapula and removal from it. What makes the meanings of these terms a little confusing is that, in human anatomy, some authors consider the backward movement of the humerus as extension, and the forward movement as flexion; in order to be able to compare these movements to those that the femur executes in relation to the pelvis. Now, in our opinion, the indication of this correspondence is not absolutely necessary; since it ceases to be exact if we wished, from the point of view of the direction given to other segments of the skeleton, to establish the same relation between the elbow and the articulation of the knee. It is therefore indispensable, when discussing quadrupeds, to discontinue these terms, in order the more readily to recognise that: in flexion the inferior extremity of the humerus is directed backwards; in extension, on the contrary, it is directed forwards. In the first case the humerus approaches the scapula; in the second, on the contrary, it moves away from it. These movements, which take place during walking, are executed in the following manner: When one of the anterior limbs is at the end of that stage of progression which is called support (see p. 289, Displacements of the Limbs)--that is to say, during the time that the foot remains in contact with the ground, whilst the trunk is moving forward--the direction of this limb becomes more and more oblique downwards and backwards. At a certain moment the limb is raised from the ground, to be carried forwards, in order to be again pressed on the ground, and recommence a new resting stage. In these different phases the humerus is flexed. But at the moment that the limb, when carried forwards, is about to resume its contact with the ground it becomes directed obliquely downwards and forwards; then the humerus is in the position of extension. During these movements of the humerus, there exists an essential factor--that is, the scapular balance. (It is the same as what occurs in man when he balances his arm in the antero-posterior plane.) When the humerus is flexed, the scapula moves in such a way that the superior portion projects forwards; when it is extended, the scapula, on the other hand, is inclined more backwards. But it is necessary to add that, during these displacements, the scapulo-humeral angle varies; it tends to close during the flexion of the humerus, and becomes more open during extension. The movements and the relations of the humerus and the scapula are clearly represented in Figs. 41 and 42, reproduced from the chromophotographic studies of Professor Marey--studies relative to the analyses of the movements of the horse.[13] They show clearly the movements of flexion and extension of the humerus, also the balancing of the scapula which accompanies the movements. [13] E. J. Marey, 'Analyses of the Movements of the Horse by the Chromophotograph' (_La Nature_, June 11, 1898). [Illustration: FIG. 41.--FLEXION OF THE HUMERUS: RIGHT ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE (AFTER A CHROMOPHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY BY PROFESSOR MAREY).] [Illustration: FIG. 42.--EXTENSION OF THE HUMERUS: RIGHT ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE (AFTER A CHROMOPHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY BY PROFESSOR MAREY).] =The Articulation of the Elbow, or the Humero-ulnar Articulation.=--In this articulation, which is constructed in the form of a true hinge, the movements of flexion and extension alone are possible. In flexion, the forearm, directed forwards, is folded on the arm, with which, in certain circumstances, it comes in contact. For example, in a horse of mettle which leaps over an elevated obstacle, the animal forcibly raises his fore-limbs by flexing them. Flexion is produced to the same extent, and even more so, and for a longer period, in felides which crouch. In extension, on the contrary, the forearm is carried backward. This movement being limited only by the contact of the tip of the olecranon with the bottom of the olecranon fossa of the humerus, the forearm is enabled, in this case, to move until it is in line with the arm. For example, during walking, when one of the anterior limbs, having reached the end of its resting stage, is considerably inclined downwards and backwards. The apex of the olecranon process--that is to say, the point of the elbow--forms a marked prominence, more salient in flexion than in extension, as in the corresponding region of the human elbow. =The Radio-ulnar Articulation.=--It is in the dog and the cat, in which the two bones of the forearm articulate by their extremities only, and remain separate in the rest of their extent, that the articulations call for special notice. In the upper part, the radius rotates on itself; while below, it rotates around the ulna. It follows that the forearm, which in all quadrupeds is in a state of permanent pronation, can, in carnivora, take the position of supination, or rather, of demi-supination. In fact, whatever be the mobility of the two bones of the forearm, the movement is not able to bring the palmar surface to the front, but only to direct it towards the median line. =The Articulation of the Wrist.=--Here are found, as in man, three superimposed articulations: the radio-carpal, intercarpal, and carpo-metacarpal. If we remember the movements which take place at the plane of these articulations in man, and take account of the fact that the mobility of the limbs is reduced just in proportion as they are simplified in structure so as to become organs of support only, we can easily comprehend that, in the horse and the ox, and, in a word, animals that have a canon bone, the movements of the wrist are little varied in character, while in carnivorÃ¦, on the other hand, they are relatively more so. We will remember that in the ox and the horse the region of the wrist is called the _knee_. In flexion, the hand is bent backwards; in extension it is carried forwards. These two movements take place especially in the radiocarpal and intercarpal articulations. In the first of these articulations, it is the superior row of the carpus which glides backwards and forwards on the corresponding articular surface of the forearm. In the second articulation, it is the second row which moves; gliding on the inferior articular surfaces of the row above it. This inferior row carries the metacarpus with it; for the carpo-metacarpal articulation is much less mobile than either of the other two. In flexion, the articular surfaces are separated from one another in front; and the changes of form which result from this are noticeable on the anterior surface of the 'knee.' Moreover, at that moment this region contrasts markedly in its outlines with the parts above it and below it--that is to say, with the corresponding surfaces of the forearm and of the canon bone. As for the lateral movements, by which the hand is inclined outwards and inwards in its movements at the wrist, they exist to an appreciable extent in the cat and the dog only; in order to understand this, it is enough to compare the shape of the articular surfaces of this region in carnivora and the horse, for example. In the latter, those surfaces are almost plane; in the cat, on the contrary, they are curved (inferior surface of the forearm, concave; superior border of the carpus, convex). These latter, then, are, in form, similar to those which exist at the same level in the human being; this explains the possibility of analogous movements of the whole hand--that is to say, of the movements of abduction and adduction. =The Metacarpo-phalangeal Articulations.=--With regard to the mobility, it is in these articulations, as in those of the wrist--that is to say, although in all quadrupeds the first phalanges can be flexed and extended on the metacarpus, it is only in the cat and dog that lateral movement is possible. Indeed, in the horse, in which the principal metacarpal terminates inferiorly in two convex surfaces, which are separated by a crest; and where the whole articulates with a cavity on the superior extremity of the first phalanx; because of the hinging of these surfaces, there can only be movements of opening and closing of this articulation. The first phalanx is directed backwards during flexion and forwards during extension. In the dog and the cat the digits can be separated from each other, and also drawn together--that is to say, abducted and adducted; but, as in man, these movements can be made only when the first phalanges are in the state of extension. During flexion they are impossible, because of the tension of the lateral ligaments, which increases as the flexion is more pronounced. This can be demonstrated, for example, in the cat, which, in order to separate the digits, opens the hand widely--that is to say, forcibly raises the first phalanges. =The Interphalangeal Articulations.=--The phalanges are in contact with one another by surfaces, which, on one side, are of trochlear form, and, on the other, are moulded on these trochleÃ¦; accordingly, at the level of these articulations, the movements of flexion and extension only can take place. In the felidÃ¦, the claws which the third phalanges bear cannot be utilized when the latter are in a state of extension, at which time, being forcibly raised, they are, in fact, placed on the outer sides of the phalanges, which are grooved to receive them. But when the animal wishes to use them, it flexes those third phalanges, of which the terminal extremity is then projected forward, and the claws are ready to fulfil their function. But at the same time it extends the first phalanges, to produce a certain tension of the flexors of the digits, and thus enable the latter to act with greater efficacy, with a minimum of contraction. We can demonstrate this action experimentally on ourselves. It is enough to carry the first phalanges forcibly into a state of extension; the third phalanges then become flexed, quite spontaneously, by the tension of the tendons of the flexors which are inserted into them. At the same time, if we examine the felidÃ¦ which we have taken as examples, when the first phalanges are in the state of extension, the digits will be found to be separable, as we have already indicated in connection with the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations, with the result that the claws are then able to lacerate a wider surface. The extension of the ungual phalanx, which determines the retraction of the claw and stops its action, is the mechanical result of an elastic, fibrous apparatus which is attached to each of the third phalanges, and has its origin of the second. THE POSTERIOR LIMBS[14] [14] Examine Figs. 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 49. The posterior limbs are divided, as are the inferior limbs of the human being, of which they are the homologues, into four parts: pelvis, thigh, leg, and foot. The Pelvis The pelvis, which incompletely limits the abdominal cavity, inferiorly in the vertical position of the body and posteriorly in the normal attitude of quadrupeds, is formed by the iliac bones and sacrum--the coccyx forming a prolongation of the latter. We have already described the two latter (pp. 10 and 11) in connection with the vertebral column, of which they form the inferior or posterior portion or segment, according to the attitude of the individual. =The Iliac Bone.=--The iliac or coxal bone, is a paired or non-symmetrical bone, united below to its fellow of the opposite side, while it is separated from it above by the sacrum. In all animals, as well as in man, the iliac bone, at the beginning of life, consists of three parts, which afterwards unite and fuse together and join at the middle of the bottom of a deep cavity which is situated on the outer aspect of the bone--the cotyloid cavity. Of those three portions when examined in the human iliac bone, that above the cavity is the ilium; that on the inside is the pubis; and the last, the lower one, is the ischium. In quadrupeds, the iliac bone being, in its entirety, directed much more obliquely downwards and backwards, the relative position of these constituent parts is a little modified: the ilium is in front, the pubis is still internal, but in a more inferior position, and the ischium is behind the cotyloid cavity. We notice this peculiarity of the development of the iliac bone because it is customary to continue to apply to the osseous regions which correspond to these parts the names by which they were known when independent bones. [Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE LEFT ILIAC BONE OF THE HUMAN BEING: EXTERNAL SURFACE, PLACED IN THE POSITION WHICH IT WOULD OCCUPY IN THE SKELETON OF A QUADRUPED. 1, Cotyloid cavity; 2, ilium; 3, iliac crest; 4, anterior iliac crest; 5, posterior iliac spine; 6, pubis; 7, tuberosity of the ischium; 8, obturator foramen; 9, ischiadic spine.] [Illustration: FIG. 44.--LEFT ILIAC BONE OF A QUADRUPED (HORSE): EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Cotyloid cavity; 2, ilium, external iliac fossa (directed upward in the horse); 3, iliac crest; 4, anterior iliac spine (directed inwards in the horse, it is the angle of the haunch); 5, posterior iliac spine (directed inwards in the horse; it is the angle of the haunch); 6, pubis; 7, tuberosity of the ischium; 8, obturator foramen; 9, ischiadic spine, or subcotyloid foramen.] The bones which form the skeleton of the pelvis of quadrupeds are proportionally more elongated and less massive than those of the human pelvis (Figs. 43 and 44). We find, on the external surface of the iliac bone, the cotyloid cavity, whose border is interrupted by the cotyloid notch; a deep notch which looks downwards. In front of this cavity is the ilium. This portion, narrow in the part which is next the cavity, is directed forwards and upwards, expanding more and more as it passes upwards. It presents an external or superior surface (external in some animals, superior in others), which recalls the external iliac fossa; and an internal or inferior surface, at the superior part of which is found the auricular surface for articulation with the sacrum. The anterior border of the ilium is rough; this is the iliac crest, at the extremities of which we find, below or outside, a prominence which corresponds to the anterior superior iliac spine of man; and internally another projection which corresponds to the posterior iliac spine. Immediately above the cotyloid cavity is a rough crest, which is known as the _supracotyloid crest_, which is, however, no other than the homologue of the sciatic spine. In front of this prominence, the border of the ilium, which is notched, forms the great sciatic notch. If, still taking the cotyloid cavity as the point of departure, we proceed inwards--that is, towards the median line of the body--we find the pubis; if in a posterior direction, the ischium. These two portions, pubis and ischium, limit an oval orifice, the subpubic foramen. In the human skeleton, the pubis of one side is united to that of the opposite side, to form the pubic symphysis. In the animals which we are now studying a portion of the ischium enters into the formation of the symphysis; in other words, it is formed, not only by the body of the pubis, but also by the descending branch or ramus of the pubis and a portion of the ascending branch or ramus of the ischium, which are fused with those of the opposite side. It results that, though in the human being the symphysis is short and the ischio-pubic arch large, in quadrupeds it is the opposite. In them the arch is a mere slot, and being formed by the ischium alone, merits the name of the ischial arch. The ischio-pubic symphysis is very large, and forms a horizontal surface relatively extensive, a sort of floor, on which rest certain organs which occupy the cavity of the pelvis. The posterior and external angle of the ischium is rough and prominent; it is the tuberosity of the ischium. This forms a projection under the skin; it also does in man when the trunk is strongly inclined forwards, while the thighs are maintained in the vertical position. In marsupials--opossum, kangaroo, and phalanger--the pelvis at its pubic region is surmounted by two bones, situated one on each side of the median line, and arranged in the form of a fork of two prongs (Fig. 45). These, which are called _marsupial bones_, support the pouch which, in animals of this genus, lodges their young, which, at the time of birth, are incapable of supporting a separate existence, their development being absolutely incomplete. [Illustration: FIG. 45.--PUBIC REGION OF THE PELVIS OF A MARSUPIAL (PHALANGER, FOX). 1, Symphysis pubis; 2, obturator foramen; 3, marsupial bones.] In the cetaceans--for example, the dolphin--because of the absence of posterior limbs, the pelvis is represented by two separate bones only, which have no connection with the vertebral column. In birds, the pelvis is remarkable for its elongated form (see for its form Fig. 21, and for details Fig. 46). The cotyloid cavity is pierced by an opening, and presents on its posterior border, which is here a little prominent, a surface with which the great trochanter is in contact. The ilium is very highly developed, and is fused in the median line with the ilium of the opposite side, the last dorsal vertebrÃ¦, the lumbar vertebrÃ¦, and the sacrum. Because of these relations with the dorsal vertebrÃ¦, it is in contact anteriorly with the last ribs, which consequently emerge from each side of the iliac region of the pelvis. The ischium forms a plate of bone which, in part, closes the external portion of the cavity of the pelvis. Its superior border is separate for a certain distance from the external border of the ilium; there is thus left an opening of more or less considerable size, which represents or takes the place of the great sciatic notch. [Illustration: FIG. 46.--PELVIS OF A BIRD (THE COCK): EXTERNAL SURFACE, LEFT SIDE. 1, Ilium; 2, ischium; 3, pubis; 4, inferior extremity of the pubis; 5, sciatic foramen; 6, oval foramen, homologous to the obturator; 7, coccygeal vertebrÃ¦.] The pubis, long and slender, is in connection with the inferior border of the ischium, of which it follows the general direction; and circumscribes with this latter, below the cotyloid cavity, an oval orifice, which is the homologue of the obturator foramen. Its inferior extremity reaches beyond the corresponding part of the ischium, bending towards the middle line, but without joining the pubis of the opposite side. On this account there is no symphysis pubis in birds. Nevertheless, an exception must be noted in the case of the ostrich, the pubic bones of which meet in the middle line, and are articulated in form of a symphysis. The Thigh A single bone, the femur, forms the skeleton of this portion of the lower limb. =The Femur.=--The bone of the thigh is, in man, directed downwards and inwards; this obliquity, we may remind the reader, is due to the difference in length of the two condyles which form its inferior extremity; the internal is the more prominent, the result of which is that when the femur is held vertically, the internal condyle descends lower than the external. Now, as those two articular expansions rest on the horizontal plane formed by the upper extremity of the tibia, it follows that the superior part of the femur inclines towards the side of the shorter condyle--that is to say, outwards--and that, the leg being vertical, it and the bone of the thigh unite in forming an angle, of which the apex is directed towards the inner side of the knee. In many mammals the two condyles are equally prominent, the result of which is that the femur inclines neither inwards nor outwards, but is contained in a plane parallel to the axis of the trunk; while the leg is included in the same plane. Nevertheless, although contained in the plane which we have just indicated, the femur is obliquely placed, and directed downwards and forwards; it accordingly forms, with the pelvis, an angle, of which the opening is directed to the anterior aspect of the body. In reptiles and in birds the femur and leg are both placed in the same plane, but this plane is not parallel to the axis of the trunk. This is the result, on the one hand, of the thorax being wide, and, on the other hand, of the femur, which is directed forwards, being in contact by its anterior extremity with the lateral aspect of the costal region, it is thus necessarily placed in a direction forwards and outwards, and the knee is further removed from the axis of the trunk than is the articulation which unites the thigh with the pelvis. The femur, like the humerus, is almost completely enveloped by muscular masses, which bind it to the lateral walls of the abdomen. Its inferior extremity alone is free, and is always the more so in proportion to its elongation--that is to say, as it belongs to an animal whose foot is more divided. The femur in this respect conforms to the law which we have indicated in connection with the bone of the arm, in which the development, as to length, is in proportion to the division of the hand. If we compare the femur of certain animals with that of man, we see that the corresponding details of form are readily recognisable, but they are slightly modified. Thus, on examining the superior extremity, we find there a head, a neck, a great trochanter, and a lesser; but the neck is usually short and thick, and the great trochanter does not occupy the same level with regard to the articular head of the bone. In man, the great trochanter does not rise to the level of the head of the femur; in the dog and the cat it approaches that level; in the horse and in ruminants it rises above it. With regard to the inferior extremity, its surfaces undergo modifications which are further accentuated as we pass from the digitigrades to the ungulates, or unguligrades. We know that in man the femoral trochlea is continuous behind, without interruption, with the condyles--that is to say, that each of the condyles is the continuation of one of the lips of the trochlea. We have just said that the trochlea is continuous without interruption with the condyles; this is accurate. Nevertheless, we must remark that, at the level of the junction of these surfaces, the bone presents a slight constriction, which is more marked on the external than on the internal aspect. This constriction, which is but slightly marked in man, is accentuated in the dog and the cat; in the ruminants and the solipeds it is still more pronounced so that we may say that in these latter the trochlea and the condyles are almost completely separated. There is another modification in regard to the prominence and extent of the two lips of the trochlea. In man, the external lip of the trochlea reaches higher than the internal, and it is more prominent in front. In the dog, these lips are equal with regard to thickness, but the external still reaches higher than the internal; in the cat, they are equal in every respect; in ruminants and solipeds the internal lip is wider, thicker, and rises higher than the external. In animals the trochlea is, as a general rule, narrower than in man, and the condyles are more prominent posteriorly; so that, when viewed from one of the lateral aspects, the inferior extremity of the femur is, in them, better developed in the antero-posterior direction. In birds, the femur is shorter than the bones of the leg; its great trochanter is in contact with a prominence which occupies the posterior part of the border of the cotyloid cavity. Instead of articulating at the level of the knee, with the knee-cap and tibia only, as in man, it articulates, in addition, with the superior extremity of the fibula. A similar arrangement is found in marsupials and reptiles. =The Knee-cap.=--This bone, developed in the thickness of the tendon of the triceps muscle of the thigh, is in contact, by its posterior surface, with the femoral trochlea. The two articular surfaces which are applied to the lips of the trochlea present, with regard to their extent, an inequality which is in proportion to the arrangement which we have above indicated--that is, while in man it is the external surface which is the larger, in the horse it is the internal. We shall see what the general form of the knee-cap is when we come, later on, to study more particularly the posterior limbs of some animals. The Leg The skeleton of the leg consists of two bones: the tibia and the fibula. The tibia is the more internal and the larger of the two; the fibula is slender, and situated on the outer side, and a little posterior to, the preceding. The fibula is more or less developed according to the species; in some it is complete, in others it is very much atrophied. This peculiarity may be compared with that which we have drawn attention to regarding the development of the ulna; but here the seriation is less distinct. Not only in the different species, but even in the individuals of the same species, the development of the fibula presents little regularity. In quadrupeds, the bones of the leg are directed obliquely downwards and backwards, so that they form, with the femur, which is directed obliquely downwards and forwards, an angle, the apex of which is placed at the anterior surface of the knee. =Tibia.=--The tibia of quadrupeds is readily comparable with that of man; as in the case of the latter, its shaft has three surfaces--an external, which is hollowed out in its upper portion, and becomes anterior below; an internal, slightly convex and subcutaneous; the posterior, which presents, in its superior part, a crest, the oblique line of the tibia, and some rugosities. The borders separate the surfaces. The anterior border, or crest of the tibia, is prominent in its superior part; below it gradually disappears in passing towards the internal aspect of the inferior extremity. The external and internal borders separate the corresponding surfaces from the posterior one. The superior extremity is thick, and expands in forming three tuberosities: two lateral and an anterior. The anterior tuberosity, situated at the superior part of the crest of the tibia, is very prominent; for this reason the superior extremity is very much expanded in the antero-posterior direction--hence it results that this diameter is equal to the transverse, and sometimes even greater. In man, it is the latter which is the larger. The anterior tuberosity is visible under the skin. The inferior extremity, less thick, is prolonged internally by a prominence which corresponds to the internal malleolus of man. In animals whose fibula is but slightly developed the tibia presents, on the external part of its inferior extremity, a small prominence, which replaces the fibular malleolus. The ruminants must, however, be excepted, in which we find in this region a special bone, which certain authors look on as the inferior part of the fibula (see p. 97). The inferior surface of this extremity of the tibia is articular; and is in contact with one of the tarsal bones, the astragalus. Because the superior surface of this latter has the form of a pulley, a pulley much more marked than that on the human astragalus, the corresponding surface of the tibia, which has the opposite form, presents two lateral cavities, separated by a median ridge, which is directed forwards and slightly outwards; this ridge projects into the groove of the pulley. =The Fibula.=--This bone, situated at the back of the external surface of the tibia, is, as we have said, more or less developed. Its superior extremity, or head, articulates with the external tuberosity of the tibia. Its inferior extremity, when it exists--it is this which disappears in animals which have the fibula incompletely developed--forms a prominence which, placed on the external surface of the inferior extremity of the tibia, articulates with the astragalus, and recalls the external malleolus of man. We have stated above that it is the inferior extremity of the fibula which disappears when the bone is incompletely developed; it is necessary to except the bat, in which the fibula, fairly well developed at its inferior extremity, by which it articulates with the tibia, thins off in its superior portion, and does not reach the corresponding extremity of the latter. Further, as in this animal the surface of the knee, which corresponds to the anterior surface of the same region in other animals, is turned backwards, the result is that the fibula is situated on the inner side of the tibia, instead of being placed on the outer. The Foot The foot, in animals, as well as in man, is formed of three portions, which, as we pass from the part which articulates with the leg towards the terminal extremity, are: the tarsus, the metatarsus, and the toes. These three portions are the homologues of the carpus, the metacarpus, and the fingers, which, as we have already seen in the case of the hand, are the osseous groups which form its skeleton. The tarsus is formed of short bones, as the carpus is; these are, in man, seven in number. The bones are arranged in two rows: one, the posterior, formed of two bones superimposed--the astragalus, by which the tarsus articulates with the leg, and the calcaneum, which forms the prominence of the heel; and an anterior row formed of five juxtaposed ones--the cuboid, situated externally, and the scaphoid internally, in front of which are found the three cuneiforms. To the tarsus succeeds the metatarsus, whose form reminds us very much of that of the metacarpals. With regard to the toes, which we enumerate in proceeding from the most internal to the most external, they are formed of phalanges, which are three in number for the four outer toes; but the number is reduced to two in the case of the first--that is, the so-called great-toe. The bones of the tarsus are not seven in all animals; they are fewer in ruminants and solipeds. We already know that, in the latter, the metacarpals and the digits are equally reduced in number; the same is the case for the metatarsals and the toes. We will analyze these differences when dealing with the species individually. When we studied the anterior limbs, we saw in passing from the plantigrades to the digitigrades, and finally the ungulates, or unguligrades, as the hand became hyperextended, the carpus was raised and more and more removed from the ground. We shall establish the existence of the same condition in the posterior limbs; in the plantigrades the tarsus rests on the ground; in the digitigrades it is removed from it; while in the unguligrades the distance which separates it from the point of support is still more considerable; and it is, indeed, necessary to imagine that if these latter were plantigrades, would occupy the position on the ground which is indicated by Fig. 47. In veterinary anatomy the tarsus is called the _ham_; a name we adopt in conformity with usage, but which we cannot but regret, as in human anatomy the ham is the region of the posterior surface of the knee. The general arrangement of the region of the digits of the posterior limbs in birds, presents some points of interest. We shall merely say with regard to the metatarsus, that it is formed by a single bone, which in the cock is furnished towards its inferior third with a pointed process, the _spur_. At the inferior part, there is, however, found another, which is but very slightly developed, and with which the first phalanx of the innermost toe articulates. The toes are, in the majority of species, four in number:[15] an internal, which is directed backwards, and corresponds to the great-toe; the others are directed forwards. This arrangement is constant in grallatores (wading birds), gallinaceÃ¦[16] (domestic fowls), and raptores (birds of prey). [15] In spite of the fact that the custom is to designate the terminal portions of the foot of birds by the name of digits, we prefer to employ here the terms _foot_ and _toes_. In adopting this decision we believe we are acting according to a more didactic method. Homology of names should, in our opinion, always accompany homology of regions. [16] With regard to the gallinaceÃ¦, we must add that in certain varieties the number of toes is five; those which are directed forwards are three in number; the internal one which passes backward, is double. The two toes which are the subject of this special arrangement are placed very close together, and are nearly always superimposed. This condition is found in the Houdan and Dorking breeds. [Illustration: FIG. 47.--POSTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE PLACED IN THE POSITION WHICH IT SHOULD OCCUPY IF THE ANIMAL WERE A PLANTIGRADE: LEFT LIMB, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Tibia; 2, astragalus; 3, calcaneum; 4, metatarsus; 5, first phalanx; 6, second phalanx; 7, third phalanx.] In climbing birds (parrots, woodpeckers, and toucans), the innermost toe is not only directed backward, but the external toe accompanies it in that direction; consequently, there are two posterior and two anterior toes. Sometimes they are all directed forwards; this disposition is found in the martins. In some birds, the number of toes is reduced to three: the cassowary shows this reduction; in others, the number is still further diminished--the ostrich, for example, has but two. [Illustration: FIG. 48.--SKELETON OF THE FOOT OF A BIRD (THE COCK): LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Metatarsus; 2, spur; 3, rudimentary metatarsal; 4, first toe; 5, second toe; 6, third toe; 7, fourth toe.] Further, we find that, in general, the number of the phalanges increases, when we examine the toes in commencing with the most internal (Fig. 48): this has two; then the following one three; that which comes next in order has four; and the most external toe has five. The phalanges of this last are short; so that, although it is formed by a larger number of bones, it is not the longest of the toes. THE POSTERIOR LIMBS IN SOME ANIMALS. =Plantigrades=: =Bear= (Fig. 33, p. 50).--The external iliac fossa is very deep. The femur is longer than the bones of the leg; the great trochanter does not reach the level of the head of the femur. The fibula is well developed; it is united to the tibia at its superior and inferior extremities only. The foot, which, as in the case of the hand, rests on the ground by the whole extent of its plantar surface, presents five toes; the shortest of these is the internal--that is, the toe which corresponds to the great-toe in man; the third and fourth are the longest, and they are almost equal; there is a very slight difference in favour of the fourth, which is slightly superior in dimensions to the third. =Digitigrades=: =Cat=, =Dog= (Fig. 34, p. 52).--The external iliac fossa, which looks outwards, is deep; the iliac crest is convex anteriorly, the convexity is continued from one iliac spine to the other. [Illustration: FIG. 49.--PELVIS OF THE DOG, SEEN FROM ABOVE. 1, Iliac crest; 2, external iliac fossa; 3, sacrum; AAÂ´, bi-iliac diameter; BBÂ´, bi-ischial diameter.] In the dog, the distance which separates the anterior iliac spines is less than that which separates the ischia (Fig. 49). On a skeleton which we measured, the transverse diameter, the distance from the anterior iliac spine of one side to that of the opposite side, was 8 centimetres, whilst the distance which separated the ischia was 105 millimetres; on another skeleton, the first measurement was 127 metres, and the second was 146 millimetres. It seems to us unnecessary to multiply examples. In the cat, the iliac spines are but slightly marked; the result is that the iliac crest is almost confounded with the inferior and superior borders of the ilium. The two diameters referred to above are almost equal (Fig. 50). We draw particular attention to what we have just noted in regard to the transverse proportions of the iliac and ischiatic regions of the dog and the cat. These relations are evidently of importance with regard to shape, since the iliac crests and the ischia are noticeable beneath the skin. [Illustration: FIG. 50.--PELVIS OF A FELIDE (LION), VIEWED FROM ABOVE. 1, Iliac crest; 2, external iliac fossa; 3, sacrum; AAÂ´, bi-iliac diameter; BBÂ´, bi-ischial diameter.] In the dog, the shaft of the femur is slightly convex in front; but in the cat it is straight. The borders of the shaft are slightly marked, so that it is almost cylindrical. The _linea aspera_, less prominent than in man, gains in width what it loses in elevation; it constitutes what may almost be called a rough _surface_. This surface is narrower in its middle portion than at its extremities, where it bifurcates to go upwards to the two trochanters, and downwards to the two condyles. At the superior extremity, the neck is short, the great trochanter reaching almost to the level of the head of the femur; the digital _cavity_, which is situated on the internal surface of the great trochanter, is very deep. At its inferior extremity it projects strongly backward. The trochlea is narrow; in the cat its two lips are equally prominent, while in the dog the external is a little more elevated than the internal, which on its part is a little thicker. The trochlea is still more independent of the condyles than in the human femur; it is separated from these latter by a slight constriction. The knee-cap is long and narrow. The tibia of the dog is slightly curved from before backward: it has the form of an elongated S; this conformation is in great part due to the very marked projection of the anterior tuberosity and of the superior portion of the crest, which, a little below that tuberosity, turns abruptly backwards, and thus describes a curve the concavity of which is directed forward. The superior part of the external surface is very much hollowed out. The superior extremity is much thicker than the inferior one. It is not only wide in the transverse direction, but is more especially extended from before backwards; the prominence of the anterior tuberosity is the cause of the elongation of this antero-posterior diameter. On the posterior part of the external tuberosity is found a surface to which the superior extremity of the fibula is applied. The inferior extremity presents an articular surface, which is formed of two lateral cavities, separated by a crest, which is directed obliquely forwards and outwards. The internal part is prominent, and forms the internal malleolus. With regard to the fibula, it is united to the tibia by its extremities and by the inferior half of its shaft. This latter is more expanded below than in its upper part. The superior extremity is flattened from without inwards. The inferior extremity projects beyond the articular surface of the tibia, and forms the external malleolus, which, instead of, as in man, descending further than the tibial malleolus, stops at the same level, and even descends a little less than does the latter. In the cat, the curve of the tibia is less pronounced; this is due to the fact that the crest, instead of being concave in its middle portion, is slightly convex anteriorly. The fibula, less flattened than that of the dog, is united to the tibia by its extremities only, and is separate in the rest of its extent. The bones of the tarsus are seven in number, and arranged as in man, with this difference (which is easily comprehended), that their general relations are changed on account of the vertical direction of the tarsus. For example, the astragalus, instead of being above the calcaneum, is situated in front of it; the cuneiform bones, instead of being situated in front of the scaphoid, are found below it, etc. These animals have but four well-developed metatarsals; that which corresponds to the great-toe is represented merely by a small style-shaped bone, situate at the internal part of the region. Nevertheless, we find this toe fully developed in some dogs. Notwithstanding this, the bones which form it are, however, but rudimentary, and much smaller than those of the innermost digit of the fore-limb. Sometimes it is double; this condition is demonstrable in individuals belonging to breeds of large size. The median metatarsals are more fully developed than the other bones of the same region which are next them. Viewed as a whole, the metatarsal bones are a little longer than the metacarpals; the result is that the distance which separates the tarsus from the ground is a little greater than that which separates the carpus from the plane on which the anterior limbs rest. The length of the calcaneum still further exaggerates this difference, and, as in the animals with which we shall occupy ourselves later on, the projection which this bone forms is distinctly higher than that which is produced by the pisiform. The metatarsus, as a whole, is a little narrower than the metacarpus; not only on account of the presence of a thumb in the anterior limb, but, further, because the bones of this latter region are wider than those of the corresponding part of the posterior limb. The phalanges closely resemble those of the anterior limbs. =Unguligrades=: =Pig= (Fig. 38, p. 58).--The pelvis in this animal presents a few of the characters which we shall again meet with in the ruminants and the solipeds; however, the posterior (or internal) iliac spines are relatively more widely separated from one another than in the latter. This arrangement reminds us of that found in the carnivora. The femur presents nothing very special. The knee-cap is thick, and ovoid in outline. The fibula is completely developed, as in the carnivora; and is connected with the tibia at both its extremities. The tarsus consists of seven bones. The astragalus and the calcaneum differ slightly from those of ruminants. The foot, like the hand, has two median digits which rest on the ground by their third phalanges; and an internal and an external digit, which are removed from it. The metatarsals are a little longer than the metacarpals. [Illustration: FIG. 51.--PELVIS OF THE OX: SUPERIOR SURFACE. 1, Iliac crest; 2, external iliac fossa; 3, sacrum; AAÂ´, bi-iliac diameter; BBÂ´, bi-ischiadic diameter.] =Unguligrades=: =Sheep=, =Ox= (Fig. 39, p. 61).--The pelvis of ruminants of this group closely resembles that of the horse, which we will study later on (see p. 99). That which we must at once point out is that, with regard to the ratio formed by a comparison of the bi-iliac and bi-ischiatic diameters, it may be placed between the ratio obtained in comparing those diameters in the pelvis of the carnivora and that of the solipeds. Indeed, in the ruminants, the distance which separates the ischia exceeds the width of one iliac only, and does not equal, as in the felide, the total width of the anterior part of the pelvis (Fig. 51). In the skeleton of the ox, which forms part of the anatomical museum of the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, the bi-ischiadic diameter is 39 centimetres, whilst the width of one iliac crest is 29 centimetres, so that, in contrast to that which we find in the dog, the width of the ischiadic region is less than that formed in front by the addition of the iliac crests. The great trochanter is large, and extends beyond the level of the plane in which the head of the femur is found. In the ox, the linea aspera, instead of being a narrow crest, is spread out, and forms in reality a surface; the posterior surface of the femur. At the inferior and external part of this surface is situated a cavity which surmounts the corresponding condyle, and is known as the _supracondyloid fossa_. On the internal part of the same region there are a series of tubercles, which, because of their position in relation to the corresponding condyle, constitute the _supracondyloid crest_. The internal lip of the trochlea is much thicker and much more prominent than the external. The details which we have just now examined in connection with the ox are less marked in the sheep. The trochlea, narrow as a whole, is clearly separate from the condyles by a very marked constriction. The patella, which is thickened in the antero-posterior direction, has the shape of a triangular pyramid with the base upwards. Its posterior surface, which articulates with the trochlea, presents an arrangement which is adapted to the disposition of this latter--that is to say, the surface which is in contact with the internal lip is larger than that which articulates with the lip of the opposite side. The tibia of the ox is proportionately shorter than that of the sheep. The shaft of this bone is flattened from before backwards, in its inferior half. The median crest of the articular surface of the inferior extremity is the most prominent part of that region. [Illustration: FIG. 52.--TARSUS OF THE OX: POSTERIOR LEFT LIMB, ANTERO-EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Tibia; 2, coronoid bone of the tarsus; 3, superior articular surface of the astragalus; 4, inferior articular surface of the astragalus; 5, calcaneum; 6, cuboido-scaphoid bone; 7, great cuneiform bone--the small cuneiform bone is situated at the back of the latter; 8, principal metatarsal--the small, or rudimentary, metatarsal bone is very small; it is situated at the back of the preceding, and is not to be seen in the sketch. It would be visible if the view were directly lateral, but then the superior and inferior articular surfaces of the astragalus would be less apparent.] The fibula is extremely atrophied. The shaft and superior extremity of this bone are represented merely by a simple ligamentous cord, which is sometimes ossified. There remains of the fibula, as a portion well and distinctly developed, the inferior extremity only. This presents itself under the form of a small bone situated in the region ordinarily occupied by the inferior extremity of the outer bone of the leg--that is to say, the external part of the inferior extremity of the tibia; this little bone articulates with the astragalus and the calcaneum. Some authors consider it to be a tarsal bone, and describe it under the name of the coronoid bone of the tarsus (Fig. 52, 2). It is not, perhaps, quite legitimate to describe it as a bone of this region, for it has not a homologue in the tarsus of other animals. Its external surface is rough; its superior border is furnished with a small pointed process occupying a depression which is provided for it by the tibia. It reaches lower down than the latter, and forms in this way a sort of external malleolus, which frames, on the outer aspect, the mortise in which the astragalus is maintained. The tarsus, as a whole, has an elongated form; it is formed of five bones: the astragalus, calcaneum, cuboid and scaphoid, which coalesce, to form a single bone, and two cuneiform bones, which correspond to the second and third cuneiform bones of the human foot. These cuneiforms are called, from their size, commencing internally, by the names small and great cuneiform. The calcaneum is long and narrow; it is longer than that of the horse; it is on the anterior and external part that the bone (coronoid tarsal bone) which represents the inferior extremity of the fibula is situated. It forms the prominence known as _the point of the ham_, a prominence which is no other than the heel, which, in the unguligrades, is, as we have already said, very far removed from the ground. The astragalus, which is elongated in the vertical direction, has three articular surfaces disposed in the form of trochleÃ¦: a superior trochlea, which is in contact with the skeleton of the leg, and which is present in all animals; an inferior, which replaces the articular head found on the anterior aspect of the astragalus in man; this articulates with the portion of the scaphoido-cuboid that corresponds to the scaphoid; and, lastly, a posterior trochlea with which the calcaneum articulates. Of these three trochleÃ¦, the superior is the most strongly marked. Between this latter and the inferior is found, on the anterior surface of the astragalus, a deep depression, which, during flexion of the foot on the leg, receives a prominence which the inferior extremity of the tibia presents in its median portion. We can easily recognise the trochleÃ¦ which we have been discussing, in the little bones which children use 'to play at bones'; these bones are no other than the astragali of sheep. We have already mentioned that the scaphoid and the cuboid are ankylosed; they form by their union an irregular bone, on which the astragalus and calcaneum are supported. The cuneiforms articulate with the internal half of the superior extremity of the principal metatarsal; the external half of this metatarsal articulates with the portion of bone which represents the cuboid. The metatarsus is represented by a principal metatarsal, formed by the coalescence of two metatarsals; we also find in this region a very small rudimentary metatarsal. The metatarsus is a little longer than the metacarpus; its transverse measurement is a little less; on the other hand, it is a little thicker in antero-posterior direction; from these two differences it results that the body of the metatarsus is quadrilateral, whereas the metacarpus presents only an anterior and a posterior surface. The rudimentary metatarsal is a very small roundish bone, situated at the back of the superior extremity of the principal metatarsal. The phalanges closely resemble those of the anterior limbs; nevertheless, the first and second phalanges differ from the latter in the fact that they are a little longer and narrower. At the back of the metatarso-phalangeal articulations, as in the corresponding region of the anterior limbs, are found the sesamoid bones. Such also exist at the articulations of the second and third phalanges. =Unguligrades=: =Horse= (Fig. 40, p. 64).--The pelvis of the horse presents a general form which sharply differentiates it from that of the carnivora; in fact, the ilium is twisted in such a way that the external iliac fossa does not look outwards, but upwards. It results from this twist that the anterior iliac spine, which we have seen to be directed downwards in the carnivora, has become external; and this prominence is much farther removed from the vertebral column than in the dog or cat. On the other hand, the posterior iliac spine, which is directed upwards in the carnivora, has become internal; it is also placed nearer to the vertebral column, with the result that the distance which separates this spine from that of the bone of the opposite side is proportionately less. The internal iliac spine, which is conical in shape, and curved upwards, forms a prominence known as _the angle of the crupper_; the external iliac spine, thick and provided with tuberosities, forms a clearly-defined prominence; this is the angle of the _haunch_. The iliac crest, extending directly from one spine to the other, is curved, its concavity being turned upwards. The external iliac fossa, which looks upward, is limited anteriorly by this crest, and is, like the latter, slightly hollowed. The portion of the bone which connects the ilium to the region occupied by the cotyloid cavity is extremely narrow; posteriorly, the bone enlarges again to form the ischial and pubic portions. The tuberosity of the ischium, thick and curved upwards, but less so than in the ox, forms the most prominent part of the posterior border of the region of the thigh; this projecting portion, so sharply defined in spare subjects, is known as the _point_ or _angle of the buttock_. Contrary to what we have indicated in the case of the dog, the distance which separates the ischiatic tuberosities is inconsiderable in proportion to that which we find between the external iliac spine of one side and that of the opposite. The bi-ischiatic diameter does not even equal the width of one iliac bone measured at the level of its crest (Fig. 53). On the skeleton of the horse in the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, the distance which separates the tuberosities of the ischia is 225 millimetres; that between the two spines of each iliac bone is 25 centimetres. The anterior region of the crupper is thus much broader than that occupied by the ischia. The femur is relatively short. Its shaft is rectilinear, and does not present the anterior convexity which is found on the human femur, and which we indicated when discussing that of the dog. The shaft of the bone, instead of being prismatic and triangular, presents four surfaces; the anterior, internal, and external, almost pass into each other, being separated one from the other merely by rounded and slightly marked borders; the posterior surface, which is plane, replaces the linea aspera, which in the horse, instead of presenting the appearance of a crest, is considerably widened. The numerous irregularities which this surface presents give insertion to the muscles which correspond to those attached to the linea aspera. Between this posterior surface and the external is found a rough prominence which curves forward; this was designated by Cuvier the _third trochanter_; it replaces the external branch of the superior line of bifurcation of the linea aspera; other authors call it the _infratrochanteric crest_, because it is situated below the great trochanter. At the inferior part of the same region is found a deep fossa, the borders of which are rough; this is the _supracondyloid fossa_. [Illustration: FIG 53.--PELVIS OF THE HORSE: SUPERIOR SURFACE. 1, Iliac crest; 2, external iliac fossa; 3, sacrum; AAÂ´, bi-iliac diameter; BBÂ´, bi-ischiatic diameter.] Between the posterior surface and the internal are found: above, the lesser trochanter, which is long and rough; below, at the level of the supracondyloid fossa, an equally rough surface known by the name of the _supracondyloid crest_. The superior extremity is flattened from before backwards. The neck is not well marked. The great trochanter is very prominent, and projects beyond the level of the head of the femur. We divide the great trochanter into three parts: the summit, which is the most elevated portion; the convexity, which is situated in front; and the crest, formed by muscular impressions, situated outside and below the convexity. The digital fossa is situated behind and below the summit of the great trochanter. With regard to the lesser trochanter, it is placed so far down that it really forms part of the shaft of the bone, with which, besides, we have described it. On the inferior extremity of the femur are two condyles and a trochlea; the condyles are clearly separated from this latter by a marked constriction. The trochlea is directed with a slight obliquity downwards and inwards; its internal lip is much thicker and more prominent than the external; this is, accordingly, a condition exactly the opposite of that which characterizes the corresponding region of the human femur. The knee-cap is lozenge-shaped; its superior angle projects upward, and produces a prominence at the part which corresponds to the base of the human patella, the part which is here the thickest portion of the bone. Its anterior surface is convex and rough. Its posterior surface presents two lateral articular facets, separated by a crest; this surface is in contact with the trochlea of the femur, and, as it is the internal lip of the latter which is the more developed, it results therefrom that the internal articular surface of the knee-cap is larger than the external. The knee-cap contributes to the formation of the region of the posterior limb which is called the _stifle_. The tibia is large in its upper portion; in its inferior part it is flattened from before backwards. The posterior surface of the shaft presents an oblique line, below which are found vertical rough lines for the insertion of muscles. The external surface is hollowed out in its upper part. The anterior tuberosity of the tibia rises just to the level of the flat articular surface; it is hollowed in its median portion by a vertical groove of elongated form, which receives the ligament that binds the knee-cap to the tibia. The external tuberosity is more prominent than the internal; in it is found a groove for the passage of the anterior tibial muscle. The inferior extremity, flattened from before backwards, presents a surface which is moulded on the trochlea of the astragalus; the median crest of this surface is thick, and descends lower posteriorly than the tuberosities which are situated on the external and internal aspects of this extremity. Of the two tuberosities, that which is internal is comparable to the internal malleolus of man, the one on the outer side forms a sort of external malleolus; but this latter here belongs to the tibia, and not to the fibula. The fibula, in fact, does not reach the inferior extremity of the tibia; it is a poorly developed bone, elongated and terminating inferiorly in a point, at the middle of the shaft of the tibia or at its lower third. Its superior extremity, which is slightly expanded, articulates with the tuberosity which occupies the outer aspect of the corresponding extremity of the tibia. The bones of the tarsus are six in number: the calcaneum and astragalus form the upper row; the cuboid, scaphoid, and two cuneiforms form the lower (Fig. 54). The astragalus has not, as in ruminants, an inferior trochlea for articulation with the scaphoid; this portion of the bone presents a surface which is slightly convex. It articulates with the tibia by a trochlea that occupies not only the superior surface, but also the anterior. This trochlea, which is directed slightly obliquely downwards and outwards, has a very pronounced form; its lips, which are extremely prominent, determine by their anterior part one of the features which we recognise on the anterior aspect of the _ham_--a feature which is still more accentuated when the metatarsus (_canon_) is extended on the leg. On the internal surface of the astragalus is found a tubercle, which forms a projection in the corresponding region of the ham. The calcaneum, which is not quite so long as that of the ox, forms by its summit a prominence which is called _the point of the ham_. The cuboid is small; the scaphoid is large, and flattened from above downwards. Of the two cuneiforms, the more external is the larger; it closely resembles the scaphoid; it is flattened from above downwards as is the latter; but it is a little smaller in size. The small cuneiform, which occupies the inner side of the tarsus, is the smallest bone in this region; it is sometimes divided into two parts; this raises the number of the cuneiforms to three, and that of the bones of the tarsus to seven. [Illustration: FIG. 54.--TARSUS OF THE HORSE: LEFT POSTERIOR LIMB, ANTERIOR SURFACE. 1, Tibia; 2, internal tuberosity of the inferior extremity of the tibia (homologue of the internal malleolus of man); 3, external tuberosity of the inferior extremity of the tibia (homologue of the external malleolus); 4, median crest lodged in the groove of the pulley of the astragalus; 5, pulley of the astragalus; 6, internal tuberosity of the astragalus; 7, calcaneum; 8, cuboid; 9, scaphoid; 10, great cuneiform, the small cuneiform is placed behind this latter; 11, principal metatarsal; 12, external rudimentary metatarsal. The internal rudimentary metatarsal, being more slender than the external, does not appear in the figure.] The bones of the metatarsus and the phalanges are equal in number to the corresponding bones in the anterior limbs; they are formed on a type analogous to that of these latter. Accordingly, we shall merely indicate the differences which characterize them. The principal metatarsal is longer than the metacarpal of the same class; its shaft is more cylindrical; its inferior extremity is somewhat thicker. The external rudimentary metatarsal is better developed than the internal; in the metacarpus the reverse is the case. The phalanges so far resemble those of the anterior limb that, as differential characters, we need point out only the following: the first phalanx of the hind-foot is a little shorter than that of the fore-foot; its inferior extremity is a little narrower, and its superior extremity a little thicker. The second phalanx is a little less expanded laterally. The difference in appearance which the three phalanges, anterior and posterior, respectively present are to be borne in mind; for they are correlated to the general form of the fore and hind feet. We will establish this point when we come to study the hoof (see Figs. 101 and 102, p. 257). In the fore-foot the ungual phalanx has its inferior surface limited externally by a circular border, while the same bone of the hind-foot has this surface a little narrower, more concave, and limited by two curved borders which unite anteriorly to form an angle--an arrangement which gives to the general outline of this region the form of the letter V. Articulations of the Posterior Limbs =The Coxo-femoral Articulation.=--The head of the femur is received in the cotyloid cavity; these are the osseous surfaces in contact in this articulation. They are maintained in position by a fibrous capsule and a round ligament. To this latter is found attached, in the horse, a fasciculus which, commencing, as does the round ligament, at the depression on the head of the femur, emerges from the cotyloid cavity by the notch which is present in its circumference, and is attached to the anterior border of the pubes, to blend with the tendon of the rectus muscle of the abdomen. This is the pubio-femoral ligament. The movements which this joint permits are the same in the quadrupeds as in man, but less extensive. They are: flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, the two latter being much more limited than the former. There is also rotation. By flexion, the inferior extremity of the femur is directed forwards; the bone of the thigh then takes a more oblique direction than the normal. This movement takes place, for example, when the animal carries forward one of its hinder limbs. Extension, which takes place in an inverse sense, is produced when the foot is fixed on the ground, while the body is projected forward. It is also produced in the action of kicking. As for the lateral movements--viz., abduction and adduction--they are less extensive than the preceding movements. The absence of the pubio-femoral ligament in other quadrupeds than the horse explains why in them abduction is less limited than in the latter. Indeed, it is the tension of this ligament, occasioned by the abduction of the thighs, which arrests more quickly the movement in question. =Articulation of the Knee.=--This articulation, as in man, is formed by the femur, the patella, and the tibia. In the horse the ligament of the patella is not single, but consists of three parts, designated, on account of their position, by the respective names of external, internal, and median patellar ligaments. The two former come from the angles on the corresponding borders of the knee-cap; the median springs from the anterior surface and inferior angle of the same bone. They all three pass to their termination on the anterior tubercle of the tibia. The external ligament is the strongest, and the internal ligament the least developed. In the dog, the cat, the pig, and the sheep, the patellar ligament consists of a single band. The articulation is further strengthened on the sides by lateral ligaments--an internal and an external. With regard to the principal movements, these are flexion and extension, to which may be added movements of rotation of limited extent. In flexion, the leg bends on the thigh; its inferior extremity is directed upwards and backwards; the angle which the tibia naturally forms with the femur becomes less obtuse. But it should be understood that one part of this description--that which has relation to the leg--holds good only when the femur is in its normal condition, or in flexion. Indeed, at the close of the movement in which, during a step, the foot is in contact with the ground--that is, at the termination of the resting stage--the inferior extremity of the tibia is directed backwards. But the femur is then in a state of extension, and in regard to this latter the attitude of the leg is unchanged. [Illustration: FIG. 55.--EXTENSION OF THE LEG: RIGHT POSTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. (AFTER A CHRONOGRAPHIC STUDY BY PROFESSOR MAREY.)] At this moment, notwithstanding the direction, which recalls that which it has at the time of flexion, the leg is not bent on the thigh; on the contrary, it is almost in the line of its continuation (Fig. 55). As we have done in connection with the articulations of the anterior limbs, we borrow this figure from the interesting chronophotographic studies of Professor Marey.[17] [17] E. J. Marey, 'Analysis of the Movements of the Horse by the Chronophotograph' (_La Nature_, June 11, 1898). =The Tibio-tarsal Articulation and of the Bones of the Tarsus.=--In the region which veterinary anatomists call the ham, the articulations of the leg and foot alone call for special study in the case of the horse. The articulations of the bones of the tarsus, and of these with the metatarsus, do not offer any interest with regard to mobility, this being almost wholly absent at that level. The leg and the astragalus, in a general way, are placed in contact by such articular surfaces that the resulting joint, which is a true hinge, permits movements of flexion and extension only. Indeed, as we have indicated above, the tibia is furnished, on the inferior surface, with a crest that fits into the deep groove which is situated on the corresponding surface of the astragalus. During flexion, the anterior surface of the foot tends to approach the anterior surface of the leg, the angle formed by these two segments becoming more and more narrowed. The displacement in the opposite direction characterizes extension. In other quadrupeds, the articulations which bind together the bones of the tarsus possess a little more freedom of movement. The shape of these bones, and particularly the shape of the surfaces of the astragalus, which are in contact with them, allow movements in this region, in the case of the dog and cat, which, without being so extensive as those of the human foot, in the subastragaloid articulation, nevertheless, recall the mobility which we find in the human species at this level--that is to say, rotation, abduction, and adduction of the foot. As for the articulations of the metatarsus with the phalanges, and of the phalanges with one another, they resemble those of the anterior limb too closely that it should be necessary to study them here. Such a study would be, in this case, but a repetition (see p. 76, a description of the articulations in question). THE HEAD IN GENERAL, AND IN SOME ANIMALS IN PARTICULAR When we compare, by the examination of one of their lateral aspects, the skull of man and the same region in other mammals, it is easy to observe that the relative development of the cranium and face is entirely different. In the case of man the cranium is large, and the face relatively small; in animals the face is proportionally much more highly developed. The measure of the facial angle permits us to note these differences, and the figures relative to the value of this angle are sufficiently demonstrative to induce us to indicate those which are, in a general way, connected with some of the forms in individuals which here occupy our attention. In the first place, we must remember that the angle in question is more acute, as the cranium is less developed in proportion to the facial region (Figs. 56 and 57). It is especially to this character that we wish to draw attention. Man 70Â°-80Â° Cat 41Â° Dog 28Â°-41Â° Sheep 20Â°-25Â° Ox 18Â°-20Â° Ass 12Â°-16Â° Horse 11Â°-13Â° Besides, in animals the cranium is very prominent superiorly, and the face, more or less elongated, is sharply projected downwards and forwards; in man the cranial region occupies not only the superior, but also the posterior part; the face is short and of a compact form. The human head, in its general aspect, may be compared to a sphere, while the skull of the quadrupeds presents the aspect of a quadrangular pyramid, with the base turned upwards and the summit at the incisor teeth. =Direction of the Head.=--Before entering on the study of the bones of the head, it is necessary, in our opinion, to agree as to the position in which we shall suppose it to be placed. The question may seem to be one of little importance; nevertheless, it cannot be regarded as indifferent, since authors are not all agreed on this subject. Some suppose it to be placed vertically--that is, with the incisor teeth turned directly downwards. Others, on the contrary, suppose it to be placed horizontally, resting on the whole length of the lower jaw, the face being then turned upwards. These two extreme methods of arrangement appear to us to possess inconveniences--at least, for comparison with the human head. [Illustration: FIG. 56.--HUMAN SKULL: MEASURE OF THE FACIAL ANGLE BY THE METHOD OF CAMPER. ANGLE BAC = 80Â°. The internal wall of the cranial cavity is marked by the dotted line.] [Illustration: FIG. 57.--SKULL OF THE HORSE: MEASURE OF THE FACIAL ANGLE BY THE METHOD OF CAMPER.[18] ANGLE BAC = 13Â°. The internal wall of the cranial cavity is shown by the dotted line.] [18] We have indicated on this sketch of the skull of the horse the facial angle measured by the method of Camper, in order that the correspondence with Fig. 56 may be more complete. But it is certain that the procedure here employed is in practice not satisfactory, since the apex of the angle, as we can demonstrate, is found to be situated within the contour of the head, and that, consequently, it is rather difficult to localize it precisely in the case of a given skeleton. Further, because of the absence of the base of the nose in the complete skull, the auriculo-nasal line cannot be accurately fixed. It would be the same for most other animals. This is why the method employed for these latter is preferably that of Cuvier, or, again, that of Cloquet. In the former, the apex of the angle of Camper is transferred to the free border of the upper incisors, but these teeth may be absent, and, on the other hand, ruminants are destitute of them. In the second, the same apex is placed at the alveolar border, and the angle then becomes fairly easy to appreciate. Indeed, if, when the head is vertical, the same regions of the face (forehead, nose) are, in the case of animals as well as man, turned forward, the lower jaw ceases to merit its appellation, as it is then situated, not below, but behind the upper. Furthermore, if this position is chosen, for example, for modelling or drawing, it cannot be obtained without difficulty when we have to deal with an isolated piece of the skeleton, on account of the absence of equilibrium, which it is necessary to obviate. It is true that the question of convenience should not take precedence of all others, and it suffices for us in this connection to recall, in regard to the human pelvis, that, although the older anatomists used to represent it as resting commodiously on the three angles which terminate it at its lower part (ischial tuberosities and coccyx), this attitude being false, it is customary now to incline the superior aspect forwards, inasmuch as this arrangement more nearly conforms to reality, in spite of the fact that it is a little more difficult so to dispose an isolated pelvis. Further, to return to the head; if its vertical direction can be demonstrated, for example, in many horses, it is not sufficiently general to be adopted as the classic position. In regard to the facility of placing in position, the horizontal direction is certainly to be preferred; but this is also far removed from the natural position in the animal while in the state of repose. On the other hand, the mind is not satisfied with the idea that certain regions of the face, such as the nose and the forehead, are then directed upwards. And yet it is necessary to come to a decision, seeing that what we are now investigating applies also to the position to which it is necessary to give the preference in placing the skeleton of the head when we wish to draw it in profile. That which we adopt is a compromise, but to us it seems more rational. The position of the head of the horse, to be normal, should be such as to give it an inclination of 45Â°. In this case the lower jaw is still posterior; and, for this reason, we see in adopting this position some inconveniences from a didactic point of view. Accordingly, we will suppose the head brought a little nearer to the horizontal, and this, from the imaginative point of view, has certainly an advantage which we cannot afford to neglect when addressing artists. Indeed, let us suppose that to a clay model of a human head we wish to give the aspect of the head of a quadruped. We should elevate the occiput; and then, taking hold of the lower part of the face, we should lengthen it, not in a direction precisely antero-posterior, but downwards and forwards. It is obviously this latter procedure which, on the other hand, is carried out when a person wishes to give to his own face some resemblance to the muzzle of a quadruped. It is true that, in the position we have adopted, the face is directed obliquely downwards and forwards, and that there may result a certain confusion in describing the position of its different parts. On this account, with the object of not making complications, we purpose, for the present, to substitute, for example, for the term 'antero-superior'--which when speaking of the position of the forehead and nose would be more exact--the term 'anterior,' which is sufficiently comprehensible. The mouth will be, for the same reason, referred to as being situated at the inferior part of the face, and not the antero-inferior. =The Skull.=--The elevation of the cranial region becomes especially appreciable when we examine the occipital bone. Before verifying this fact, it is not superfluous to recall the general arrangement which this bone presents in the human skull. A portion of the occipital bone occupies the base of the skull; but this base in man is horizontal; to this region succeeds the shell-shaped portion of the occipital bone, which, passing vertically upwards, forms with the preceding portion an angle situated at the level of the external occipital protuberance, and of the curved line which starts from it on each side. In animals a portion of the occipital bone is horizontal, it is true; but this bone being sharply bent at the level of the occipital foramen and condyles, the result is that the portion which surmounts these latter looks backwards, and is limited above by the external occipital protuberance, which forms the culminating point of the skull; this point is situated between the ears. [Illustration: FIG. 58.--SKULL OF ONE OF THE FELIDÃ (JAGUAR): LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. 1, Posterior surface of the occipital bone; 2, external occipital protuberance; 3, condyle of the occipital bone; 4, jugular process; 5, parietal bone; 6, frontal bone; 7, orbital process; 8, orbital cavity; 9, squamous portion of the temporal bone; 10, external auditory canal, in front of which is situated the zygomatic process; 11, tympanic bulla; 12, superior maxillary bone; 13, intermaxillary or incisor bone; 14, nasal bone; 15, anterior orifice of the nasal cavity; 16, malar bone; 17, ungual or lachrymal bone; 18, inferior maxillary bone; 19, condyle of the inferior maxillary bone; 20, coronoid process; 21, incisor teeth; 22, canine teeth; 23, molar teeth.] [Illustration: FIG. 59.--SKULL OF THE LION: LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. This figure is intended to show that in the lion the contour of the face between the nasal bones and the cranial region is more flattened than in other felidÃ¦, such as the tiger, jaguar, panther, and domestic cat. This difference is shown by comparison of this figure with the preceding one (Fig. 58). We are indebted to M. Tramond, the well-known naturalist, for the indication of this differential character which, from the artistic plastic point of view, is one of real interest.] This protuberance, prolonged on each side by the superior curved line of the occipital bone, is so much the more prominent as this bone bends sharply a second time, so as to form a third portion, which, looking forwards, forms part of the anterior aspect of the skull, and proceeds to articulate with the parietals. On this third portion is found a crest which, proceeding from the occipital protuberance, is continuous in front with the parietal crests, to which we will again refer in speaking of the parietal bones. On the inferior surface of the human occipital bone are found, at the level of, and external to, the condyles two bony elevations which bear the name of _jugular eminences_. They are long in quadrupeds, and constitute what are designated by some authors the _styloid processes_, but they must not be confounded with the processes of the same name which in the case of man form part of the temporal bone. These processes are very highly developed in the pig, horse, ox, and sheep. In the ox, the occipital bone is deprived of the protuberance, and is not bent on itself in the anterior portion, neither does it form the most salient part of the skull; this latter, which is situated at the level of the horns, belongs to the frontal bone. In the pig, also, the occipital bone is not bent upon itself in its anterior portion, but forms the summit of the head. The occipital protuberance, hollowed on its posterior surface, rises vertically, and rests upon the parietal bone, with which it forms an acute angle. The parietals, two separate bones in the dog and the cat, but fused in the median line in the ox, sheep, and horse, are of special interest in regard to the two crests which, in the carnivora, and also in the pig and the horse, occupy their external surface, and, after diverging from one another, are continued by a crest which crosses the frontal bone and ends at the external orbital process of the latter bone. These crests, known as the _parietal_ or _temporal crests_, recall both in position and relations the temporal curved line of the parietal bone of man. They contribute, as in the case of the latter, to the formation of the boundaries of the temporal fossa. [Illustration: FIG. 60.--SKULL OF THE DOG: LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. 1, Posterior surface of the occipital bone; 2, external occipital protuberance; 3, occipital condyle; 4, jugular process; 5, parietal bone; 6, frontal bone; 7, orbital process; 8, orbital cavity; 9, external auditory canal, in front of which is found the zygomatic process; 10, tympanic bulla; 11, superior maxillary bone; 12, intermaxillary or incisor bone; 13, nasal bone; 14, anterior opening of the cavity of the nasal fossÃ¦; 15, malar bone; 16, lachrymal bone; 17, inferior maxillary bone; 18, condyle of the inferior maxillary bone; 19, coronoid process; 20, incisor teeth; 21, canine teeth; 22, molar teeth.] In the carnivora, these crests are situated, throughout their whole length, in the median line, the temporal fossÃ¦ being, accordingly, as extended as they possibly can be. In certain species, the development of these crests is such that they form by their union a vertical plate, which, in separating the two temporal fossÃ¦, gives them a greater depth. In the pig, the parietal crests, analogous in this respect to the temporal curved lines of the parietal bones of man, are separated by an interval, proportionately less extended, however, than that of the human skull. The parietal bone in the ox and the sheep does not enter into the formation of the anterior surface of the skull; it is formed by an osseous plate, narrow and elongated transversely, which, with the occipital bone, constitutes the base of the region of _the nape of the neck_. It is bent upon itself at the level of its lateral portions so as to occupy the temporal fossa. The anterior surface of the frontal bone, which is depressed in the median line in the dog, but plane in the horse, is limited by two crests, which, situated on the prolongation of the parietal crests, diverge more and more from one another in proportion as they occupy a lower position. This surface terminates externally in two processes, which are the homologues of the external orbital processes of the human frontal bone. The superior border of these orbital processes, situated on the prolongation of the corresponding parietal crests, contributes to limit the temporal fossa. Each of these orbital processes terminates in the following manner: In the bear, dog, cat, and pig, in which the orbital cavities are incompletely bounded by bone, this process, slightly developed, is not in connection, by its inferior extremity, with any other part of the skeleton of the region. In the ox and the sheep, it articulates with a process of the malar bone. In the horse, it articulates with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The inferior margin of this process forms a part of the boundary of the anterior opening of the orbital cavity. The supra-orbital foramen, which does not exist in carnivora, occupies in the horse the base of the orbital process. In the ox, it is situated a little nearer the middle line; and its anterior orifice opens into an osseous gutter which is directed upwards towards the base of the horn, while inferiorly it meets the inferior border of the frontal bone; in the sheep this groove is but slightly developed. In this latter, as in the ox, it is the frontal bone which forms the most elevated portion of the skull. In fact, being bent upon itself at a certain level, its external surface is formed of two planes: one, posterior, which is inclined downwards and directed backwards; the other, anterior, is also inclined downwards, but with a forward obliquity. At the union of these planes the bone forms an elbow, on either side of which are found the osseous processes on which the horns are mounted. [Illustration: FIG. 61.--SKULL OF THE PIG: LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. 1, Occipital bone; 2, condyle of the occipital; 3, jugular process; 4, parietal bone; 5, parietal crests; 6, frontal bone; 7, orbital process; 8, orbital cavity; 9, external auditory canal; 10, zygomatic process; 11, superior maxillary bone; 12, intermaxillary or incisor bone; 13, nasal bone; 14, anterior orifice of the cavity of the nasal fossÃ¦; 15, malar bone; 16, lachrymal bone; 17, inferior maxillary bone; 18, condyle of the inferior maxillary bone; 19, incisor teeth; 20, canine teeth; 21, molar teeth.] In the bear, the anterior margin of the frontal bone is prolonged by two small tongues of bone, which, descending on the lateral borders of the nasal bones, articulate with the superior half of the latter. The temporal bone is, as in man, furnished with a squamous portion, from which springs the zygomatic process, which is directed towards the face, to terminate in the following manner: in the carnivora, the pig, and ruminants, it articulates with the malar bone by its inferior border; in the horse, it insinuates itself as a sort of wedge between the malar bone and the orbital process of the frontal bone, with which it articulates, as we have already pointed out, and contributes, by a portion situated in front of this articulation, to form the boundary of the anterior opening of the corresponding orbital cavity. As in man, the zygomatic process arises by two roots: one, transverse, behind which is situated the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone; the other, antero-posterior, which proceeds to join above with the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Behind the glenoid cavity is found the external auditory canal, and, further back still, the mastoid process. This latter, but slightly developed in the carnivora, a little more so in the ruminants, and still more in the horse, has its external surface traversed by a crest, _the mastoid crest_, which, after becoming blended with the antero-posterior root of the zygomatic process, proceeds with this latter to join the superior occipital curved line. Below the auditory canal is situated a round prominence, highly developed in carnivora; this is _the tympanic bulla_, also called _the mastoid protuberance_; it is an appendage of the tympanum. The Face The bone of this region, around which all the others come to be grouped, is, as in man, the superior maxillary. The relations of this maxillary with the neighbouring bones is not exactly the same in all animals; for example, in the ox, sheep, and horse, in which the bones of the nose are wide in their upper part, and in which the lachrymal bone, which is very highly developed, encroaches on the face, the superior maxillary does not meet the frontal bone; it is separated from it by the above-named bones. It unites with it, on the other hand, in the dog and the cat. In the bear, it is separated from the bones of the nose by a small tongue of bone which springs from the anterior border of the frontal--a process which we have noticed in connection with this latter. [Illustration: FIG. 62.--THE SKULL OF THE OX: LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. 1, Occipital condyle; 2, jugular process; 3, parietal bone; 4, frontal bone; 5, osseous process, which serves to support the horn (horn-core); 6, orbital cavity; 7, external auditory canal, in front of which is found the zygomatic process; 8, temporal fossa; 9, superior maxillary bone; 10, intermaxillary or incisor bone; 11, nasal bone; 12, anterior orifice of the cavity of the nasal fossÃ¦; 13, malar bone; 14, lachrymal bone; 15, inferior maxillary bone; 16, condyle of the inferior maxillary bone; 17, incisor teeth; 18, molar teeth.] In the pig, ox, sheep, and horse, the external surface is traversed, to a greater or less extent, by a crest which is situated on the prolongation of the inferior border of the malar bone. This crest, which is straight in the horse, but curved with its convexity upwards in the ox and the sheep, is known as _the maxillary spine_ or _the malar tuberosity_: it gives attachment to the masseter muscle, and, in the horse, is distinctly visible under the skin. It does not exist in the carnivora. On the same surface is situated the sub-orbital foramen. The inferior border is hollowed out into alveoli, in which are implanted the superior molar and canine teeth. This border is prolonged forwards from the alveolus, which corresponds to the first molar tooth, to terminate, after a course more or less prolonged, at the alveolus of the canine. This space, more or less considerably expanded, which thus separates these teeth is called the _interdental space_; but this denomination is not applicable to ruminants, because these latter possess neither canine nor incisor teeth in the upper jaw (see p. 125, dentition of the ox and sheep). The superior maxillary bone of one side and that of the opposite side do not meet in the median line in the region which corresponds to the incisor teeth; they are separated by a bone which, in the human species, is present only at the commencement of life, and afterwards coalesces with the maxilla; this is the intermaxillary or incisor bone. This bone, which is paired, is formed of a central part, which bears the superior incisor teeth; it is prolonged upwards and backwards by two processes: one, external, which insinuates itself between the superior maxillary and the nasal bone, except in the sheep, in which it remains widely separated from the latter; the other, internal, which is united to that which belongs to the bone of the opposite side to form part of the floor of the cavity of the nasal fossÃ¦; the external border of this process, which is separated from the body of the bone by a notch, forms the internal boundary of the corresponding _incisor opening_ or the _incisor slit_. Owing to the absence of superior incisors in ruminants, the intermaxillary bone presents no alveoli. The malar bone, and the os unguis or lachrymal, are more or less developed according to the species considered. With regard to the malar bone, it is most important to notice the part which it takes in the formation of the zygomatic arch, and that its inferior border contributes to form the crest to which is attached the masseter muscle. As for the nasal bones, they present differential characters which, as they affect the form of the region which they occupy, are worthy of notice. [Illustration: FIG. 63.--SKULL OF THE HORSE: LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. 1, Posterior surface of the occipital bone; 2, external occipital protuberance; 3, occipital condyle; 4, jugular process; 5, parietal bone; 6, frontal bone; 7, orbital cavity; 8, zygomatic process of the temporal bone; 9, external auditory canal; 10, mastoid process; 11, superior maxillary bone or _maxilla_; 12, intermaxillary or incisor bone; 13, nasal bone; 14, anterior orifice of the cavity of the nasal fossÃ¦; 14Â´, malar bone; 15, lachrymal bone; 16, inferior maxillary bone or _mandible_; 17, inferior maxillary fissure; 18, condyle of the inferior maxillary bone; 19, coronoid process of the inferior maxillary bone; 20, incisor teeth; 21, canine teeth; 22, molar teeth.] Their dimensions in length are proportional to those of the face. Very small in man, they are more developed in carnivora. We recognise in the latter the two curves which characterize them in the human species, and which we clearly notice when we view them on one of their lateral aspects: a concavity above, and a convexity below. These curves are more or less accentuated--very strongly marked in the bulldog, and scarcely at all in the greyhound. Moreover, in the carnivora also the nasal bones are wider below than above, and form, by their junction, a semicircular notch which limits, in its superior portion, the anterior opening of the cavity of the nasal fossÃ¦. In the horse they present an opposite arrangement with regard to their dimensions in width; broad above, each terminates below by forming a pointed process which, separated from the intermaxillary bones, is prolonged in front of the nasal orifice. The inferior maxillary bone is, as in man, formed of a body and two branches. But among the many special characteristics of form and size which sharply differentiate it from the human bone, one detail must be indicated; this is the absence of a mental prominence. Hence it results that the anterior border of the body of the lower jaw, instead of being directed obliquely downwards and forwards, is, on the contrary, oblique downwards and backwards, and that in certain animals this border is actually found almost exactly on the prolongation of the inferior border of the body of the bone. On the external surface of the body are found the three mental foramina. The superior border is hollowed out by alveoli. With regard to the branches (_rami_), they terminate in two processes: one, the posterior, is the condyle; the other, situated more forwards, is the coronoid process, which gives insertion to the temporal muscle. These two processes are separated by the sigmoid notch. For reasons which we will explain further on (see p. 127, movements of the lower jaw), the condyle presents differences of form. In the carnivora, it is strongly convex from before backwards, expanded transversely, and firmly mortised in the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone; in the ruminants, it is less convex from before backwards, it is more slightly concave in the transverse direction; in the rodents--we give as an example the hare (Fig. 64)--the condyle is still convex from before backwards, but it is flattened from without inwards. In the animals in which the muscles of mastication are very highly developed, and especially in the carnivora, the osseous regions occupied by these muscles are more extensive and more deep than in the human species. The length of the coronoid process, the depth of the temporal fossa, the extent of the zygomatic arch, the appearance of the external surface of each of the rami of the lower jaw, deeply hollowed out for accommodation of the masseter, and to provide extensive surfaces of insertion for this muscle, are sure proofs furnished by the skeleton of the occasionally enormous development of the muscles of mastication. In the carnivora, a rather strong process, which is directed backwards, occupies the angle of the inferior maxilla; it is, accordingly, situated below the region of the condyle. [Illustration: FIG. 64.--SKULL OF THE HARE: LEFT LATERAL ASPECT. 1, External occipital protuberance; 2, occipital condyle; 3, parietal bone; 4, frontal bone; 5, orbital process; 6, orbital cavity; 7, zygomatic process; 8, external auditory canal; 9, superior maxillary bone; 10, intermaxillary or incisor bone; 11, nasal bone; 12, anterior opening of the nasal fossa; 13, malar bone; 14, inferior maxillary bone; 15, condyle of the inferior maxillary bone; 16, incisor teeth; 17, molar teeth.] The teeth which the jaws carry vary in number, and even in appearance, according to species; it is useful to note their differences. In order to establish the nature of these latter more effectively, we will first recall the fact that in man the teeth, thirty-two in number, are equally distributed between the jaws, and are divided into incisors, canines, and molars, of which the arrangement is thus formulated: 5_m._ 1_c._ 2_i._ | 2_i._ 1_c._ 5_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 32.[19] 5_m._ 1_c._ 2_i._ | 2_i._ 1_c._ 5_m._ [19] _I.e._, _i_, incisors; _c_, canines; _m_, molars. We also note that the incisors are edged, the canines are pointed, and that the molars, cubical in shape, have their surface of contact provided with tubercles. The teeth of the cat are thirty in number; they are thus arranged: 4_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 4_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 30. 3_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 3_m._ Those of the dog number forty-two: 6_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 6_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 42. 7_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 7_m._ In these animals, the incisors, such as are not damaged by use, are furnished, on the free border of their crown, with three tubercles, of which one, the median, is more developed than those which are situated laterally. We denote these teeth, commencing with those nearest the median line, by the names _central incisors_ or _nippers_, _intermediate_ and _corner incisors_. The canines, or _fangs_, are long and conical; they are curved backwards and outwards. The upper canines, which are larger than those of the lower jaw, are separated from the most external of the incisors (_corner_) by an interval in which the canines of the lower jaw are received. The lower canines, on the other hand, are in contact with the neighbouring incisors, and are each separated from the first molar which succeeds them by a wider interval than that which is situated between the corresponding teeth in the upper jaw. The molars differ essentially from the teeth of the same class in the human species. Their crown terminates in a cutting border bristling with sharp-pointed projections; this formation indicates that these teeth are principally designed for tearing. During the movement of raising the lower jaw, which is so energetic in the carnivora, they act, indeed, in the same manner as the two blades of a pair of scissors. The largest molars are: in the dog, the fourth of the upper jaw, and the fifth in the opposite one; in the cat, the third both above and below. The pig has forty-four teeth disposed in the following manner: 7_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 7_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 44. 7_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 7_m._ Of the incisors, the nippers and the intermediate ones of the upper jaw have their analogues in those of the horse; in the lower jaw, the corresponding teeth, straight, and directed forward, rather resemble the same incisors in rodents. The corner incisor teeth are much smaller, and are separated from the neighbouring teeth. The canine teeth, also called _tusks_ or _tushes_, are greatly developed, especially in the male. The molars increase in size from the first to the last; they are not cutting, as in the carnivora, but they are not flattened and provided with tubercles on their surfaces of contact as in the herbivora. In the ox and the sheep the teeth are thirty-two in number: 6_m._ 0_c._ 0_i._ | 0_i._ 0_c._ 6_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 32. 6_m._ 0_c._ 4_i._ | 4_i._ 0_c._ 6_m._ As we see from this dental formula, the incisors are found only in the lower jaw; they are replaced in the upper jaw by a thick cartilaginous pad on which the inferior incisors find a surface of resistance. These have their crowns flattened from above downwards, and gradually become thinner from the root to the anterior border, which is edged and slightly convex. These teeth gradually wear away. In proportion to the progress of this wear, on account of the fact that it involves the anterior borders and upper surfaces of the incisor teeth, and that these teeth are narrower towards the root than at the opposite extremity, the intervals which separate them tend to become wider and wider; and when the roots become exposed by the retraction of the gums, they are then separated from one another by a considerable interval. The molars have their grinding surface comparable to that of the horse; they increase in size from the first to the sixth. The teeth of the horse are forty in number; they are thus distributed: 6_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 6_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 40. 6_m._ 1_c._ 3_i._ | 3_i._ 1_c._ 6_m._ As they become worn, these teeth continue to grow, and as, on the one hand, this phenomenon takes place throughout the whole life of the animal, and, on the other hand, the process of wear brings out and makes visible at the surface of friction parts formerly deeper and deeper, and of which the configuration varies at different levels, there result special features which permit the determination of the age of the animal by an examination of its jaws. The incisors are called, commencing with those situated nearest the middle line, _central incisors_ or _nippers_, _intermediate_ and _corner incisors_. The canines, also designated as the _fangs_, exist only in the male. It is exceptional to find them in the mare, and when they exist in this latter they are less developed than those of the horse. The molars have cuboid crowns; the surface of friction is almost square in the case of the upper molars, and is inclined so as to look inwards; in the case of the inferior ones, it is a little narrowed, and is inclined so as to look outwards. In the upper jaw the external surface of the crown is hollowed by two longitudinal furrows; in the lower jaw the same surface has only one furrow, which at times is but slightly marked. In the hare the teeth are twenty-eight in number: 6_m._ 0_c._ 2_i._ | 2_i._ 0_c._ 6_m._ --------------------+-------------------- = 28. 5_m._ 0_c._ 1_i._ | 1_i._ 0_c._ 5_m._ The four incisors of the upper jaw are divided into two groups; one of these is formed by the two principal teeth, the other by two very small incisors which are placed behind the preceding. Having studied the jaws and examined the arrangement of the teeth, we should say a few words on the movements which the lower jaw is able to execute. In man, these movements are varied in character: the jaw is lowered and raised; it can also be projected forwards and drawn backwards, or carried to the right or left side by lateral movements. Owing to the different modes of nutrition of animals, with which the shape of the teeth is clearly correlated, being more specialized than in the human species, the lower jaw is moved in a fashion less varied and in the direction most suitable for the mastication of the foods which form the aliment of the species considered. Moreover, this is plainly shown in the skeleton by the shape of the condyle of the lower jaw (see p. 122, different forms of this condyle). In the carnivora, whose teeth, as we have seen, are all cutting ones, the jaw rises and falls; the food then is, if we consider the two jaws, cut as by the blades of a pair of scissors. In the ruminants, the incisors exist only in the lower jaw, but the molars are thick and well developed; the food is ground by these latter as by millstones, and the movements which favour this action are, above all, the lateral. As for the rodents, in which the incisors are formed for filing down and cutting through hard resisting bodies, their lower jaw moves in the antero-posterior direction, in such a way that the inferior incisors alternately advance and recede beneath those of the upper jaw. The free cutting border of these teeth effectively fulfils the function to which they are destined; their constant wear preserves and revivifies the chisel edge which characterizes them, without leading to their destruction, for the incisors in rodents are of continuous growth. THE SKULL OF BIRDS =The Skull of Birds= (Fig. 65).--If, because it is less important from the artistic point of view, we do not consider it necessary to describe in detail the skull of birds, we yet think it useful to indicate, in their general lines, the peculiarities it presents. In this group the skull is generally pear-shaped; to the cranium, of which the bones are arranged in such a way as to give it a form more or less spherical, succeeds a face more or less elongated, according as the bill is more or less developed. In general, the bones of the skull coalesce very early, with the result that it is only in very young individuals that we can determine their presence. We find the skull to consist of an occipital bone, two parietals, a frontal, etc.; we will indicate but one detail in connection with these bones: it is the presence of a single condyle for the articulation of the occipital bone with the atlas. We also note the quadrate bone, which is situated on the lateral part of the cranium, is movable on this latter, and acts as an intermediary between it, the bones of the face, and the lower jaw. The quadrate bone is regarded as a detached portion of the temporal; on the signification of this we do not now propose to dwell. [Illustration: FIG. 65.--SKULL OF THE COCK: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE. 1, Occipital bone; 2, parietal bone; 3, frontal bone; 4, ethmoid bone; 5, cavity of the tympanum; 6, quadrate bone; 7, superior maxillary bone; 8, malar bone; 9, nasal bone; 10, 10, intermaxillary bone; 11, nasal orifice; 12, os unguis or lachrymal bone; 13, inferior maxillary bone.] On the anterior portion of the face we find the nasal bones, which, articulating with the frontal on one side, circumscribe, on the other, the posterior border of the nares. The nasal bone of the one side is separated from that of the opposite by the intermaxillary or premaxillary bone, which forms the skeleton of the superior mandible. The superior maxillaries, which are rudimentary, are situated on the lateral parts, and prolonged backward by an osseous style which articulates with the quadrate bone; this styloid bone, the homologue of the malar, is designated by certain authors as the _jugal_ or _quadrato-jugal_ bone. It is with the quadrate bone also that the inferior maxillary articulates. CHAPTER II MYOLOGY The first point to decide in commencing this study is the order in which we shall consider the different muscles which we have to examine. It must not be forgotten that in the present work we compare the organization of animals with that of man, which we already know, and that it is on the construction of this latter that, in these studies, the thought must at each instant be carried back in order to establish this comparison. Now, the general tendency which we notice in our teaching of anatomy, when one regards the region of the trunk in the human figure (a living model or a figure in the round), is first to consider the anterior aspect. It is the latter that, for this reason, we study at the very beginning; we next deal with the posterior surface of the trunk, because it is opposite; lastly, the lateral surfaces, because they unite with the preceding surfaces, the one to the other. In studying an animal, it is usually by one of its lateral aspects that one first observes it; it is, in fact, by these aspects that it presents its greatest dimensions, and that the morphological characters as a whole can be more readily appreciated. Hence, possibly, the order of description adopted in most texts, or in the figures which accompany them. The first representation of the human figure as a whole, in a treatise on anatomy, represents the anterior aspect; the first view of the horse as a whole, in a treatise on veterinary anatomy, for example, is, on the other hand, a lateral view. We break with this latter custom, and, without taking into account the tendency above indicated, we will commence our analysis with the study of the aspect of the trunk, which corresponds to the anterior aspect of the same region in man. The first muscles usually presented for study to artists being the pectorals, it is their homologues that we will first describe here. We will afterwards describe the abdominal region, then the muscles which occupy the dorsal aspect of the trunk. With regard to the lateral surfaces, they will be found, by this fact alone, almost completely studied, since the muscles of the two preceding (back and abdomen), spreading out, so to speak, over them, contribute to their formation. Nothing further will remain but to incorporate with them the muscles of the shoulder; but these will be studied in connection with the anterior limbs, from which they cannot be separated. The neck, in man, may be considered in an isolated fashion, because, on account of its narrowness in proportion to the width of the shoulders, it is clearly differentiated from the trunk; for this reason we combine the study of it with that of the head. In animals, because of the absence or slight development of the clavicles, the neck is generally too much confounded with the region of the shoulders to make it legitimate to separate it from that region in too marked a fashion. It will, accordingly, be considered next. We will then undertake the study of the muscles of the limbs, and end with the myology of the head. THE MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK We shall divide them into muscles of the thorax, of the abdomen, and of the back. Muscles of the Thorax =The Pectoralis Major= (Fig. 66, 1, 2; Fig. 67, 3, 4; Fig. 68, 7; Fig. 69, 10; Fig. 70, 11).--Further designated by the name of _superficial pectoral_, this muscle is described in treatises on veterinary anatomy as formed of two portions: an anterior one, called the _sterno-humeral_ muscle; the other, situated below and behind the preceding, bearing the name of _sterno-aponeurotic_. It occupies the region of the breast, and, as a whole, it takes origin from the median portion of the sternum, from which it is directed towards the arm and forearm. The anterior portion (sterno-humeral muscle)--thick, forming an elevation under the skin, and really constituting the pectoral region--is directed downwards and outwards to be inserted into the anterior margin of the humerus--that is to say, to the ridge which limits in front the spiral groove of this bone. The other part (sterno-aponeurotic muscle) is situated more posteriorly, and corresponds to the region known in veterinary anatomy as the _inter-fore-limb space_, which is limited laterally on each side by the superior portion of the forearm, of which the point of junction with the trunk bears the name _ars_. Arising from the sternum, as we have above indicated, this portion is directed outwards, to be joined with the terminal aponeurosis of the sterno-humeral, and with that which covers the internal surface of the forearm. All things considered, the sterno-humeral muscle may be regarded as the representative of the upper fibres of the great pectoral of man, of which the attachments, owing to the more or less complete absence of the clavicle in the domestic mammals, the fibres must be concentrated on the sternum; the sterno-aponeurotic portion then representing the inferior fasciculÃ¦ of the same muscle. [Illustration: FIG. 66.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: ANTERIOR ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 1, Pectoralis major (sterno-humeral); 2, pectoralis major (sterno-aponeurotic); 3, mastoido-humeralis; 4, point of the shoulder; 5, sterno-mastoid or sterno-maxillary: 6, inferior portion of the platysma myoides of the neck, divided; 7, triceps cubiti; 8, brachialis anticus; 9, radialis (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 10, scapular region.] The great pectoral muscle of one side is separated from that of the opposite side along the median line, and especially above and in front, by a groove which is more or less deep, according as the muscles are more or less developed. At the bottom of this groove, suggestive of that which exists in the corresponding region in man, is found, as in this latter, the median portion of the sternum. The preceding description particularly applies to the arrangement which the great pectoral presents in the horse; in other animals it is marked by some distinctive characters. In the pig, it is inserted into the sternum as far only as the level of the third costal cartilage; in the ox and sheep, it extends as far as the sixth; in the dog, it is attached to the two first sternal pieces only--that is to say, as far as the third costal cartilage. Moreover, in the latter, as in the cat, the two portions which we have indicated are less readily distinguished. The great pectoral, by its contraction, draws the fore-limb towards the middle line--that is to say, adducts it. =The Pectoralis Minor= (Fig. 67, 6; Fig. 68, 8; Fig. 69, 11; Fig. 70, 12, 26).--This muscle, also called the _deep pectoral_, is, in animals, larger than the superficial pectoral, therefore certain authors prefer to give to this muscle and the preceding one the names of deep and superficial pectoral respectively. This nomenclature is evidently legitimate, and conforms more to reality, since it does not bring in the notion of dimensions which here is found in contradiction to nomenclature; but, in order to establish more clearly the parallelism with the corresponding muscles in man, we think it better, nevertheless, to give them the names by which it has been customary to designate them in connection with the latter. We will recall at the outset that the lesser pectoral muscle in man is completely covered by the great. In animals this is not the case; the lesser pectoral being very highly developed, projects beyond the great pectoral posteriorly, and occupies to a greater or less extent the inferior surface of the abdomen. It also consists of two parts: one anterior, which we designate by the name of _sterno-prescapular_; the other, posterior, bearing that of _sterno-humeral_.[20] [20] This division of the pectorals certainly complicates the nomenclature of these muscles; nevertheless, it introduces no insuperable difficulty from the mnemonic point of view. But where the study becomes less profitable, and comparison with the corresponding muscles in man more complicated, is in adopting the nomenclature of Bourgelat. Indeed, the great pectoral is designated by this author the 'common muscle of the arm and forearm,' while the lesser pectoral (or deep pectoral) is called the 'great pectoral' in its sterno-trochinian and 'lesser pectoral' in its sterno-prescapular portion. We do not consider it necessary to give the other theories relative to the homologies of these, notwithstanding the very real interest which they present from the purely anatomical point of view, as they have but few applications in the study of forms. The sterno-prescapular muscle, being covered by the sterno-humeral, has little interest for us. It arises from the sternum, and is directed towards the angle formed by the junction of the scapula and humerus; then it is reflected upwards and backwards, to terminate on the anterior margin of the shoulder by insertion into the aponeurosis, which covers the supraspinatus muscle. We can, especially in the horse after removal of the skin, recognise it, at the level of this region, in the interspace limited by the superficial muscles (Fig. 70, 26). In the dog and cat this portion of the muscle does not exist. The other division of the muscle, the sterno-trochinian, is more interesting. It arises from the abdominal aponeurosis and the posterior part of the sternum; hence it passes forward, turns under the superficial pectoral, and is inserted into the lesser tuberosity (trochin) of the humerus. In the pig, dog, and cat, it is inserted into the greater tuberosity (trochiter) of the bone of the arm. The superior border of this muscle is in relation with a superficial vein, which is distinctly visible in the horse--the subcutaneous thoracic vein, which in this animal is called the vein of the spur. The sterno-humeral muscle, in contracting, draws the shoulder and the whole anterior limb backwards. =Serratus Magnus= (Fig. 67, 2; Fig. 69, 8; Fig. 70, 9).--This muscle, which is situated on the lateral aspect of the thorax, is covered to a considerable extent by the shoulder, the posterior muscular mass of the arm, and by the great dorsal muscle. It arises by digitations from the external surface of the dorsal vertebrÃ¦; from the first eight in the horse, ox, and dog. [Illustration: FIG. 67.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: INFERIOR ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 1, Anterior extremity of the sternum; 2, point of the shoulder and inferior portion of the mastoido-humeral muscle; 3, pectoralis major (sterno-humeral); 4, pectoralis major (sterno-aponeurotic); 5, point of the elbow; 6, pectoralis minor (sterno-trochinian); 7, serratus magnus; 8, external oblique; 9, sheath of the rectus abdominis; 10, linea alba; 11, the umbilicus; 12, external oblique divided in order to expose the rectus abdominis; 13, rectus abdominis.] The muscular bundles, converging as they proceed, towards the scapula, pass under this bone, to be inserted into the superior portion of the subscapular fossa, near the spinal border. The inferior portion of its posterior digitations is visible in the ox and in the horse; these digitations are less visible in the pig. They are not seen at all in the dog (Fig. 68) or cat, for in these animals the great dorsal muscle covers them completely. The great serratus muscle, by the position which it occupies and the arrangement that it presents, forms with the corresponding muscle of the opposite side a sort of girth, which supports the thorax, and at the same time helps to fix the scapula against the latter. When it contracts, in taking its fixed point at the ribs, it draws the superior portion of the scapula downwards and backwards in such a way that this bone has its inferior angle directed forwards and upwards. If it takes its fixed point at the shoulder, it then acts on the ribs, raises them, and so becomes a muscle of inspiration. Because of the connections of the serratus magnus with the levator anguli scapulÃ¦, some authors consider it as united with the latter. But as the latter muscle is visible only in the region of the neck (see p. 157), and as it is separately described in man, we prefer to distinguish them from one another. We shall recall the connections to which we have just made allusion when describing the cervical region. Muscles of the Abdomen The abdominal wall is, as in man, formed by four large muscles: the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversalis, which form the lateral walls, and the rectus abdominis, situated on each side of the middle line of the abdomen. This latter, because of the general direction of the trunk in quadrupeds, has its superficial surface directed downwards. The arrangement of these muscles closely corresponds to that which we find in the human species. =The External Oblique Muscle= (Fig. 67, 8, 12; Fig. 68, 5; Fig. 69, 9; Fig. 70, 10).--This muscle arises, by digitations, from a number of ribs, which varies according to the species, the number of the ribs being itself variable for each of them, as we pointed out in connection with the osteology of the thorax. Indeed, the great oblique arises from the eight or nine posterior ribs in the dog and the ox, and from the thirteen or fourteen posterior in the horse. It is attached, besides, to the dorso-lumbar aponeurosis. These attachments are arranged in a line directed obliquely upwards and backwards, and the first digitations--that is to say, the most anterior ones--dovetail with the posterior digitations of origin of the great serratus muscle. The fleshy fibres are directed downwards and backwards, and terminate in an aponeurosis which covers the inferior aspect of the abdomen, and proceeds to form the linea alba by joining with that of the muscle of the opposite side, and also to be inserted into the crural arch. This aponeurosis of the external oblique is covered by an expansion of elastic fibrous tissue, which doubles it externally, and which is known as the _abdominal tunic_. This latter is further developed as the organs of the digestive apparatus are more voluminous, and their weight, consequently, more considerable. For this reason, in the large herbivora, as the ox and the horse, this tunic is extremely thick, whereas in the pig, cat, and dog it is, on the contrary, reduced to a simple membrane. Indeed, in these latter, the abdominal viscera being less developed, the inferior wall of the abdomen does not require so strong a fibrous apparatus for supporting them. The great oblique, when it contracts, compresses the abdominal viscera in all circumstances under which this compression is necessary; it also acts as a flexor of the vertebral column. =The Internal Oblique Muscle.=--This muscle, which is covered by the preceding, arises from the anterior superior iliac spine (external angle in ruminants and solipeds) and the neighbouring parts. From this origin its muscular fibres, the general direction of which is opposite to that of the fibres of the external oblique, diverging, proceed to terminate in an aponeurosis, which contributes to the formation of the _linea alba_, and to be attached superiorly to the internal surface of the last costal cartilages. It has the same action as the great oblique. What it presents of special interest is the detail of form which it determines in the region of the flank; this detail is _the cord of the flank_. It is characterized by an elongated prominence which, starting from the iliac spine, is directed obliquely downwards and forwards, to terminate near the cartilaginous border of the false ribs. Often very apparent in the ox, and still more so in the cow, the cord in question contrasts with the depression which surmounts it; this depression is situated below the costiform processes of the lumbar vertebrÃ¦, and is called the _hollow of the flank_. It is so much the more marked as the mass of the intestinal viscera is of greater weight. We sometimes meet with a case of the presence of this hollow in the horse. But when in the latter, the flank is well formed, the hollow is scarcely visible, and the cord but slightly prominent. It is only in emaciated subjects that these details are found clearly marked. =Transversalis Abdominis.=--This muscle being deeply situated does not present any interest for us. We will, however, point out, in order to complete the series of muscles which form the abdominal wall, that the direction of its fibres is transverse, and that they extend from the internal surface of the cartilages of the false ribs, and the costiform processes of the lumbar vertebrÃ¦ to the _linea alba_. =The Rectus Abdominis= (Fig. 67, 13; Fig. 68, 6).--This muscle, enclosed, as it is in man, in a fibrous sheath (Fig. 67, 9) formed by the aponeuroses of the lateral muscles of the abdomen, is a long and wide fleshy band, which, as in the human species, reaches from the thorax to the pubis. What distinguishes it in quadrupeds is that there are costal attachments which extend further on the sternal surface of the thorax, and the number of its aponeurotic insertions, which, in general, is more considerable. These are, indeed, six or seven in number in the pig and in ruminants, and about ten in the horse. It is true that we may find but three in the cat and dog; still, we often find as many as six. These intersections are not marked on their exterior by transverse grooves, such as we find in the human species in individuals with delicate skin and whose adipose tissue is not very much developed. The rectus abdominis is covered, in its anterior portion, by the sterno-trochinian muscle (posterior segment of the small pectoral). In contracting, this muscle brings the chest nearer the pelvis, and as a result flexes the vertebral column. It also contributes to the compression of the abdominal viscera. =Pyramidalis Abdominis.=--This unimportant little muscle, which in man is situated at the lower part of the abdomen, extends from the pubis to the _linea alba_. It is not present in the domestic animals. We consider it interesting, however, to point out, although the fact is not a very useful one as regards external form, that this muscle is distinctly developed in marsupials. We know that in the opossum, the kangaroo, and the phalanger fox, the young are brought forth in an entirely incomplete state of development, and that, during a certain period, they are obliged to lodge in a pouch which is placed at the lower part of the abdomen of the mother. Now, this pouch contains the mammary glands; but the young, being too feeble to exercise the requisite suction, the pyramidal muscles come to their assistance. These muscles, in contracting, approximate to one another two bones which are placed above the pubis, the (so-called) marsupial bones (see Fig. 80); by their approximation the bones in question, which are placed behind and on the outer side of the mammary glands, compress the latter, and thus is brought about the result which the little ones, on account of their feebleness, would, without that intervention, be incapable of obtaining for themselves. Muscles of the Back =Trapezius= (Fig. 68, 1, 2; Fig. 69, 1, 2; Fig. 70, 1, 2).--This muscle, more or less well developed, according to the species, is divided into two portions, of which the names indicate the respective situations--a cervical and a dorsal. These two parts, considered in the order in which we find them, take their origin from the superior cervical ligament and from the spinous processes of the first dorsal vertebrÃ¦. From these different points the fibres are directed towards the shoulder; the anterior are, consequently, oblique downwards and backwards, and the posterior are directed downwards and forwards. They are inserted into the scapula in the following manner: the fibres of the dorsal portion are attached to the tuberosity of the spine; those of the cervical region are also fixed into the same spine, but into a considerably larger surface. The cervical portion occupies, in the region of the neck, an area relatively smaller than the corresponding portion of the trapezius in man. This diminished degree of development results from the absence, complete, or nearly so, of the clavicle in the animals which we are now considering. We remember, that the trapezius of man is partly inserted into the clavicle, and the disappearance of this latter cannot fail to bring modifications in the general disposition of the corresponding portion of the muscle. There results a disconnection of this latter, and it becomes united to other muscular fibres to form a muscle with which we shall soon have to deal--the mastoido-humeral (see p. 150). As specific differences we should add that the trapezius occupies a more or less extensive portion of the median and superior regions of the neck; terminating at a considerable distance from the head in the dog and horse, it, on the contrary, approaches it in the pig and in ruminants. The cervical portion, when it contracts, draws the scapula upwards and forwards, the dorsal portion draws it upwards and backwards. When the trapezius acts as a whole the scapula is raised.

Its fleshy fibres are directed downwards and forwards, being more oblique in direction posteriorly, and pass on the inner side of the posterior muscular mass of the arm, to be inserted into the internal lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus, or, a little lower down, on the median portion of the internal surface of the same bone. This latter mode of insertion is met with in the horse and the ox. The anterior fibres cover the posterior angle of the scapula (as in man, where the corresponding angle, but in this case inferior, is covered by the same muscle), and, a little higher up, are in their turn concealed by a portion of the dorsal fibres of the trapezius. It covers, to a greater or less extent, the great serratus muscle. These relations are similar to those found in the human species. We find that the fleshy fibres of the great dorsal are prolonged more or less backwards if we examine this muscle in the dog, the ox, the pig, and the horse. Indeed, the fibres reach to the thirteenth rib in the dog and the cat (that is to say, the last rib), the eleventh in the ox, tenth in the pig, and twelfth only in the horse. We say 'only' in connection with this last because it is necessary to remember that the ribs are eighteen in number on each side of the thorax of this animal, and that, accordingly, the fleshy fibres of the great dorsal muscle are, relatively, of small extent. When this muscle contracts it flexes the humerus upon the scapula, and helps to draw the whole of the anterior limb backwards and upwards. There is a muscular fasciculus which, because of its relations with the muscle we have just been studying, is known as the _supplementary muscle of the latissimus dorsi_. But as, on the other hand, this fasciculus is in relation with the triceps, we shall in preference consider it in relation with this latter (see p. 173).

It would be superfluous to enter here into a detailed examination of these muscles. If they are but little developed the spinous processes become prominent under the skin; if they are more so they may by their thickness project beyond the level of these processes, and these latter thus come to lie in a groove more or less marked, which, on account of the division which is determined by its presence, has caused the regions which it occupies to be designated by the names _double back_ and _double loins_. The muscles are extensors of the vertebral column. Under the aponeurosis of the great dorsal muscle there is found in man another muscle, the serratus posticus inferior, which, on account of being deeply placed and its slight thickness, offers nothing of interest in connection with the study of external form. It arises from the spinous processes of the three last dorsal vertebrÃ¦ and those of the three first lumbar; it then passes upwards and outwards, and divides into four digitations, to be inserted into the inferior borders of the four last ribs. We repeat that it is covered by the great dorsal muscle. In the pig, ox, and horse, which have this latter muscle less developed in its posterior portion, the same small serratus muscle, known as the _posterior serratus_, is visible in the superficial layer of muscles (Fig. 69, 6; Fig. 70, 6). The number of its digitations is more or less considerable according to the species examined. =The Rhomboid Muscle= (Fig. 70, 21).--In order to make intelligible the position of the rhomboid in the superficial layer in quadrupeds, it appears to us necessary to recall the anatomical characters of the muscle as found in man. The rhomboid arises from the inferior portion of the posterior cervical ligament, from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebrÃ¦ and the four or five upper dorsal; thence passing obliquely downwards and outwards, it is inserted into the spinal border of the scapula, into the portion of this border which is situated below the spine; it sometimes extends to the middle of the interval which separates this latter from the superior internal angle of the same bone. The portion of the muscle which arises from the cervical ligament and the seventh cervical vertebra is often separated from the lower portion by a cellular interspace. For this cause some anatomists have described the rhomboid as consisting of two parts--the superior or small rhomboid and the inferior or large rhomboid, on account of the position occupied by each, and of their difference in volume. This muscle can only be seen in the region of the back, in the space limited externally by the spinal border of the scapula, below by the latissimus dorsi, and internally by the trapezius, which covers it in the rest of its extent. It is not in this space that it is seen in certain quadrupeds. As we pointed out in the section on osteology, the spinal border of the scapula is short, and it seems to be due to this limitation in length that the trapezius and the latissimus dorsi muscle are, at this level, in contact the one with the other in such a way that they fill up the interval in which the rhomboid is seen in man. In the horse we can partly see it in the superficial muscular layer, but in the region of the neck only, at the superior border of the shoulder. Indeed, as we have already pointed out, the trapezius does not reach the occipital protuberance; for this reason a part of the anterior portion of the rhomboid may be seen--that is, the portion which corresponds to the superior part of the human muscle. But whether it be covered by the trapezius, or, as we find in the cat and dog, by the _mastoido-humeral muscle_ (see p. 150), which is very broad in this region, we do not the less recognise its presence; and in the horse and ox, in particular, it forms an elongated prominence beginning at the level of the scapula, and tapering as it ascends, towards the posterior part of the head. [Illustration: FIG. 70.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: SUPERFICIAL LAYER OF MUSCLES. 1, Trapezius, cervical portion; 2, trapezius, dorsal portion; 3, superior outline of the scapula; 4, spine of the scapula; 5, latissimus dorsi muscle; 6, small posterior serratus; 7, spinal muscles, or common muscular mass; 8, ribs; 9, serratus magnus; 10, external oblique; 11, pectoralis major (sterno-humeral); 12, pectoralis minor (sterno-trochinian); 13, atlas; 14, parotid gland; 15, mastoido-humeralis; 16, point of the arm; 17, sterno-mastoid, or sterno-maxillary; 18, jugular groove; 19, infrahyoid muscles; 20, omo-trachelian muscle; 21, rhomboid; 22, splenius; 23, levator anguli scapulÃ¦; 24, deltoid; 25, supraspinatus; 26, terminal part of the sterno-prescapular, a portion of the small pectoral muscle; 27, brachialis anticus; 28, triceps cubiti, middle or long head; 29, triceps cubiti, external head; 30, olecranon; 31, radial extensor (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 32, anterior iliac spine; 33, anterior portion of the gluteus maximus--the aponeurosis of the muscle has been divided in order to expose the gluteus medius; 34, posterior portion of the gluteus maximus; 35, gluteus medius; 36, biceps cruris; 37, semitendinosus; 38, point of the buttock; 39, gastrocnemius; 40, tensor of the fascia lata; 41, triceps cruris; 42, ischio-coccygeal muscle; 43, superior sacro-coccygeal; 44, lateral sacro-coccygeal; 45, inferior sacro-coccygeal.] Its origins are similar to those which we have already described in the human rhomboid. It arises from the cervical ligament and the spinous processes of the foremost dorsal vertebrÃ¦; its fibres converge and pass to the scapula, to be inserted into its superior or spinal border, or into the internal surface of the cartilage of prolongation. It assists in keeping the scapula applied to the thoracic cage, and when it contracts, draws the scapula upwards and forwards. Taking its fixed point at the scapula, it acts on the neck by its anterior fibres, and extends it. We shall soon have occasion to mention this muscle again, in connection with the study of the muscles of the neck. =The Cutaneous Muscle of the Trunk= (Fig. 71).--Immediately beneath the skin which covers the neck, shoulders, and trunk is found a vast cutaneous muscle, analogous to that which, in the human species, exists only in the cervical region. This thin muscle, whose function is to move the skin which strongly adheres to it, and in this way to remove from it material causes of irritation (insects, for example), is of considerable thickness in the region of the trunk; where it constitutes what certain authors have designated by the name of _panniculus carnosus_. In this region it extends from the posterior border of the shoulder to the thigh, and, in the vertical direction, from the apices of the spinous process of the dorso-lumbar vertebrÃ¦ to the median line of the abdomen. Arising above from the supraspinous ligament of the dorso-lumbar and sacral regions (except in the carnivora; see below) by an aponeurosis which, posteriorly, covers the muscles of the hind-limbs, its fibres are directed to the elbow, on which they are arranged in two layers: a superficial, which becomes continuous with the panniculus muscle of the shoulder; and a deep, which passes on the inner side of the shoulder to be inserted into the internal surface of the humerus; this latter exists only in the dog and cat. The most inferior fibres, behind, at the level of the knee-cap form a triangular process which in the horse receives the name of the _stifle fold_, from the name veterinarians give to the region of the articulation of the knee. This fold of skin, which commences on the antero-internal surface of this region, is directed upwards, and then forwards, to end by gradually disappearing over the corresponding part of the abdomen. [Illustration: FIG. 71.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: PANNICULUS MUSCLE OF THE TRUNK.] In the same animal the muscular fibres of the panniculus of the trunk arise along a line which connects the stifle-joint to the withers, a line which is, consequently, oblique upwards and forwards. Now, as the fleshy layer is thicker than the aponeurosis, the result is that the mode of constitution of this muscle can be recognised under the skin. Indeed, we can see in some animals, occasionally very distinctly, a slight elevation starting from the region of the abdomen in the neighbourhood of the knee, and thence directed obliquely upwards and forwards. This elevation is produced by the fleshy portion of the panniculus. In the carnivora, the panniculus of the trunk is not attached to the supraspinous ligament; it is blended with the same muscle of the opposite side, passing over the spinous region of the vertebral column. From this arrangement results a great mobility of the skin which covers the back. Further, it explains why it is possible to lift up this skin along with the panniculus which it covers, and to which it adheres, throughout the whole extent of the dorso-lumbar column. As we pointed out above, there is also a panniculus muscle of the shoulder and one of the neck. We will deal with them when treating of the regions to which those muscles belong. The Coccygeal Region As a sequel to the study of the muscles of the region of the trunk very naturally comes the description of those which, belonging to the region of the coccyx, are destined for the movements of the caudal appendix, of which this latter constitutes the skeleton. The muscles may not seem to be of much importance with regard to external form, but, as they form part of the superficial muscular layer, and as the mass of each is seen in the form of the tail in some animals (the lion, for example), they merit our attention for a moment. A few lines will suffice to give an idea of them. They are: the _ischio-coccygeal_, _superior sacro-coccygeal_, _lateral sacro-coccygeal_, and _inferior sacro-coccygeal_. =The Ischio-coccygeal= (Fig. 18, 38; Fig. 69, 33; Fig. 70, 42).--This muscle, triangular in shape, better developed in the carnivora than in the horse, arises from the spine of the ischium, or from the supracotyloid crest, which replaces this latter in the solipeds and the ruminants. Thence its fleshy mass is directed upwards, expanding as it proceeds to be inserted into the transverse processes of the first two coccygeal vertebrÃ¦ after insinuating itself between two of the following muscles, the lateral and inferior sacro-coccygeal. In the dog and cat, the muscle is in great part covered by the great gluteal. In the ox, by a peculiar arrangement of the corresponding region of the muscles of the thigh--an arrangement which we will examine in connection with the study of the latter--it is more exposed than in the horse, and gives origin to an outline which corresponds to its general form in the region situated immediately below the root of the tail. It is a depressor of the whole caudal appendix. =The Superior Sacro-coccygeal= (Fig. 68, 39; Fig. 69, 34; Fig. 70, 43).--The fasciculi which form this muscle arise from the crest of the sacrum, and proceed thence to end successively on the coccygeal vertebrÃ¦. It is in contact in the middle line with the corresponding muscle of the opposite side. It raises the tail and inclines it laterally; if the muscle of one side contracts at the same time as that of the other the tail is elevated directly. =The Lateral Sacro-coccygeal= (Fig. 68, 40; Fig. 69, 35; Fig. 70, 44).--Situated on the lateral part of the caudal region, this muscle arises, in the dog, from the internal border of the iliac bone and the external border of the sacrum; in the horse, it arises from the crest of the sacrum. It is inserted into the coccygeal vertebrÃ¦. It produces lateral movement of the tail. =The Inferior Sacro-coccygeal= (Fig. 68, 41; Fig. 69, 36; Fig. 70, 43).--This muscle, which is fairly thick, arises from the inferior surface of the sacrum and the corresponding surface of the sacro-sciatic ligament; it is inserted into the coccygeal vertebrÃ¦. It depresses the caudal appendix. Muscles of the Neck =Mastoido-humeralis= (Fig. 66, 3; Fig. 68, 9, 9, 10; Fig. 69, 12; Fig. 70, 15).--One of the most important muscles of the region of the neck in man is the sterno-cleido mastoid. We recollect that, in its inferior part, it is divided into two bundles, one of which arises from the manubrium of the sternum, and the other from the inner third of the clavicle, whence the denominations of the _sternal_ portion and _clavicular_ portion. The muscle formed by the union of these two portions is then directed obliquely outwards, backwards, and upwards, to be inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the two external thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Now, the animals which we are here considering have but a rudimentary clavicle or are entirely without it. From the absence of this item of the skeleton there necessarily result modifications in the arrangement of the muscles of this region, which we must at the very outset explain, before undertaking the special study of the muscle which is the subject of the present paragraph. Let us suppose, for the more definite arrangement of our ideas, that the clavicle is altogether absent, although we do find it in a rudimentary state in some animals and completely developed in others (marmot, bat), and we will proceed to indicate what this absence determines. The great pectoral muscle in man arises in part from the clavicle; this origin not being possible in animals which have no clavicle, its attachments, as we have already seen, are concentrated on the sternum. The trapezius in man similarly arises in part from the clavicle; for the reasons above indicated its clavicular fasciculi cannot exist in distinct form in the animals which have no clavicle. The sterno-cleido mastoid, whose inferior attachments we mentioned above, cannot have a clavicular portion. It is the same in the case of the deltoid, which, we know, arises in part from the anterior bone of the shoulder. Of the four muscles which have partial clavicular origins in man, two are known to us in connection with animals--the great pectoral and the trapezius. What has become of the other two, the sterno-cleido mastoid and the deltoid? It is this which we now proceed to investigate. After a fashion simple enough, but which it is necessary to describe, the clavicular fasciculi of the trapezius and the corresponding fasciculi of the sterno-cleido mastoid are united the one to the other; the portion of the deltoid which in man arises from the clavicle, by reason of the absence of this latter, is also combined with the fleshy mass formed by the preceding muscles. From this fusion results the muscle known as the mastoido-humeral. This muscle, which consists of a long fleshy band situated on the lateral aspect of the neck, takes its origin, as a general rule, from the posterior surface of the skull and the upper part of the neck, from which it passes obliquely downwards and backwards, covering the scapulo-humeral angle--that is, the region known as the point of the shoulder or arm--and is inserted into the anterior border of the humerus, the border which, limiting anteriorly the musculo-spiral groove, forms a continuation of the deltoid impression. On account of the regions with which it is related, Bourgelat named this muscle _the muscle common to the head, neck, and arm_. It is at the level of the scapulo-humeral angle that the vestiges of the clavicle are found. This bone is represented in some animals--the pig, ox, and horse--by a single tendinous intersection, more or less apparent, which extends transversely from the scapula to the anterior extremity of the sternum. In the dog and the cat, we find, besides, on the deep surface of the muscle and at the level of this tendinous intersection, the rudiment of the clavicle of which we made mention in the section on Osteology (see p. 25). It is beneath the intersection, the existence of which we have just pointed out, that is found that portion of the mastoido-humeral muscle which corresponds to the clavicular fasciculi of the deltoid; that portion which is situated above the intersection corresponds to the clavicular fibres of the sterno-cleido-mastoid and of the trapezius. The mastoido-humeral presents certain varieties in different animals. In the dog and the cat, this muscle, which is blended above with the sterno-mastoid (see p. 153), to be inserted with it into the mastoid process and the mastoid crest, covers the neck for a considerable extent from the superior curved line of the occipital bone to which it is attached, to the trapezius with which it unites posteriorly, but from which it separates below. Between these two extreme points of its superior portion it is attached to the cervical ligament. In the pig and in ruminants, in which the trapezius approaches more closely to the head, the mastoido-humeral occupies, in consequence, a less extent of the cervical region. In the horse, the mastoido-humeral neither covers the neck nor joins the trapezius; indeed, we have already shown that it is separated by a considerable distance from the head. In the limited interval between these two muscles a part of the rhomboid and parts of other muscles are seen with which we shall soon be occupied. This muscle, as regards the horse, is described by some anatomists as consisting of two parts: one anterior, or superficial; the other posterior, or deep. In reality, the first only corresponds to the mastoido-humeral, which we are considering; the posterior may be more exactly regarded as representing a special muscle of quadrupeds, but which is here a little deformed, the _omo-trachelian_ (see p. 155). When the mastoido-humeral contracts, taking its fixed point above, it acts as an extensor of the humerus, and carries the entire fore-limb forwards. If it takes its fixed point below--that is to say, at the humerus--it inclines the head and neck to its own side. If it contracts at the same time as the mastoido-humeral of the opposite side, then the head and the neck are carried into the position of extension. =The Sterno-mastoid= (Fig. 66, 5; Fig. 68, 11; Fig. 69, 15; Fig. 70, 17).--Having described the clavicular portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoid in connection with the mastoido-humeral, because it forms a part of the latter, we have, in order to complete the homologies of this muscle, to study now that which corresponds to its sternal portion. This is the _sterno-mastoid_ muscle. In all the quadrupeds with which we are here concerned this muscle arises from the anterior extremity of the sternum; narrow and elongated in form, it passes towards the head in a direction parallel to the anterior border of the mastoido-humeral, from which it is separated by an interspace which, along its whole length, lodges superficially the jugular vein; hence the name of _jugular groove_, which is given to this part of the neck (Fig. 10, 18). It is inserted, in the case of the dog and cat, into the mastoid process, where it is united with the mastoido-humeral; in the ox it is divided into two portions--one which goes to the base of the occipital bone, the other passing in front of the masseter is by the medium of the aponeurosis of this latter attached to the zygomatic crest. This latter part is considered by some writers as forming a portion of the panniculus muscle of the neck. In the horse it is attached to the angle of the lower jaw by a tendon, which an aponeurosis that passes under the parotid gland binds to the mastoido-humeral muscle and the mastoid process. By reason of this insertion into the jaw, in the case of the solipeds, this muscle is further named the _sterno-maxillary_. When it contracts, it flexes the head, and inclines it laterally. This movement is changed to direct flexion when the two sterno-mastoid muscles contract simultaneously. In man, the sterno-cleido-mastoid and the trapezius leave a triangular space between them, which, being limited inferiorly by the middle third of the clavicle, is known as the supraclavicular region; this region, being depressed, especially in its inferior part, has also been given the name of supraclavicular fossa--popularly called the '_salt-cellar_.' The muscles which form the floor of this region, passing from above downwards, are: a very small portion of the complexus, splenius, levator anguli scapulÃ¦, posterior scalenus, and anterior scalenus; then, crossing these latter, and most superficial, is the omo-hyoid muscle. An analogous region, but of only slight depth, exists in quadrupeds; its borders are formed by the mastoido-humeral and trapezius muscles. It is not limited below by the clavicle--we know, indeed, that this, or the intersection which represents it, belongs to the mastoido-humeral muscle--but by the inferior portion of the spine of the scapula. It is of greater or less extent according to the species considered. In the dog, cat, pig, and ox, it is narrow, for the muscles which bound it approach one another pretty closely. It has, as in man, the form of a triangle, with the apex above. In the horse it is much broader, and, contrary to the arrangement which it presents in the human species, the widest part is directed upwards. The muscles which we find there are, consequently, more or less numerous. In the dog and cat they are: a portion of a muscle which we do not normally meet with in man--the _omo-trachelian_--then in a decreasing extent: supraspinatus, levator anguli scapulÃ¦ and splenius. In the pig: the omo-trachelian, supraspinatus, and the terminal portion of the sterno-prescapular--the anterior part of the lesser or deep pectoral muscle. In the ox: the omo-trachelian only. But in the horse we find the omo-trachelian, the supraspinatus, and the terminal extremity of the sterno-prescapular; then in a larger extent of area the levator anguli scapulÃ¦ and the splenius; and, finally, the anterior portion of the rhomboid. Among the muscles which we have just enumerated are some that we have already studied; these are the sterno-prescapular and the rhomboid. We will examine the supraspinatus muscle in connection with the region of the shoulder. As to the scaleni muscles and the complexus, they are deeply situated, whereas the omo-hyoid is visible in the anterior region of the neck only. There remain for us, accordingly, to examine, at the present juncture, but the omo-trachelian, levator anguli scapulÃ¦, and splenius muscles. =The Omo-trachelian Muscle= (Fig. 68, 13; Fig. 69, 17; Fig. 70, 20).--Also called the _acromio-trachelian_, _levator ventri scapulÃ¦_,[21] the _angulo-ventral muscle_, and the _transverso-scapular_,[22] etc., this muscle is described by some hippotomists as belonging to the mastoido-humeral, of which it then forms its posterior or deep portion (see p. 153). [21] Ventri, because inserted into the inferior part of the spine of the scapula, towards the acromion--that is, on the ventral side--by contrast with the trapezius, which is attached higher up (dorsal side) on the same process. [22] Among the many names given to this muscle, Arloing and Lesbre recommend the adoption of the name 'transverse scapular' given by Straus-Durckheim, or 'transverse of the shoulder' (Arloing and Lesbre, 'Suggestions for the Reform of Veterinarian Muscular Nomenclature,' Lyons, 1898). The omo-trachelian muscle is found in all mammalia, man alone excepted. It is, however, sometimes found in the human being; but it then constitutes an anomaly. In the dog, pig, and ox, it arises from the inferior part of the spine of the scapula, in the region of the acromion, and terminates on the lateral portion of the atlas. In the cat it is attached besides to the base of the occipital bone. It is visible in the space limited by the trapezius and the mastoido-humeral, the direction of which it crosses obliquely. In the horse it appears to be blended in clearly defined fashion with the mastoido-humeral. Attached below, like this latter, to the anterior border of the humerus, it covers the scapulo-humeral angle; and is attached by its upper portion to the transverse processes of the first four cervical vertebrÃ¦. We remember that the transverse processes are often, from their relation with the trachea, known as the tracheal processes. Hence the word 'trachelian,' which forms part of the name of the muscle with which we are now dealing. By its contraction it helps to draw the anterior limb forwards. When this muscle, as an abnormality, exists in man, it arises from the clavicle or the acromion process, traverses the supraclavicular fossa, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the atlas or axis, or of both these vertebrÃ¦, or of the cervical vertebrÃ¦ below these latter. It is then known by the names of the _elevator of the clavicle_ or _elevator of the scapula_, and, finally, as the _cleido-omo-transversalis_ (Testut).[23] [23] L. Testut, 'Les anomalies musculaires chez l'homme expliquÃ©es par l'anatomie comparÃ©e,' Paris, 1884, p. 97. A. F. Le Double, 'TraitÃ© des variations du systÃ¨me musculaire de l'homme et de leur signification au point de vue de l'anthropologie zoologique,' Paris, 1897, t. i., p. 235. =The Levator Anguli ScapulÃ¦= (Fig. 68, 15; Fig. 70, 23).--As we have pointed out (p. 136), the levator anguli scapulÃ¦, because of its connections with the great serratus, is sometimes described with it. But inasmuch as in human anatomy these two muscles are considered separately, and that, in the superficial layer of muscles, they are seen in different regions--the great serratus in the thoracic, and the levator anguli scapulÃ¦ in the cervical--we prefer to study them separately. We remember that in man this muscle arises from the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrÃ¦ and is inserted into the superior portion of the spinal border of the scapula, into the portion of this border which is situated above the spine; it also contributes to the formation of the floor of the supraclavicular region. When it contracts, it draws the superior portion of the scapula forwards and upwards, and causes a see-saw movement, for at the same time the inferior angle of the scapula is directed backwards. Taking its fixed point at the shoulder, it directly extends the neck if the muscle of one side acts at the same time as that of the opposite; but if only one muscle contracts it inclines the neck to the corresponding side. It is to be noticed that during movements a little more active than the ordinary the levator anguli scapulÃ¦, as moreover the other muscles of the neck do, becomes very distinct. We have, indeed, often remarked that, apart from these movements, each time the support of one of the fore-limbs is brought into requisition a brusque contraction of the muscles of this region accompanies it. This contraction gives the impression that, as on the one hand, each support determines a momentary arrest of progression, a jolt, and on the other hand, the head continues to be projected in the forward direction, the latter should be retained. But it cannot be so except by an effort in the opposite direction--that is to say, by the brusque contraction which we have just pointed out. Analogous contractions also take place in a man while running at the beginning of each contact of the lower limbs with the ground. We may add, apropos of this latter, that displacements of the head, sometimes in very pronounced fashion, take place during simple walking, and that every time one of the lower limbs is carried forwards the head is projected in the same direction. These displacements, which we also find take place in the horse in pacing, especially in the region of the neck and head, seem then to have the effect of aiding the progression of the body forwards. They occur especially in animals when drawing a heavy load, and in individuals whose walking movements are executed with difficulty. It is necessary to repeat that, in these cases, the individual appears to assist the movement of his body by the impetus which the projection of his head forward determines, in order to add--and it is for this that we have referred to the subject--that during the intervals between each projection the head is carried backwards by a muscular contraction similar to that above discussed. =The Splenius= (Fig. 68, 14; Fig. 70, 22).--In man, this muscle is attached in the median line to the inferior half or two-thirds of the posterior cervical ligament, to the spinous processes of the seventh cervical, and four or five upper dorsal vertebrÃ¦; it passes obliquely upwards and outwards, becomes visible in the supraclavicular region, passes under the sterno-cleido-mastoid, and proceeds to duplicate the cranial insertions of this latter; and, further, the most external fasciculi of this muscle are inserted into the transverse processes of the atlas and the axis. These separate superior attachments, and the division of the muscle which results, have caused the splenius to be regarded as formed of two portions: splenius of the head, and splenius of the neck. In the horse, this muscle, which is of voluminous dimensions, arises from the superior cervical ligament, and the spinous processes of the first four or five dorsal vertebrÃ¦; thence it proceeds to be inserted into the mastoid crest, and the transverse processes of the atlas and three or four vertebrÃ¦ following. The region occupied superficially by the splenius is remarkable for the prominence which this muscle, with the deeply-seated complexus, which is equally bulky, determines at this level; it is situated above that region of the neck, in which are seen in part the fasciculi of the levator anguli scapulÃ¦. It terminates above and in front in the ridge, which is sometimes very pronounced, which the transverse processes of the atlas make on each side of this part of the neck. In the dog and the cat, the superior and anterior region of the neck is thick and of rounded form, on account of the development which the splenius presents in those animals; but it is covered by the mastoido-humeral. This latter relation is also found in the ox, but the splenius in this case is but slightly developed. When the splenius contracts it extends the head and neck, while inclining them to its own side. If the splenius of one side contracts at the same time as that of the opposite, the extension takes place in a direct manner--that is to say, without any modifying lateral movement. Infrahyoid Muscles Having studied the lateral surfaces of the neck, we must now examine the anterior part of this region. Here, between the two sterno-mastoid muscles, we find a space broader above than below, in which are situated the larynx and the trachea, to the general arrangement of which is due the cylindrical form which this region presents. This space corresponds to that which in the neck of man is limited laterally by the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles, below by the fourchette of the sternum, and above by the hyoid bone. In animals, as in man, it is called the infrahyoid region. The hyoid bone in quadrupeds is situated between the two rami or branches of the lower jaw. Owing to this disposition, the region above this bone, instead of having its surface projecting a little beyond the inferior border of the maxillary bone, is depressed. This is especially so in the horse. It is there that we find in this animal the region known as the _trough_ (_auge_); the larynx corresponds to that part known as the _gullet_. The muscles which occupy the infrahyoid region are: the sterno-thyroid, the sterno-hyoid, and the omo-hyoid. There is also a thyro-hyoid, but because of its deep situation and its slight importance it offers no interest from our point of view. =Sterno-thyroid and the Sterno-hyoid Muscles.=--These two muscles, long, narrow, and flat, arise from the anterior extremity of the sternum; then, covering the anterior surface of the trachea, they proceed to terminate, the one on the thyroid cartilage, and the other on the hyoid bone. The sterno-hyoid is superficial; it covers the sterno-thyroid, which, however, projects a little on its outer side. =Omo-hyoid.=--This muscle does not exist in the dog or cat. It arises, in the horse, from the cervical border of the scapula, where it blends with the aponeurosis that envelops the subscapularis muscle, but in the pig and the ox it arises from the deep surface of the mastoido-humeral muscle. It is directed obliquely upwards and inwards, becoming superficial at the internal border of the sterno-mastoid, and is inserted into the hyoid bone. The region in which are united the portion of the neck which we have just studied and the neighbouring part of the thorax--that is, the breast--has certainly, in our opinion, a form less expressive than the corresponding region in man. In the latter, indeed, the fourchette of the sternum, with the hollow which it determines, the heads of the clavicles, and the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles, by the elevations which they produce, and the trachea, by the situation which it occupies in the inferior part, constitute a whole in which are admirably indicated, not only the forms of the organs which constitute this region, but also the relations which these organs have one with another; and, to a certain extent, their respective functions. In making an exception in the case of the ox, in which a fold of skin, the _dewlap_, which passes from the neck to the breast, constitutes an element of form which possesses some expressive value; in the horse and in the dog, which possess no sternal fourchette and no heads of clavicles, the bones and the muscles are found nearly on the same plane. This produces a uniformity which is evidently inferior, from an Ã¦sthetic point of view, to the modelling of the corresponding region of the human body. Such, at least, is our impression. Suprahyoid Muscles As their name indicates, these muscles are found above the hyoid bone; amongst those which should arrest our attention for a moment are the mylo-hyoid and the digastric. =Mylo-hyoid.=--This muscle, forming a sort of fleshy sling which contributes in great measure to form the floor of the mouth, is situated between the lateral halves of the inferior maxillary bone. Arising on each side from the internal oblique line of the mandible, its fibres are directed towards the median line, to be inserted posteriorly into the hyoid bone, and, between this bone and the anterior part of the mandible, into a median raphe which unites these latter. =Digastric.=--This muscle arises from the styloid process of the occipital bone and from the jugular process; it thence passes downwards and forwards, and terminates variously, in different species. In the ox and the horse it terminates in its anterior portion on the internal surface of the inferior maxillary bone, close to the chin. But in the horse a bundle of fibres is detached from the upper portion of the muscle, to be inserted into the recurved portion of the jaw. It is to this fasciculus that Bourgelat has given the name of '_stylo-maxillary muscle_.' In the pig, dog, and cat, the digastric differs more from the corresponding muscle in man; it is not, as in the latter, formed of two parts. The anterior portion only exists. This consists of a thick muscular mass, which is inserted into the middle of the internal surface of the lower jaw. In the dog and cat it is clearly recognisable in the superficial layer of muscles by the long and thick prominence which it produces below the masseter, against the inferior border of the mandible (see pp. 235 and 237, the two figures showing the myology of the head of the dog). By its contraction, it draws the lower jaw downwards and backwards. =Panniculus of the Neck.=--This very thin muscle, which cannot be recognised on the exterior, calls for little notice. We shall merely point out that it duplicates the skin of the cervical region; but as the latter is only slightly adherent to it, the panniculus of this region seems rather destined to maintain in position the muscles which it covers than to displace the cutaneous covering. We recall the fact that in man, on the contrary, the muscle is very evident at the instant of its contraction, and, for this reason, it presents a very great interest with regard to external modelling, and it plays an important part in the expression of the physiognomy. MUSCLES OF THE ANTERIOR LIMBS Muscles of the Shoulder =Deltoid= (Fig. 68, 16, 17; Fig. 69, 18; Fig. 70, 24).--This is the first muscle we study in connection with the shoulder in human anatomy. Indeed, its wholly superficial position, and especially the manner in which it is separated from the surrounding muscles, its volume, and its characteristic modelling, give it such an importance that, from the didactic point of view, there is every indication for commencing with this muscle in studying the region to which it belongs. If, in regard to quadrupeds, we also commence with it, it is merely in deference to the spirit of method, and for the sake of symmetry; for it is far from presenting, in the latter, characters so distinctive and so clearly defined. It is necessary to remark, at the outset, that in quadrupeds, on account of the absence or slight development of the clavicle, the clavicular portion of this muscle is, as we have shown, united to bundles of the same kind belonging to the sterno-cleido-mastoid and trapezius to form the mastoido-humeral (see p. 151). There exists, therefore, in an independent form, the scapular portion only. It is this latter which, by itself alone, forms the deltoid of quadrupeds, a muscle known, in veterinary anatomy, as _the long abductor of the arm_. In the dog and the cat it consists of two parts, one of which arises from the spine of the scapula; the other from the acromion process. Thence it passes to the crest of the humerus, which limits the musculo-spiral groove anteriorly, to be attached at a point which is found, as in other quadrupeds, to be the homologue of the human deltoid impression, or deltoid [V], of the human humerus. In the ox, in which the acromion process, which is very rudimentary, does not attain the level of the glenoid cavity, the acromion portion is but slightly marked off from that which takes its origin from the spine of the scapula. Still, in the horse, which is completely deprived of an acromion process, the deltoid muscle is correspondingly divided into two parts, separated from one another by superficial interstices, but of which the arrangement differs from that of the portions above indicated; one part, the posterior, arises above from the superior part of the posterior border, and the postero-superior angle of the scapula (exactly as if, in man, certain fasciculi of the deltoid took their origin from the axillary border and inferior angle of the scapula); the other, anterior, arises from the tuberosity of the spine of the same bone. The two parts, united inferiorly, proceed to be inserted into the deltoid impression or infratrochiterian crest of the humerus. It is necessary to add that the deltoid is inserted into the humerus, above the insertion of the mastoido-humeral. This muscle flexes and abducts the humerus, and also rotates it outwards. With regard to the other muscles of the human shoulder, subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and teres major, they are also present in quadrupeds, but in a form more elongated, as the scapula has its dimensions more extended from below upwards--that is, from the glenoid cavity towards the superior or spinal border. =Subscapularis.=--This muscle occupies the subscapular fossa, from which it takes its origin, leaving free the superior part where the surface is found, to which are attached the serratus magnus and the levator anguli scapulÃ¦. It passes towards the arm, to be inserted into the small tuberosity of the humerus. It is an adductor of the arm. The subscapularis does not offer any interest from the point of view of external form, for it is completely covered by the scapula. We speak of it, however, because we mention it in human anatomy, and that it affords us here a new opportunity of bringing into prominence the differences which exist in connection with the mobility of the shoulder. We remember that in man, when the arm is abducted, and then raised a little above the horizontal, the scapula see-saws, is separated, to a certain extent, from the thoracic cage inferiorly and externally, and that, on the superficial layer of muscles, we are then able to see in the bottom of the armpit, at the level of the deep portion of the posterior wall of the latter, a small part of the subscapularis muscle. In the animals with which we are here occupied it is not the same; for they are incapable of performing with their fore-limbs a movement analogous to that to which we have just referred, the humerus in their case being retained in contact with the trunk by the muscular masses which surround it. =Supraspinatus= (Fig. 68, 19; Fig. 70, 25; Fig. 72, 7).--This muscle, as its name indicates, occupies the supraspinous fossa--that is to say, that which, by reason of the direction of the scapula in quadrupeds, is situated in front of rather than above the spine. It arises from this fossa; and, further, from the external surface of the cartilage which prolongs the scapula upwards in solipeds and ruminants. It projects more or less beyond the supraspinous fossa in front. After passing downwards towards the humerus, it is inserted into the summit of the great tuberosity or trochiter--that is to say, to a part of this osseous prominence which represents the anterior facet of the great tuberosity of the human humerus, into which, as we know, the corresponding muscle is inserted. In solipeds and ruminants it is inserted, by a second fasciculus, into the small tuberosity. In the pig and the horse its anterior border is in relation with the terminal portion of the sterno-prescapular anterior portion of the small or deep pectoral. The supraspinatus, which in man is completely covered by the trapezius, is partly visible in the superficial layer of the cat, dog, pig, and horse, in the lower part of the space limited by the mastoido-humeral and the trapezius. It is crossed by the scapulo-trachelian. It is, in the ox, completely covered by these muscles, but its form, notwithstanding this, is easily discerned by the prominence which it produces. When it contracts, the supraspinatus muscle carries the humerus into the position of extension. =Infraspinatus= (Fig. 68, 20; Fig. 72, 8).--This muscle, which occupies the infraspinous fossa, which, in quadrupeds, is situated behind the spine of the scapula, arises from the whole extent of this fossa, and in solipeds and ruminants encroaches on the cartilage of prolongation. Its fibres are directed downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the great tuberosity of the humerus--the trochiter--below the insertion of the supraspinatus. It is completely covered (ox and horse), or in part only (cat and dog), by the portion of the deltoid which arises from the spine of the scapula; nevertheless, its presence is revealed by the prominence which it produces. It is an abductor and external rotator of the humerus. In connection with this muscle, which, as we have just pointed out, is less seen in the superficial muscular layer than the supraspinatus, we will draw attention to the fact that this arrangement is exactly the reverse of that which is found in the human shoulder. In this latter it is the supraspinatus which is not visible; while, on the contrary, the infraspinatus is uncovered in a considerable part of its extent. We further notice that it is accompanied by the teres minor, and that the teres major, situated inferiorly, forms with these two muscles a fleshy mass which, below, ends on the superior border of the great dorsal muscle. In quadrupeds, in which the infraspinatus is so slightly visible, the teres major and minor are not found at all in the superficial muscular layer. Accordingly, we will say but few words about them. [Illustration: FIG. 72.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE--SHOULDER AND ARM: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Cartilage of prolongation of the scapula; 2, tuberosity of the spine of the scapula; 3, superior extremity of the humerus; 4, inferior extremity of the humerus; 5, radius; 6, ulna; 7, supraspinatus muscle; 8, infraspinatus; 9, teres minor; 10, biceps; 11, tendon of the biceps passing over the anterior surface of the superior extremity of the humerus; 12, brachialis anticus; 13, triceps, long head; 14, external head of the triceps divided; 15, external head of the triceps reflected, in order to expose the anconeus; 16, region normally occupied by the external head of the triceps; 17, anconeus.] =Teres Minor= (Fig. 72, 9).--This muscle, also called in veterinary anatomy _the short abductor of the arm_, arises from the posterior border of the scapula (the external border in man), and is inserted below the great tuberosity of the humerus, between the attachments of the infraspinatus and deltoid. It is covered by the deltoid and the infraspinatus. =Teres Major.=--This muscle is known to veterinarians as _the abductor of the arm_; it arises from the postero-superior angle of the scapula (the inferior angle of the human scapula), from which it passes to be inserted into the internal surface of the humerus. It is covered by the latissimus dorsi and the posterior muscular mass of the arm. In brief, for the better understanding of the relations of the teres major and minor muscles in quadrupeds, we may fancy the corresponding muscles in man modified in the following manner: The infraspinatus, thicker, covering the teres minor; latissimus dorsi, more extended in its superior part, covering a large proportion of the teres major. As to the relations of the teres minor with the deltoid, they exist in man, seeing, in this case, the same muscle is, in its external portion, covered by this latter. With regard to the relations of the teres major with the posterior muscular mass of the arm, they also exist in man, since the external surface of this muscle is covered by the triceps. These modifications are sufficient to render the small and large teres muscles completely invisible in the superficial layer. The muscles of the shoulder which we have just been studying fulfil, with regard to the articulation which they surround, the function of active ligaments. This rÃ´le is made necessary by the laxity of the scapulo-humeral capsule--a laxity which renders it incapable by itself of maintaining the bones in contact at this joint. The same condition exists in man. =Panniculus Muscle of the Shoulder.=--This thin muscle covers, as its name implies, the region of the shoulder, and is the continuation forward of the panniculus muscle of the trunk. It arises, by its superior part, from the region of the withers and from the superior cervical ligament; thence its fibres descend directly towards the elbow, to terminate at the level of the region of the forearm. The muscle is not found in the pig or in the carnivora. Muscles of the Arm We should remember, at the outset, that in man the muscles of the arm are divided into two groups: one anterior, which contains the biceps, brachialis anticus, and the coraco-brachialis; the other, posterior, which is constituted by a single muscle, the triceps. In animals, we find them in the same number and arranged in analogous fashion--that is to say, in two groups--with respect to the bone of the arm. But then we find that they have undergone a transformation with regard to their length, and it is the change of general aspect which results from this modification that we proceed to examine. We know that in quadrupeds, and especially in the domestic animals, the humerus is relatively short in proportion to the forearm. We have already seen, in dealing with the bones, that whilst in the human species the humerus is longer than the forearm, in the dog and cat these two segments of the fore-limb are of equal length, and that the humerus of the horse is, on the contrary, much shorter. Now, let us suppose the human humerus to be shorter than it is in reality; the anterior muscles undergoing, very naturally, the same reduction, will be uncovered only slightly by those above--the deltoid and the great pectoral--or will remain completely hidden by them. Thus would be found realized the disposition which we meet with in quadrupeds of the muscles of this region. With regard to the posterior muscular mass of the arm, it does not undergo the same change. The muscle which constitutes it--the triceps cubiti--occupies, on the contrary, a greater area. Let us suppose, further--for it is the best method of comprehending the homologies which now occupy our attention--the humerus of man to be shortened as before, and directed downwards and backwards (as in quadrupeds), this bone would form an acute angle with the axillary border of the scapula. Let us suppose also that the long portion of the triceps, instead of arising solely from the superior part of this axillary border, is attached to the whole length of the latter, and that the triceps fills the whole interior of the angle formed by the arm and the shoulder. We then shall have an idea of what the triceps is in quadrupeds. It is necessary to add that the general resemblance would be still more complete if the arm were firmly supported by the side of the thorax, because in quadrupeds it occupies an analogous position, determined by the arrangement of the muscles which, proceeding from the trunk and neck, are attached to it. Anterior Region =Biceps Cubiti= (Fig. 68, 21; Fig. 72, 10, 11).--This muscle, also called _the long flexor of the forearm_, does not merit the name except by its analogy with the corresponding muscle in man. Indeed, in the domestic animals it is not divided into two parts; it is represented by a single fasciculus, long and fusiform, situated on the front of the humerus, and directed obliquely downwards and backwards, as the latter, on its part, is also inclined. It arises above from a tubercle at the base of the coracoid process, which surmounts the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Its tendon, which is highly developed in the solipeds, occupies the bicipital groove. We remember that in these latter the groove in question is divided into two channels by a median prominence. The tendon in which the muscle ends is inserted into a tuberosity, situated on the internal surface of the superior extremity of the radius--the bicipital tuberosity. In the pig, the cat, and the dog, there is detached from the tendon to which we have just referred a fasciculus of the same nature, which, after having wound round the radius, is inserted into the internal surface of the ulna, towards the base of the olecranon process. From the inferior part of the muscle arises a fibrous band, comparable to the aponeurotic expansion of the human biceps; but, instead of passing downwards and inwards, as does the latter, it terminates on the muscular mass which constitutes the antero-external part of the forearm. The biceps is not seen in the superficial layer, except in the dog and cat (in which the humerus is, in fact, proportionately long); and even in them only to the slightest extent. It is covered partly in these latter, and completely in other animals, by the great pectoral and the inferior portion of the mastoido-humeral--that is to say, that part of the latter which represents the whole of the clavicular fibres of the human deltoid. The biceps is a flexor of the forearm on the arm. It also contributes to the movement of extension of the humerus. =Brachialis Anticus= (Fig. 68, 22; Fig. 69, 19; Fig. 70, 27; Fig. 72, 12).--In veterinary anatomy further designated as _the short flexor of the forearm_, this muscle, which is thick, occupies the musculo-spiral groove, and arises from it, reaching upwards to just below the head of the humerus. But it does not, as in man, extend to the internal surface of the bone. Situated on the outside of the biceps, it is directed towards the forearm, and terminates by a flattened tendon, which, dividing into two slips, passes below the bicipital tuberosity, on the internal surface of the radius, into which one of these slips is inserted, while the other proceeds to terminate on the ulna. The inferior half of this muscle is visible on the superficial layer, in the space limited posteriorly by the triceps brachialis, and below by the muscles of the forearm, which correspond to the external muscles of the human forearm, and in front by the great pectoral and the mastoido-humeral. It is in the upper part of the interspace which separates these latter from the brachialis anticus that the deltoid insinuates itself to proceed to its insertion into the humerus. These relations precisely recall those which we meet with when we examine the external surface of the human arm, with this difference, however--that in the latter the anterior brachialis anticus is extensively related, in front, to the biceps. However, in animals it is not absolutely the same, since, as we have shown above, the biceps is covered, more or less completely, by the mastoido-humeral and the great pectoral. The brachialis anticus flexes the forearm on the arm. =Coraco-brachialis.=--In man this muscle, which occupies the superior half, or third, of the internal surface of the humerus, is visible only when the arm is abducted, and then especially when it approaches the vertical position; indeed, it is only in this attitude that the region which it occupies is accessible to view. But an analogous attitude not being possible in domestic animals, in which the arm is fixed along the corresponding parts of the trunk, the result is that the coraco-brachialis is always covered, and that, consequently, it presents nothing of interest from our point of view. We speak of it, then, merely in order to complete the series of the muscles of the anterior surface of the arm, among which we rank it, in spite of the fact that in veterinary anatomy it is described as a muscle of the shoulder. It arises above from the coracoid process, and thence passes downwards towards the internal surface of the humerus into which it is inserted, more or less high up, according to the species. The coraco-brachialis is an adductor of the arm. Posterior Region =Triceps Cubiti= (Fig. 68, 23, 24; Fig. 69, 20, 21; Fig. 70, 28, 29; Fig. 72, 13, 14, 15, 16).--This muscle, which is voluminous in the quadrupeds with which we are here concerned, fits more or less completely the angular space between the scapula and the humerus. Its bulk forms a thick prominence, which surmounts the elbow and the forearm. We should say, with regard to this mass, that if the deltoid does not constitute in quadrupeds a prominence sufficient to remind one of that which this muscle produces in man, the triceps, in producing an analogous elevation, seems to replace in the general form of the body the relief which the deltoid is incapable of producing. The triceps is divided into three portions, which, as in man, have the names middle, or long head; external and internal heads. But that which renders the nomenclature a little complicated is that veterinary anatomists have given other names to these three parts: that of _great extensor of the forearm_ (caput magnum) to the long head; _the short extensor of the forearm_ (caput parvum) to the external head; and of _medium extensor of the forearm_ (caput medium) to the internal.[24] [24] Other names given by certain authors to the parts of this muscle which we have just enumerated still further complicate this nomenclature. The long head is further designated by them under the names of the _long_ or _great anconeus_; the _external head_ under those of _external anconeus_, or _lateral_ or _short anconeus_; whilst the internal head becomes the _internal anconeus_, or _median_. It is more especially the long portion and the external head which, being visible on the external surface of the arm, contribute to the external form. The long portion, which is triangular in shape and of considerable development, arises in the cat and the dog from the inferior half or two-thirds of the posterior border of the scapula (axillary border); from the whole extent of that border as far as the superior posterior angle in the pig, the ox, and the horse; it then passes downwards towards the articulation of the elbow, to terminate in a tendon which is inserted into the olecranon process. The portion of this muscle which is next the scapula is covered by the deltoid. The external head, situated below the long portion, is directed obliquely downwards and backwards. It arises from the curved crest which, from the deltoid impression of the humerus, is directed upward to meet the articular head of the same bone. This crest limiting the musculo-spiral groove superiorly, and the brachialis anticus arising from the whole extent of this groove, the result is that at this level the external head is in relation with the brachialis anticus. From this origin it is directed towards the elbow, to be inserted into the olecranon, either directly or by the medium of the tendon of the long portion. The part of this muscle which arises from the humerus is covered by the deltoid. As for the internal head (Fig. 76, 4), which, in the superficial layer, is only visible in its inferior part, on the internal aspect of the arm in those animals in which the elbow is free of the lateral wall of the thorax (the dog and the cat, for example), it arises from the internal surface of the humerus, and thence proceeds to be inserted into the olecranon. The triceps extends the forearm on the arm. A fourth muscle exists, which veterinary anatomists include in the study of the three portions of the triceps which we have just been discussing, in giving it the name of _small extensor of the forearm_. But, as this muscle is no other than the anconeus, and as, in human anatomy, we describe the latter, according to custom, in connection with the forearm, it is when on the subject of the latter that we will concern ourselves with it. This grouping of muscles cannot fail to give greater clearness to the description of the muscles of these regions. =The Supplemental or Accessory Muscle of the Latissimus Dorsi= (Fig. 76, 2; Fig. 77, 1).--Because of the relations, to which we have already referred (see p. 142), of this muscle with the triceps cubiti, its description very naturally follows that of the latter. Indeed, this supplementary muscle of the great dorsal is further designated in zoological anatomy under the name of _long extensor of the forearm_; and this name indicates that its study may be united to that of the triceps. Situated on the internal surface of the arm, it arises from the external aspect of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi; it is very highly developed in the horse, in which it also arises from the posterior border (axillary) of the scapula; then, covering in part the internal head of the triceps and also the long portion, on the superior border of which it is folded, it proceeds to be inserted into the olecranon process and the anti-brachial aponeurosis. It extends the forearm on the arm. Further, it makes tense the aponeurosis into which it is inserted; this explains the name of _tensor of the fascia of the forearm_, which is sometimes given to it. It seems to us interesting to add that, abnormally, we sometimes find in man an analogue of this muscle. It is given off from the latissimus dorsi, near the insertion of the latter into the humerus; it accompanies the long head of the triceps and becomes fused with it. Sometimes it is inserted into the olecranon process, at other times into the antibrachial aponeurosis or the epitrochlea. It is on account of its insertion into the last-mentioned, in some cases, that it is also designated by the name of _dorso-epitrochlear_ muscle.[25] [25] L.

Ãdouard Cuyer, 'Anomalies musculaires' (_Bulletins de la SociÃ©tÃ© Anthropologique_, Paris, 1893). Muscles of the Forearm Before commencing the special examination of each of the muscles of this region, it is absolutely indispensable to consider their general arrangement, and to determine very clearly how we should study them. We are too well convinced of the importance of this preliminary examination to dismiss it without entering rather fully into it. Indeed, the region on the myological study of which we are now entering is, unquestionably, one of the most complicated with which we have to deal. We know besides, in regard to the study of the forearm in man, how much a definite method is necessary in order that the arrangement of the muscles of this region be fixed in the memory, and that we are unable to obtain this result otherwise than by grouping the twenty muscles which constitute it in clearly defined regions. We also know that these muscles are first studied with the forearm in the position of supination, and that it is only when they are well known after having considered them in this position that we are able to analyze and comprehend their forms when it is in pronation. Now, as we have pointed out in the section on osteology (see p. 34), the forearm in quadrupeds is always in the position of pronation. Should we, then, in order to maintain the symmetry with human anatomy, first study the forearm in the position of supination? Evidently not. Besides the fact that this would in some cases be impossible since--as in the horse, for example--the radius and ulna are fused together, we should not gain any advantage; this position being never completely realizable even in those quadrupeds which have the radius relatively movable--as, for example, in the cat. Accordingly, it is pronation which here, in connection with animals, becomes the standard attitude from the point of view of description. This is why, supposing that the reader knows well the muscles of the human forearm in the position of supination, we should recall what is the general arrangement occupied by these muscles when it is in pronation. The fore-limb, being viewed on its anterior surface, presents above the anterior aspect of the region of the elbow; but below, it is the posterior surface of the wrist which is seen. Consequently, in the superior part, we see the external and anterior muscles limiting the hollow in front of the elbow; interiorly are found the posterior muscles. The long supinator, passing obliquely downwards and inwards, divides, in fact, the forearm into two parts: one supero-internal, the other infero-external. In the first we see, but to an extent less and less considerable, the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, and the flexor ulnaris; as to the flexors of the digits, on account of the rotation of the radius, they are only visible on the opposite surface--that is to say, on the surface of the wrist, which is now posterior. In the second part we see the two radial extensors, the common extensor of the fingers, the proper extensor of the little finger, and the ulnar extensor which, inferiorly, remains behind, by reason of the position of the ulna being unchanged, whilst the anconeus is wholly posterior, since the direction of the elbow is not modified. We also find, in this region, the long abductor of the thumb, the short extensor of the thumb, the long extensor of the thumb, and the special extensor of the index-finger, in the region where these deep muscles become superficial. So that, to summarize, the external and posterior muscles occupy the anterior and external regions of the forearm, whilst the anterior muscles occupy rather the internal and posterior. It is in regarding them after this manner--that is to say, arranged in these two regions--that we proceed to study these muscles in quadrupeds. Anterior and External Region =Supinator Longus.=--We know that this muscle, which is especially a flexor of the forearm on the arm, plays, notwithstanding the name which has been given it, a part of but little importance in the movement of supination. It acts slightly, however, as a supinator, for, being very oblique downwards and inwards at the time of pronation, it is able, while tending to resume its vertical direction, to carry the radius outwards; it places, in fact, the forearm in a position midway between pronation and supination. We have just recalled these details, in order that it may be more easy to understand why it does not exist in animals in which the radius and ulna are fused together (horse, ox); and why, on the other hand, we find traces of it in the cat and the dog, in which the radius--to a slight extent, it is true--is able to rotate on the ulna. This displacement being a little more considerable in the felide, the long supinator is a little further developed than it is in the canine species; but, notwithstanding, it is only rudimentary. The long supinator arises, above, from the external border of the humerus; thence, in the form of a very narrow fleshy band, it passes obliquely downwards and inwards, to be inserted into the inferior part of the internal surface of the radius. It assists in turning the radius outwards and placing it in front of the ulna, the movement of supination being capable of being but little further extended. =First and Second External Radial Muscles=: _Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior_ (Fig. 73, 8; Fig. 74, 8, 9; Fig. 75, 8, 9).--Fused together, these muscles form by their union what veterinary anatomists call _the anterior extensor of the metacarpus_. But we should add that these two muscles are united so much the more intimately as we examine them in passing successively from the cat to the dog, pig, ox, and horse. Thus, in the cat they are often distinct; in the dog, they unite only at the level of the middle third of the radius, and interiorly they have two tendons; in the pig, the ox, and the horse they are completely united, and there exists but a single tendon. The _anterior extensor of the metacarpus_, which is situated behind the long supinator when the latter exists, occupies the external aspect of the forearm; its well-defined form absolutely recalls the prominence on the superior part of the external margin of the human forearm. It arises superiorly from the portion of the external border of the humerus which is situated above the epicondyle and behind the musculo-spiral groove. Its fleshy mass appears in the angular space bounded by the brachialis anticus and the triceps. The superior portion is covered by the external head of the triceps; yet, in the dog, the superior portion of its humeral attachment is the only part so covered. This muscle is directed forward and downwards; it is also inclined a little inwards in such manner as to proceed to occupy the anterior aspect of the forearm. Its fleshy belly is narrowed below, and, towards the inferior part of the forearm, is continued by a tendinous portion which is situated on the anterior surface of the carpus, after having traversed the median groove of the inferior extremity of the radius. In the cat and the dog, in which the union of the two radial extensors is incomplete, the two tendons are inserted into the front of the base of the second and third metacarpal bones; consequently, as in man, into the metacarpals of the index and middle fingers. In the ox, the tendon, which is single, is inserted into the internal and anterior half of the superior extremity of the principal metacarpal. In the pig, this tendon is attached to the base of the large internal metacarpal. In the horse, the corresponding tendon is attached to a tubercle which is situated on the anterior surface of the base of the principal metacarpal, a little internal to the median plane of the latter. [Illustration: FIG. 73.--MYOLOGY OF THE DOG: LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB, EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Mastoido-humeralis; 2, biceps; 3, brachialis anticus; 4, triceps, long portion; 5, triceps, external head; 6, olecranon process; 7, epicondyle; 8, radialis muscles (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 9, extensor communis digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges); 10, extensor minimi digiti (lateral extensor of the phalanges, or common extensor of the three external digits); 11, posterior ulnar (external flexor of the metacarpus); 12, pisiform bone; 13, anconeus; 14, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii pollicis (oblique extensor of the metacarpus); 15, radius; 16, anterior ulnar (oblique flexor of the metacarpus); 17, external border of the hypothenar eminence (abductor of the little finger).] In order to properly understand and remember the respective positions occupied by these inferior insertions, it must be remembered that the human forearm being in the position of pronation, the tendons of the radials are attached to the bases of the metacarpals nearest to the thumb--that is to say, those occupying an internal position as regards the fourth and fifth metacarpals. As its name indicates, this muscle extends the metacarpus. Consequently it is, in the horse, an extensor of the canon-bone. It is also an adductor of the hand in those animals (cat, dog) in which the radio-carpal articulation, analogous in form to the corresponding articulation in man, permits lateral movements of the hand on the forearm. The union of the fleshy bodies of the two radials is sometimes found in the human species. =Supinator Brevis.=--As in the case of the long supinator, the short supinator is found only in animals in which the radius can be rotated to a greater or less extent around the ulna; therefore this muscle is not found in the pig, the ox, or the horse; but it forms part of the forearm of the cat and the dog. Deeply situated at the region of the elbow, the short supinator has little interest for us. All that we will say of it is that it goes from the external part of the inferior extremity of the humerus to the superior part of the radius; and that it is, in carnivora, the essential agent in the production of the movement of supination. =Extensor Communis Digitorum= (Fig. 73, 9, 10, 11; Fig. 74, 10, 11, 12).--Also named in veterinary anatomy the _anterior extensor of the phalanges_, this muscle is situated external to and behind the anterior extensor of the metacarpus already described. In the human being, the common extensor of the fingers springs, in its superior part, from the bottom of a depression, situated on the outer side of and behind the elbow, and limited in front by the muscular prominence which the long supinator and the first radial extensor form at that level. At the bottom of this hollow or fossette is found the epicondyle, which gives origin, amongst other muscles, to the common extensor of the fingers. It is necessary to add that it is most prominently visible during supination, and that it tends to be effaced during pronation. [Illustration: FIG. 74.--MYOLOGY OF THE OX: LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB, EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Mastoido-humeralis; 2, pectoralis major; 3, deltoid; 4, brachialis anticus; 5, triceps; 6, triceps, external head; 7, olecranon; 8, radial extensors (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 9, insertion of the tendon of the anterior extensor of the metacarpus to the tubercle of the superior extremity of the principal metacarpal; 10, 11, extensor communis digitorum (10, proper extensor of the inner digits; 11, common extensor of the two digits); 12, tendon of the common extensor of the two digits; 13, band of reinforcement from the suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 14, external tuberosity of the superior extremity of the radius; 15, extensor minimi digiti (proper extensor of the external digit); 16, tendon of the proper extensor of the external digit; 17, posterior ulnar (external flexor of the metacarpus); 18, pisiform; 19, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii pollicis (oblique extensor of the metacarpus); 20, ulnar portion of the deep flexor of the toes; 21, tendon of the superficial flexor of the toes (superficial flexor of the phalanges); 22, tendon of the deep flexor of the toes (deep flexor of the phalanges); 23, suspensory ligament of the fetlock.] An analogous arrangement is met with in animals. But the muscular prominence is formed by the united radial extensors, and the fossette, because of the permanent pronation of the forearm, is scarcely recognisable. Likewise, with regard to the dog, we may say that it does not exist, on account of the prominence which the epicondyle forms in that animal (Fig. 73, 7). In connection with this prominence of the epicondyle, it is interesting to add that this detail recalls the relief which the same process produces on the external aspect of the human elbow when the forearm is flexed on the arm. We know that, in this case, the epicondyle is exposed, because the muscles which mask it in supination (long supinator and long radial extensor) are displaced and set it free during flexion. But, in the dog, as in other quadrupeds besides, the forearm is, in the normal state, flexed on the arm; the latter being oblique downwards and backwards, and the former being vertical. Further, the epicondyle is well developed. The muscle with which we are now occupied, long and vertical in direction, arises from the inferior part of the external border of the humerus (there it is covered by the anterior extensor of the metacarpus, from which it is freed a little lower down) and from the external and superior tuberosity of the radius. In the carnivora, it arises from the epicondyle. Its fleshy body is fusiform in shape, becomes tendinous in the lower half of the forearm, and then divides into a number of slips, varying in number according to the species; this division is correlated to that of the hand--that is to say, with the number of the digits. Before reaching this latter, the common extensor of the digits passes through the most external groove on the anterior surface of the inferior extremity of the radius. [Illustration: FIG. 75.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB, EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Mastoido-humeral; 2, pectoralis major; 3, deltoid; 4, brachialis anticus; 5, triceps, long head; 6, triceps, external head; 7, olecranon; 8, radial extensors (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 9, insertion of the tendon of the anterior extensor of the metacarpus into the tubercle of the superior extremity of the principal metacarpal; 10, extensor communis digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges); 11, tendon of the anterior extensor of the phalanges; 12, reinforcing band arising from the suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 13, external tuberosity of the superior extremity of the radius; 14, extensor minimi digiti (lateral extensor of the phalanges); 15, tendon of the lateral extensor of the phalanges; 16, fibrous band which this latter receives from the tendon of the anterior extensor of the phalanges; 17, fibrous band which the same tendon receives from the carpal region; 18, posterior ulnar (external flexor of the metacarpus); 19, pisiform; 20, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii pollicis (oblique flexor of the metacarpus); 21, ulnar portion of the deep flexor of the digits; 22, flexor digitorum profundus; 23, 23, tendon of the flexor digitorum sublimis (superficial flexor of the phalanges); 24, 24, tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus (deep flexor of the phalanges); 25, sesamoid prominence; 26, suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 27, external rudimentary metacarpal.] In the cat and the dog, the four tendons which result from the division of the principal tendon go to the four last digits, and each of them is inserted, as in the human species, to the second and third phalanges. In the pig, the anterior extensor of the phalanges is rather complicated in its arrangement. Its fleshy body is divided into four bundles terminated by tendons, which in turn divide and join certain digits; whence the special names given to each of these fasciculi, commencing with the most internal, of: _proper extensor of the great inner toe_; _common extensor of the two inner toes_; _common extensor of the two outer toes_; and _proper extensor of the great outer toe_. In the ox, the same muscle is divided into two bundles: the internal proceeds to the internal toe, the external is common to the two toes. In the horse, the tendon of the anterior extensor of the phalanges is divided into two parts of unequal bulk. The smaller of these tendinous slips, which is the more external, unites at the level of the superior part of the metacarpus with the tendon of the muscle which we are about to study in the following paragraph (Fig. 75, 16). The larger, after having reached the anterior surface of the digit, is attached to the anterior aspect of the first and second phalanges, and then forms a terminal expansion which is inserted into the pyramidal eminence of the third. At the level of the first phalanx this tendon receives on each of its lateral aspects a strengthening band, which proceeds from the terminal extremity of _the suspensory ligament of the fetlock_,[26] and crosses obliquely downwards and forwards over the surface of the first phalanx to join the extensor tendon (Fig. 75, 12). [26] See p. 200 for a description of this ligament. A similar arrangement is found in the ox. This band is noticeable under the skin which covers the lateral aspects of the ham. As the name indicates, this muscle extends the phalanges, one upon the other. It also contributes to the extension of the hand, as a whole, on the forearm. =Extensor Minimi Digiti= (Fig. 73, 10; Fig. 74, 15, 16; Fig. 75, 14, 15).--This muscle, _the lateral extensor of the phalanges_ of veterinary anatomy, situated on the external surface of the forearm, behind the common extensor of the digits, arises, as a rule, from the epicondyle (dog, cat), or from the external surface of the superior extremity of the radius (horse). The tendon succeeding to the fleshy body appears towards the lower third of the forearm, and at the level of the wrist lies in a groove analogous to that which in man is hollowed out for the passage of the corresponding tendon at the level of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation. This groove corresponds to the same articulation in animals in which the ulna is well developed, such as the dog and the cat; but it belongs to the radius when the inferior extremity of the ulna does not exist--for example, in the horse. Indeed, in this animal the groove in question is found on the external surface of the carpal extremity of the radius. In the dog, the tendon is divided into three parts, which, crossing obliquely the tendons of the common extensor of the digits, pass to the three external digits, to be inserted by blending with the corresponding tendons of the latter into the third phalanges of those digits. Thus is explained the name of _common extensor of the three external digits_ which is sometimes given to this muscle. In the cat, there is a fourth tendon, which passes to the index-finger, so that the name _common extensor of the four external digits_ is in this case legitimate, and the lateral extensor of the phalanges is also a common extensor, as is the anterior extensor of the phalanges, or common extensor of the digits. In the pig, the tendon, which is single, is inserted into the external digit, for which reason it has received the name of the _proper extensor of the small external digit_. This muscle is, then, really the homologue of that which exists in the human species. In the ox, it is called the _proper extensor of the external digit_; it is as thick as the common extensor. Finally, in the horse, the muscle is little developed. Its fleshy body, thin and flattened from before backwards, becomes distinctly visible only below the middle of the forearm. Above, it is enclosed in a limited space, bounded in front by the common extensor of the digits, and behind by the posterior ulnar; there these two muscles approach each other so closely that from the point of view of external form they seem to be nearly in contact. The tendon, after receiving the small fasciculus from the common extensor (Fig. 75, 16), as well as a fibrous band emanating from the external surface of the carpus (Fig. 75, 17), is situated at the external side of the tendon of the anterior extensor of the phalanges, and is inserted into the anterior surface of the superior extremity of the first phalanx. This muscle extends the digit or digits into which it is inserted. It also assists in the movement of extension of the hand as a whole. =Posterior Ulnar= (_Extensor carpi ulnaris_) (Fig. 73, 11; Fig. 74, 17; Fig. 75, 18).--Designated by veterinary anatomists as the _external flexor of the metacarpus_,[27] or _external cubital_, this muscle is situated in the posterior region of the external surface of the forearm, behind the lateral extensor of the phalanges. [27] Certain authors give it the name of _ulnar extensor of the wrist_. It is true that in the human being this is its action; but in quadrupeds, owing to its insertion into the pisiform, it draws the hand into the position of flexion. It arises from the epicondyle; its fleshy body, thick but flattened, is directed vertically towards the carpus, and its tendon is inserted into the external part of the superior extremity of the metacarpus, after having given off a fibrous band, which takes its attachment on the pisiform. It is inserted, in the cat and the dog, into the superior extremity of the fifth metacarpal; in the pig to the external metacarpal; in the ox to the external side of the canon-bone; in the horse to the superior extremity of the external rudimentary metacarpal. This muscle flexes the hand on the forearm, and in animals in which the radio-carpal articulation permits, by its formation, it inclines the hand slightly outwards--that is, abducts it. =Anconeus= (Fig. 72, 17; Fig. 73, 13).--We have already stated (p. 174) that the anconeus is included with the triceps brachialis in zoological anatomy, and that veterinary anatomists give it the name of _small extensor of the forearm_.[28] [28] It is also called by some authors, the _small anconeus_. In the dog it recalls, as to position, the human anconeus, but with this difference--that, in the latter, the anconeus, triangular in outline, has one of its angles turned outwards (the epicondyloid attachment) and one of its sides turned towards the olecranon. Here it is entirely the opposite. The anconeus, similarly triangular, is broader externally. At this level it takes its origin from the external border of the humerus, the epicondyle, and the external lateral ligament of the articulation of the elbow; thence its fibres converge towards the external surface of the olecranon, to be there inserted. It is in relation, anteriorly and inferiorly, with the posterior ulnar muscle. It is covered superiorly by the external head of the triceps. In the cat the disposition of the anconeus is analogous. But in the other quadrupeds with which we are here concerned it is completely covered by the external head of the triceps. It really participates in the formation of the triceps; and seeing that it takes origin from the posterior surface of the humerus at the margin of the olecranon fossa (Fig. 72), and proceeds thence towards the olecranon to be inserted, we can understand why veterinary anatomists have connected its study with that of the posterior muscular mass of the arm. This muscle is an extensor of the forearm on the arm. We proceed now to inquire what the deep muscles of the posterior region of the human forearm become in quadrupeds: the long abductor of the thumb, the short extensor of the thumb, the long extensor of the thumb, the proper extensor of the index. We know that in every instance these muscles, which are deeply seated at their origin, become superficial afterwards. In quadrupeds, on account of the position in which the forearm is placed--viz., pronation--the corresponding muscles occupy the anterior aspect of this region. =Long Abductor of the Thumb= (_Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis_) =and Short Extensor of the Thumb= (_Extensor primi internodii pollicis_) (Fig. 73, 14; Fig. 74, 19; Fig. 75, 20).--United one to the other in man, blended in quadrupeds, they form in the latter the muscles to which veterinary anatomists give the name of _oblique extensor of the metacarpus_. This muscle arises from the median portion of the skeleton of the forearm. There it is covered by the common extensor of the digits and that of the small digit (anterior extensor and lateral extensor of the phalanges). Then, at the internal border of the first of these muscles, it becomes superficial, passes downwards and inwards, crosses superficially the anterior extensor of the metacarpus, reaches the inferior extremity of the radius, and becomes lodged in the most internal of the grooves situated on the anterior surface of this extremity, passes on the internal side of the carpus, and is inserted into the superior extremity of the most internal metacarpal--that is, to the first metacarpal, or metacarpal of the thumb--in the dog and cat; to the internal rudimentary metacarpal in the horse. It is an extensor of the metacarpal into which it is inserted; but as, if we recall the extreme examples given above, in the dog the first metacarpal is not very mobile, and in the horse the internal rudimentary metacarpal is absolutely fixed to the bone which it accompanies, it is more exact to add that this muscle is principally an extensor of the metacarpus as a whole. And yet, in the cat and the dog, it is also able to adduct the first metacarpal bone. It must be understood that this movement would be abduction, if the hand could be placed in the position of complete supination, as in the human species. =Long Extensor of the Thumb= (_Extensor secundi internodii pollicis_) =and Proper Extensor of the Index= (_Extensor indicis_).--These two muscles are blended together by their fleshy bodies, so that the single name of _proper extensor of the thumb and index_ is preferable. This muscle is but of slight importance from our point of view, for it is extremely atrophied, and so much the more as the number of the digits is lessened. It arises, as the preceding, from the skeleton of the forearm, and there it is deeply placed. Below, towards the carpus, its tendinous part becomes superficial, to end in the following manner: In the carnivora, the tendon divides into two very slender parts, which are inserted into the thumb and the index. In the pig, the tendon is blended with that of the common extensor of the internal digits. Finally, in the ox and the horse, it is sometimes regarded as being blended with the common or anterior extensor of the phalanges. But to us it appears more rational to say that it does not exist, which, moreover, is explained by the digital simplification of the hand. Internal and Posterior Region =Pronator Teres= (Fig. 76, 8).--This muscle, as may easily be understood, undergoes, as do the supinators, a degree of degeneration in proportion to the loss of mobility of the radius on the ulna. In animals in which the bones of the forearm are not fused it exists; in those, on the other hand, in which this segment has become simply a supporting column, it is not developed--at least, in a normal manner. It is, consequently, found best marked in the dog and the cat. Forming, as in man, the internal limit of the hollow of the elbow, the pronator teres has a disposition analogous to that which characterizes the corresponding muscle in the human species. It arises from the epitrochlea (internal condyle), proceeds downwards and outwards, and is inserted into the middle portion of the body of the radius. It is into the hollow in front of the elbow, which this muscle contributes to limit, that the biceps and the brachialis anticus dip. In the pig and the ox it is atrophied. In the horse it does not exist. We may, however, sometimes find it, but in an abnormal form. We were able to demonstrate its presence in the form of a fleshy tongue situated on the internal side of the elbow (Fig. 78) in a horse which we dissected many years ago in the laboratory of the School of Fine Arts. Moreover--and the fact seemed to us an interesting one--the forearm to which the muscle belonged had an ulna of relatively considerable development (Figs. 79 and 80).[29] [29] Ãdouard Cuyer, 'Abnormal Length of the Ulna and Presence of a Pronator Teres Muscle in a Horse' (_Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© d'Anthropologie_, Paris, 1887). This muscle is a pronator. =Flexor Carpi Radialis= (Fig. 76, 10; Fig. 77, 7).--Called by veterinary anatomists _the internal flexor of the metacarpus_, this muscle, which is found on the internal aspect of the forearm, is situated behind the pronator teres when this muscle exists, whilst in the animals which are deprived of the latter the flexor carpi radialis has in front of it the internal border of the radius, which separates it from the anterior extensor of the metacarpus. It is necessary to add that the flexor carpi radialis is similarly separated from the anterior extensor of the metacarpus by the internal border of the radius in animals in which the pronator teres exists, but then only in that part of the forearm which is situated below this latter. The flexor carpi radialis arises from the epitrochlea. Its fleshy body, fusiform in shape, descends vertically, and terminates in a tendon on the posterior surface of the bases of the second and third metacarpals in the dog and the cat, on the metacarpal of the large internal digit in the pig, on the internal side of the metacarpus in the ox, and on the superior extremity of the internal rudimentary metacarpal in the horse. We see clearly, in this latter, a superficial vein which, in the shape of a strong cord, passes along the anterior border of the flexor carpi radialis; it is the subcutaneous median or internal vein, which, forming the continuation of the internal metacarpal vein, joins the venous system of the arm, after having crossed obliquely the corresponding part of the radius. =Palmaris Longus.=--This muscle, which exists distinctly in some animals, but whose absence is far from being rare in the human species, is not developed as a distinct muscle in any of the domestic quadrupeds. [Illustration: FIG. 76.--MYOLOGY OF THE DOG: LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB, INTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Biceps; 2, long extensor of the forearm (supplementary or accessory muscle of the great dorsal); 3, triceps, long head; 4, triceps, internal head; 5, olecranon; 6, epitrochlea (internal condyle); 7, radial extensors (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 8, pronator teres; 9, radius; 10, flexor carpi radialis (internal flexor of the metacarpus); 11, anterior ulnar (oblique flexor of the metacarpus); 12, superficial flexor of the digits; 13, deep flexor of the digits; 14, flexor longus pollicis (radial fasciculus of the deep flexor of the digits); 15, pisiform bone.] And yet some authors announce its presence in the dog, and describe it as becoming detached, in the form of a cylindrical bundle, from the anterior surface of the fleshy mass of the deep flexor of the digits (see p. 196) to proceed then by a tendon which divides into two parts, to terminate in the palm of the hand, where it blends with the tendons of the superficial flexor, which are destined for the third and fourth digits. These authors give to this muscle the name of _palmaris longus_, and attribute to it the action of flexing the hand. =Anterior Ulnar= (_Flexor carpi ulnaris_) (Fig. 73, 16; Fig. 76, 11; Fig. 77, 8).--Called by veterinary anatomists the _oblique flexor of the metacarpus_, or _internal ulnar_, this muscle occupies the internal part of the posterior aspect of the forearm in the ox and the horse, while in the dog it occupies rather the external part. This difference arises from the fact that in this latter, as in man, the anterior ulnar is separated from the flexor carpi radialis by an interval in which we see, on the internal aspect of the forearm, just at the level of the elbow, the flexors of the digits. This interval is so much the wider as there is no palmaris muscle to subdivide its extent (Fig. 81). In the horse, the interval in question does not exist. In this animal, indeed, the anterior ulnar is in contact with the radial flexor, so that this muscle can occupy only a region belonging rather to the internal surface of the forearm (Fig. 82). In the dog the anterior ulnar is in contact with the posterior ulnar. This relation recalls that which is found in man, where the two muscles are merely separated by the crest of the ulna (Fig. 81). But in the horse, in which the anterior ulnar has, so to speak, slid towards the internal aspect, this muscle is separated above from the posterior ulnar, and it is in the interval separating these two muscles that we are able to perceive, but this time at the back of the forearm, the muscular mass of the flexors of the digits (Fig. 82). [Illustration: FIG. 77.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: ANTERIOR LIMB, LEFT SIDE, INTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Long extensor of the forearm (supplementary or accessory muscle of the latissimus dorsi); 2, radialis muscles (anterior extensor of the metacarpus); 3, tendons of extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis extensor primi internodii pollicis united (oblique extensor of the metacarpus); 4, tendon of extensor communis digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges); 5, strengthening band from the suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 6, internal surface of the radius; 7, flexor carpi radialis (internal flexor of the metacarpus); 8, anterior ulnar (oblique flexor of the metacarpus); 9, pisiform bone; 10, 10, tendon of the superficial flexor of the digits (superficial flexor of the phalanges); 11, 11, tendon of the deep flexor of the digits (deep flexor of the phalanges); 12, sesamoid prominence; 13, suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 14, internal rudimentary metacarpal.] The anterior ulnar arises above from the epitrochlea and the olecranon; thence it is directed towards the carpus, to be inserted into the pisiform bone. It proceeds therefore from the inner side of the elbow to the outer side of the upper part of the hand; it consequently crosses the posterior surface of the forearm obliquely. This is why, as we have pointed out above, it receives the name of the oblique flexor of the metacarpus. It is not unprofitable to recall in this connection that there is an internal flexor of the metacarpus, which is the flexor carpi radialis; and an external flexor of the metacarpus, which is the posterior ulnar (in human anatomy, extensor carpi ulnaris). It is between these two muscles that we find the oblique flexor--the anterior ulnar which we have just been studying. This muscle flexes the hand on the forearm. =Superficial Flexor of the Digits= (_Flexor digitorum sublimis_) (Fig. 76, 12; Fig. 77, 10, 10).--This muscle arises from the epitrochlea; thence it passes towards the hand, becomes tendinous, passes in a groove on the posterior aspect of the carpus, and terminates on the palmar surface of the phalanges in furnishing a number of tendons proportioned to the digital division of the hand. Whatever the number, to which we will again refer, each tendon is attached to the second phalanx, after bifurcating at the level of the first, so as to form a sort of ring, destined to give passage to the corresponding tendon of the deep flexor. This ring and this passage have gained for the muscle the name of _perforated flexor_. In the dog and the cat the principal tendon is divided into four parts, which go to the four last digits. In the ox it is divided into two parts only; as, moreover, in the pig, whose superficial flexor is destined for the two large digits only, the lateral digits receiving no part of it. Finally, in the horse the tendon is single. We have previously pointed out that in the carnivora this muscle is visible on the internal and posterior aspects of the forearm, in the interval which is limited in front by the flexor carpi radialis and behind and outside by the anterior ulnar. Certain details are still to be added to the description of this muscle. We will enter on an analysis of them after we have given some indications relative to the following muscle: =Deep Flexor of the Digits= (_Flexor digitorum profundus_) (Fig. 75, 21, 22; Fig. 76, 12; Fig. 77, 11, 11).--This muscle is covered by the superficial flexor. It arises from the epitrochlea, from the radius, and from the ulna, either from the olecranon process--as in the ox, pig, and horse--or from almost the whole extent of the shaft of the same bone, as in the cat and dog. [Illustration: FIG. 78.--LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE: INTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Internal flexor of the metacarpus or great palmar; 2, inferior part of the biceps; 3, inferior part of the brachialis anticus; 4, internal lateral ligament of the elbow; 5, pronato teres muscle.] The radial fasciculus represents in the domestic quadrupeds the long proper flexor muscle of the thumb in man. For this reason we shall describe the muscle afresh in the following paragraph: The fleshy bundles of which we have just spoken terminate in a tendon which afterwards divides into slips, the number of which is in proportion to the digital division of the hand. These slips then pass through the slit or _buttonhole_ in the tendon of the superficial flexor, and proceed to terminate on the third phalanx; hence the name of _perforating_, which is also given to the deep flexor of the digits. In the dog and the cat the tendon is divided into five portions, each of which proceeds to one of the digits. The internal tendon, which is destined for the thumb, terminates on the second phalanx of this digit. In the pig the tendon divides into four tendons destined for the four digits. In the ox there are but two tendons. In the horse the tendon is single. As their names indicate, these muscles, both superficial and deep, flex the digits. In addition to this, they flex the hand on the forearm. We mentioned above that certain details relative to the superficial flexor must be analyzed in a special way. We now add that this should also be done with regard to the deep flexor. The point in question is the arrangement which the tendons of these muscles present at the level of the palmar region of the hand. It is easy, in the case of the dog or the cat, to picture to one's self this arrangement, especially if we recollect that which exists in the human species. The tendons of the flexors are placed on a kind of muscular bed formed by the union of the muscles of the region, but, moreover, from the point of view of external form, these tendons are not of very great importance. But in the ox and the horse it is quite otherwise. From the simplification of the skeleton of the hand, and the reduction of the number of movements which the bones that form it are able to execute, there naturally results a diminution of its muscular apparatus. Apart from the existence of muscular vestiges of but little importance, we can say that, in reality, the hand does not possess any muscles. On its palmar aspect are found only the tendons of the flexors of the digits, and as these tendons are large, and the hand long, they give origin to external forms which it is necessary to examine. [Illustration: FIG. 79.--LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE: EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Ulna of abnormal length.] [Illustration: FIG. 80.--LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE: EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Normal ulna.] In the horse, which we take as a type, the tendons of the flexors, after being retained in position at the carpus by a fibrous band, the _carpal sheath_, which recalls the anterior annular ligament of the human carpus, and having passed this region, descend vertically, remaining separated from the posterior surface of the metacarpus, so that the skin sinks slightly on the lateral parts in front of the thick cord which these tendons form. This cord is known by the name of _tendon_. The flexors then reach the fetlock, and occupy the groove formed by the peculiar arrangement of the two large sesamoid bones. They are retained in position at this level by a fibrous structure, which forms the metacarpo-phalangeal sheath. They then reach the phalanges, being directed obliquely downwards and forwards, as, moreover, the latter are also inclined. Then the tendon of the superficial flexor divides into two slips, which are inserted into the second phalanx, between which slips passes the tendon of the deep flexor, which in its turn goes to be inserted, in the form of an expansion, into the semilunar crest, by which the inferior surface of the third phalanx is divided into two parts.[30] [30] See, as regards this crest, in the paragraph relative to the hoof of the solipeds, the figures which represent the third phalanx, viewed on its inferior surface (Figs. 101 and 102, p. 258). The part which these tendons play is of great importance in the large quadrupeds. These tendons, in fact, in addition to the action determined by the contraction of the fleshy fibres to which they succeed, maintain the angle formed by the canon-bone and the phalangeal portion of the hand, and prevent its effacement under the weight of the body during the time of standing. Their strong development, and the position they occupy, make this understood, without it being necessary to insist on it further. We mentioned above that the 'tendon' descends vertically from the carpus towards the fetlocks. This is as it should be. But, in some horses, it is oblique downwards and backwards, so that the canon, instead of being of equal depth from before backwards in its whole length, is a little narrower in its upper part. This results from the fact that the tendons of the flexors, too firmly bound by the carpal sheath, gradually separate as they pass from the metacarpus, going to join the fetlock; hence the obliquity pointed out above. This abnormality producing a deleterious result, in the sense that the tendinous apparatus acts with less strength as an organ of support, it constitutes a defect of conformation which is expressed by saying that the tendon has 'failed.' =Long Proper Flexor of the Thumb= (_Flexor longus pollicis_) (Fig. 76, 14).--As we have already pointed out, this muscle is represented in quadrupeds by the radial bundle of the deep flexor of the digits, so that the two muscles are in reality blended the one to the other. This union is sometimes found, but only as an abnormality, in the human species. We have met some examples of this in the course of our dissections. =Pronator Quadratus.=--This muscle conforms to the general law which we have already pointed out in connection with those which have for their action the rotation of the radius around the ulna. We remember, indeed, that when the bones of the forearm are fused with one another, the muscles which are destined to produce a mobility which has then become impossible disappear at the same blow. [Illustration: FIG. 81.--DIAGRAM OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF A TRANSVERSE SECTION PASSING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE LEFT FORE-LIMB OF THE DOG: SURFACE OF THE INFERIOR SEGMENT OF THE SECTION. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, posterior ulnar; 4, anterior ulnar; 5, great palmar (_flexor carpi radialis_); 6, flexors of the digits.] [Illustration: FIG. 82.--DIAGRAM OF A HORIZONTAL SECTION OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREARM OF THE LEFT LEG OF THE HORSE: SURFACE OF THE INFERIOR SEGMENT OF THE SECTION. 1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, posterior ulnar; 4, anterior ulnar; 5, great palmar (_flexor carpi radialis_); 6, flexors of the digits.] For this cause we do not find the square pronator in either the ox or the horse, but can demonstrate its presence in the dog and the cat. It is very deeply situated. This is why, and also on account of the plan which we have traced for ourselves, we will simply say that it is situated on the postero-internal aspect of the skeleton of the forearm, and that it extends from the ulna to the radius. It seems to us, however, sufficiently interesting to add that, instead of occupying, as in the human species, the inferior fourth of the two bones, it extends, particularly in the dog, over their whole length, with the exception of their superior and inferior extremities. Muscles of the Hand We will first recall that, in man, the palm of the hand is divided into three regions: a median palmar region, which is occupied by the tendons of the flexors of the digits, the lumbricales, and, deeply, by the interosseous muscles; an external region, or thenar eminence, formed by the muscles destined for the movements of the thumb; an internal region, or hypothenar eminence, which contains the muscles proper to the small digit and the palmar cutaneous muscle. These muscles are found, more or less developed, in the dog and the cat. In the ox and the horse we meet with no vestige of the muscles of the thenar or hypothenar eminences. Nevertheless, in these animals we find the muscles which belong to the central region of the palm. We refer to the lumbricales and the interosseous. Although this fact has no relation to the object of our study, it appears to us interesting to announce that there are traces of the lumbricales found in the solipeds. These muscles are represented by two fleshy bundles, situated one on each side of the tendon of the deep flexor, above the ring of the tendon of the superficial flexor. These small muscles are continued as slender tendons, which become lost in the fibrous tissue of the _spur_, which is the horny process situated at the posterior part of the fetlock, and which is covered by the hairs, more or less abundant, which constitute the _wisp_. As for the interosseous muscles, they are represented by the _suspensory ligament of the fetlock_, and by two other small muscles, tendinous throughout, which are situated between the principal metacarpal and the rudimentary ones. The suspensory ligament of the fetlock is considered an interosseous muscle, on account of the red fleshy striations which it contains, and from certain relations which it forms with the tendon of the common extensor of the digits or anterior extensor of the phalanges. This ligament (Fig. 75, 26; Fig. 77, 13), which plays an important part in the standing position as a support of the foot, is a fibrous band situated between the tendons of the flexors of the digits and the principal metacarpal. It arises above, from the second row of the carpals, descends towards the fetlock, where it divides into two branches, which are inserted into the large sesamoid bones. At the same level, this ligament gives off two fibrous bands which, passing downwards and forwards, join the tendon of the anterior extensor of the phalanges, blending with it, after having each crossed one of the lateral aspects of the pastern. We have already referred to these bands (p. 183). It is with these latter that are blended the long and slender tendons which form in a great measure the two other interosseous muscles previously described. A ligament of the same kind is found in the ox (Fig. 74, 23). MUSCLES OF THE POSTERIOR LIMBS Muscles of the Pelvis The muscles which specially interest us in this region, because of their superficial position, are the gluteus maximus and the gluteus medius. As for the gluteus minimus, it is deeply situated, and more or less sharply marked off from the second of the preceding muscles. Inasmuch as the gluteus medius is more simple in arrangement than the maximus, and will aid us in arranging our ideas in connection with the latter, it is with the study of it that we will commence. =Gluteus Medius= (Fig. 68, 29; Fig. 69, 26; Fig. 70, 35).--This muscle, as in man, occupies the external iliac fossa. But this latter being directed differently in the digitigrades and the ungulates, as we have pointed out in the section on osteology (see pp. 91 and 99), the muscle in question has consequently not the same direction in the two groups of animals, being turned outwards in the first, and upwards in the second. It is the thickest of the glutei, and gives to the region which it occupies a rounded form. From the iliac fossa from which it arises the fleshy fibres are directed towards the femur, to be inserted into the great trochanter. It is covered by an aponeurosis, and in part by the great gluteal. It completely covers the small gluteal, which veterinary anatomists designate by the name of the _deep gluteal_. In the carnivora it does not pass in front of the iliac crest, but, in the ox, and more particularly in the horse, it is prolonged anteriorly, and thus covers, to a certain extent, the muscles of the common mass. When it contracts, taking its fixed point at the pelvis, the gluteus medius extends the thigh, which it is also able to abduct. If, on the other hand, its fixed point is on the femur, it acts on the trunk, which it raises, producing oscillating movements of the pelvis. It contributes in this way to the action of rearing. We also see it distinctly appear by the prominence which it produces in the dog, which, according to the time-honoured phrase, _fait le beau_. =Gluteus Maximus= (Fig. 68, 28; Fig. 69, 25; Fig. 70, 33, 34).--The great gluteal muscle, further designated in veterinary anatomy the _superficial gluteal_, is proportionately less developed in quadrupeds than in man. Indeed, in the latter, where it is of very great thickness, its volume is due to the important function which it fulfils in maintaining the biped attitude. In quadrupeds it contributes to form the superficial part of the crupper and the external surface of the thigh. It is divided into two parts: one anterior, the other posterior. With regard to this latter, it will be necessary to indicate how it has been sometimes regarded, and to what portion of the muscular system in man it corresponds. But we believe that it is better to see beforehand, without any preconceived idea, how these two parts are arranged. In the dog, the anterior portion of the gluteus maximus arises from the sacrum, while some fibres situated further forward arise from the surface of the gluteus medius, near the iliac spine, and from the tensor of the fascia lata with which these fibres are blended. The posterior portion, united to the preceding--that is to say, to those of its fibres which arise from the sacrum--takes its origin from the first coccygeal vertebra. These two portions are directed towards the femur, to be inserted into the great trochanter, and to the external branch of the superior bifurcation of the linea aspera. In the cat, the posterior bundle is less definitely blended with the anterior. By a long and slender tendon which, behind, turns around the great trochanter, and passes along the surface of the fascia lata, it proceeds to join the knee-cap. In the pig, the posterior portion is much more developed. In the horse, the anterior portion arises from the internal iliac spine (posterior in man), from the external iliac spine (anterior in man), and, between these two osseous points, from the aponeurosis, which covers the gluteus medius. Between these two origins the muscle is deeply grooved, so that the tendency is to divide into two portions, each of which is directed towards one of the iliac angles. In this groove the gluteus medius is to be seen. The fleshy bundles converge, and are directed towards the external aspect of the femur, to be inserted into the osseous prominence known as the third trochanter, after passing beneath the fleshy fibres of the posterior portion. The latter, which is more considerable than the preceding portion, arises above from the sacral crest, from the aponeurosis which envelops the coccygeal muscles, from the sacro-sciatic ligament, and from the tuberosity of the ischium. From this origin it passes downwards, expands, then, describing a curve with the convexity behind, it becomes narrowed, and proceeds to be inserted by a deep fasciculus into the third trochanter, to the fascia lata, and, lastly, to the knee-cap by the inferior part of its tendon. Above, its posterior border is covered by the semi-tendinosus; interiorly, the same border is in relation with the biceps femoris. In the ox, the two parts of the great gluteal muscle are blended together. The long and broad fleshy band which they form arises in a manner corresponding to that which we have just indicated in connection with the horse, except that it has no attachment to the femur. The fascia lata adheres strongly to its anterior border for a considerable length. The form of the superior border of the great gluteal muscle of this animal differs from that of the analogous portion in the horse. This difference results from the peculiar aspect which the corresponding region of the pelvis presents, and from the fact that, in the ox, as the semi-tendinosus does not cover the portion of the great gluteal which arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, the attachments of this muscle to the sacro-sciatic ligament are uncovered. Its descending portion, as a whole, has a rectilinear form, and does not form a curve such as we indicated in the case of the horse. The anterior portion of the great gluteal flexes the thigh. As regards the posterior portion, it extends the thigh, and abducts it. The action of this latter portion is particularly interesting as regards the horse, because of the great development of the muscular mass which this region presents in this animal. If the muscle takes its fixed point above, it acts, in the extension of the thigh during walking, by projecting the trunk forward during the whole time that the hind-limb to which it belongs is in contact with the ground. If, on the contrary, it takes its fixed point below, it makes the pelvis describe a see-saw movement, upwards and backwards, on the coxo-femoral articulation, and so contributes to the action of rearing. Now that we have a knowledge of the disposition of the great gluteal muscle, the moment has come to inquire what is the signification of its posterior portion. The action of the anterior part being clearly comparable to the human great gluteal, there can be no doubt as regards the homology of this portion, so we will not insist on it further. Of the posterior portion it is wholly different, for it is the homologue of a fleshy bundle annexed to the great gluteal of man, but which is not developed except as an abnormality. Indeed, we sometimes find, placed along the inferior border of the great gluteal, a fleshy fasciculus, separated from this muscle by a slight interspace. This fasciculus, long and narrow, takes origin from the summit of the sacrum, or the coccyx, and goes to partake of the femoral insertions of the muscle which it accompanies. We further note a muscle of the same kind, and presenting the same aspect, which comes from the tuberosity of the ischium. Notwithstanding the difference which exists, it is this abnormal fasciculus of man which in the quadrupeds here studied is considered as constituting the posterior portion of the great gluteal. Bourgelat, considering this posterior portion as belonging to the biceps cruris, to which, it is true, it adheres, forms of them a muscle which he designates under the name of the _long vastus_. The anterior fasciculus of this long vastus is none other than the posterior portion of the great gluteal which we have just been studying. Muscles of the Thigh These muscles are divided into three regions: posterior, anterior, and internal. In a corresponding manner to that which we described in connection with the arm, the thigh is applied to the side of the trunk, and is free, more or less, only at the level of the inferior part. Further, by reason of this shortening of the femur, the great gluteal muscle, which is elongated in the ox and the horse, for example, occupies in part the region corresponding to that which in man is occupied by the muscles of the thigh, which here are reduced in length. In other words, they are not superposed, as in the human species, but juxtaposed. This is what we will verify further on. The thigh, as a whole, is flattened from without inwards, its transverse diameter being less in extent than its antero-posterior. Its external surface is slightly rounded; that is, of course, in quadrupeds with sufficiently well-developed muscles. Its internal surface is known as the _flat of the thigh_. Muscles of the Posterior Region It is not unprofitable to recall to mind what muscles form the superficial layer of this region in the human being. They are the biceps cruris, semi-tendinosus, and semi-membranosus. We now proceed to discover their analogues in quadrupeds. =Biceps Cruris= (Fig. 68, 30; Fig. 69, 27; Fig. 70, 36).--It is this which, according to Bourgelat, forms the central and posterior portions of the long vastus muscle which we have mentioned above. We know that the biceps of man is so named from the two portions which form its upper part. In domestic quadrupeds, and also in the majority of the mammals, this muscle is reduced to a single portion, that which comes from the pelvis. It is therefore the portion which arises from the femur which does not exist. This condition is sometimes found as an abnormality in the human species. The biceps arises from the tuberosity of the ischium; hence it is directed, widening as it goes, towards the leg, where it terminates by an aponeurosis which blends with the fascia lata and the aponeurosis of the leg, and then proceeds to be attached to the anterior border or crest of the tibia. By its inferior portion it limits externally the posterior region of the knee--the popliteal space. A fibrous intersection traverses the biceps in its whole length, with the result that the muscle looks as if formed of two portions, one of which is situated in front of the other. In the dog and the cat it also arises from the sacro-sciatic ligament. At this level its contour is distinguishable from that which corresponds to the gluteal muscles, so that we there find two prominences one above the other. The superior is formed by the gluteal muscles; the inferior corresponds to the tuberosity of the ischium. The two prominences are separated by a depression, from which the biceps emerges. We draw attention to this form, the character of which is so expressive of energy in the carnivora. In these animals the biceps is inserted, by its anterior fibres, into the articulation of the knee, while in the rest of its extent it covers in great measure by its aponeurosis the external aspect of the leg. In the pig, the biceps is but slightly marked off from the posterior part of the great gluteal. In the ox, the division between these two muscles is a little more distinct. In the horse, the sciatic origin of the biceps is covered by the semi-tendinosus, so that it only becomes free lower down, to appear in the space limited behind by the semi-tendinosus, and in front by the posterior part of the gluteus maximus. When the biceps contracts, taking its fixed point from above, it flexes the leg and helps to extend the thigh. If, on the other hand, it takes its fixed point from below, it lowers the ischium, makes the pelvis undergo a see-saw movement, and acts thus in the movement of rearing. It is sometimes called, on account of one of its actions, and the position which it occupies, the 'external flexor, or peroneal muscle of the leg.' =Semi-tendinosus= (Fig. 68, 31; Fig. 70, 37; Fig. 87, 1; Fig. 88, 1; Fig. 89, 28).--This muscle forms the contour of the thigh posteriorly, so that when the latter is viewed from the side, it is the semi-tendinosus above all that forms the outline. But, as we shall soon see, it is in this case more distinct above than below, because of the deviation which it undergoes in order to occupy by its inferior part the internal side of the leg. In the dog, the cat, and the ox, the semi-tendinosus arises from the tuberosity of the ischium only, as in the human species. In the pig, it also takes origin higher up from the sacro-sciatic ligament and the coccygeal aponeurosis. In the horse, it extends still further, for it is also attached to the crest of the sacrum. The indication of these origins is of importance from the point of view of external form, and to convince ourselves of this it is sufficient to compare, in the ox and the horse, the region of the pelvis situated below the root of the tail. In the ox, whose semi-tendinosus arises from the tuberosity of the ischium only, this region is depressed, and the cavity which is formed at this level is limited behind by the tuberosity, which we know is very thick and prominent above. This causes the superior part of the crupper to be less oblique than in the horse. This characteristic is more especially marked in the cow, the bull having this region of a more rounded form. In the horse, on account of the semi-tendinosus ascending to the coccyx, and even to the sacrum, the depression in question does not exist, and the presence of the tuberosity of the ischium is only slightly revealed. Descending from the origin indicated above, and inclining more and more inwards, the semi-tendinosus proceeds to blend with the aponeurosis of the leg, to be inserted into the anterior border of the tibia, after crossing over the internal surface of the latter. It forms the internal boundary of the popliteal space. When this muscle contracts, taking its fixed point at the pelvis, it flexes the leg. If, on the other hand, it takes its fixed point at the tibia, it makes the pelvis describe a see-saw movement, and acts accordingly in the movement of rearing. It is sometimes named the 'internal or tibial flexor of the leg,' in opposition to the crural biceps, which, as stated above, is then the external flexor of the same region. =Semi-membranosus= (Fig. 68, 32; Fig. 87, 2; Fig. 88, 2).--This muscle, situated on the inner side of the semi-tendinosus, can be seen only when the thigh is regarded on its posterior aspect. It is only by reason of the homology of situation with the corresponding muscle in man that we give the name under which we are studying it; indeed, its structure is different, for it does not present the long, broad, aponeurotic tendon which, in its superior part, characterizes this muscle in the human species. It arises above from the inferior surface of the ischium, and from the tuberosity of the same bone. In the pig, and especially in the horse, it passes further upwards, to arise from the aponeurosis of the coccygeal muscles. So that if we compare it with that of the ox, which does not extend beyond the ischium, we find that it is associated with the semi-tendinosus in determining the difference of aspect to which we have already called attention in connection with the region of the pelvis situated below the root of the tail. The semi-membranosus is then directed downwards and forwards, to take its place on the internal surface of the thigh, where it is partly covered by the gracilis muscle. It is inserted in the following manner: In the dog and the cat it is divided into two parts, anterior and posterior. The first, the more developed, is attached to the internal surface of the inferior extremity of the femur; the second to the internal tuberosity of the tibia. The same arrangement occurs in the ox. In the horse it is inserted into the internal surface of the internal condyle of the femur. The semi-membranosus is an extensor of the thigh when it takes its fixed point at the pelvis; it is also an adductor of the lower limb. If it takes its fixed point below it assists in the action of rearing. It is now necessary for us, especially as regards the horse, to add some indications relative to the exterior forms of the region constituted by the semi-membranosus and semi-tendinosus. These two muscles form, by their union, a surface contour, slightly projecting and of elongated form, which occupies the posterior border of the thigh, the contour corresponding to the region known as the _buttock_, in spite of the fact that none of the gluteal muscles take any part in the structure of this region. But the appearances, to a certain extent, justify the preservation of this name. Indeed, because of the groove which separates the gluteal region of one side from that of the opposite side, and from the position of the anal orifice in the superior part of this groove, we may admit the name which, in hippology, has been given to this part of the thigh. In addition to the reasons just given, and which are justified especially by the position occupied by the muscular mass formed by the union of the two muscles, there is another which, this time, has a relation to a certain detail of form. In the superior part of the convexity, which the gluteal region describes in the greater part of its extent, there is found a more salient point, greatly accentuated in lean animals, due to the presence of the tuberosity of the ischium; it is the _point_ or _angle of the buttock_. At this level, and near the median line, the semi-membranosus, not aponeurotic, but fleshy, and even thicker there than anywhere else, sometimes produces a sharply localized prominence. And as this prominence is situated on the outer side of the anal orifice, the resemblance to a small 'buttock' is still more marked. In lean horses a deep groove separates the mass formed by the semi-membranosus and semi-tendinosus from that of the other muscles of the thigh situated more in front; this groove is known by a name which in this case is remarkably expressive--that of the 'line of poverty.' If we examine the gluteal region as a whole by looking at the thigh from the side, we plainly see the graceful curve produced by the general convexity above indicated. We return to this point, in order to add that, in its lower part, this curve alters its character; that is to say, it is replaced by a slight concavity. This, which is designated under the name of _the fold of the buttock_, is situated close to the level of articulation of the leg with the thigh-bone. Muscles of the Anterior Region First we recall that in man the anterior muscles of the thigh are: the triceps cruris, the tensor of the fascia lata, and the sartorius. =Triceps Cruris= (Fig. 8, 36; Fig. 69, 31; Fig. 70, 41; Fig. 84, 2; Fig. 87, 3; Fig. 88, 3).--This muscle, which occupies the greater part of the space between the pelvis and the anterior aspect of the femur, consists of three parts: an external, or vastus externus; an internal, or vastus internus; and a median or long portion, or rectus femoris. This division accordingly recalls that which characterizes the human triceps cruris. Furthermore, as in the case of the latter, the vastus externus and the vastus internus take their origin from the shaft of the femur, while the long portion arises from the pelvis. The _vastus externus_ arises from the external lip of the linea aspera of the femur (or from the external border of the posterior surface of this bone in the ox and the horse, in which the linea aspera, considerably widened, especially in the latter, forms a surface), and from the external surface of the shaft of the femur. From this origin its fibres pass downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the tendon of the long portion of the muscle and into the patella. In the dog and the cat the vastus externus is the most voluminous of the three portions which constitute the triceps muscle. It is covered by the fascia lata; but notwithstanding this, its presence is revealed by a prominence which occupies the external surface of the thigh, and surmounts, in the region of the knee, the more slightly developed one which is produced by the knee-cap. The _vastus internus_, situated on the inner surface of the thigh, takes its origin from the corresponding surface of the femur, and proceeds towards the patella. The rectus femoris arises from the iliac bone, above the cotyloid cavity; its fleshy body, which is fusiform, and situated in front of and between the two vasti muscles, is directed towards the patella, into which it is inserted by a tendon, which receives the other two portions. It is covered in front by the tensor of the fascia lata, and contributes with the vastus externus to form the upper prominence of the knee. The ligamentous fibres, which, as in man, unite the knee-cap to the tibia, transmit to this latter the action determined by the contraction of the triceps. This muscle is an extensor of the leg. Furthermore, the rectus femoris, or long portion, acts as a flexor of the thigh. =Tensor Fascia Lata= (Fig. 68, 34, 36; Fig. 69, 30, 31; Fig. 70, 40).--This muscle, generally larger in quadrupeds than in man, is flat and triangular, and occupies the superior and anterior part of the thigh. It arises from the anterior iliac spine (inferior in carnivora, external in the ox and the horse); it is prolonged downwards by an aponeurosis (fascia lata) which occupies the external aspect of the thigh, proceeds to be inserted into the patella and blend with the aponeurosis of the biceps muscle. It covers the rectus and vastus externus portions of the triceps cruris; it is also in relation with the gluteal muscles. The tensor of the fascia lata flexes the thigh, and serves to raise the lower limb as a whole. =Sartorius= (Fig. 68, 35; Fig. 87, 4, 5; Fig. 88, 5).--This muscle, long and flattened, is called by veterinarians _the long adductor of the leg_. Before beginning the study of its position in quadrupeds, it is necessary to remember that in man, where the thigh has a form almost conical, the sartorius commences on the anterior face of this latter, and is directed downwards and inwards to reach the internal surface of the knee. But now let us suppose the thigh flattened from without inwards; there will evidently result from this a change in situation with regard to the muscle in question. In fact, when this supposition is admitted, it is easy to imagine that in a great part of the extent in which the sartorius is normally anterior it will become internal. This is why, these conditions being realized in quadrupeds, we shall find that, in some of them, the sartorius is situated on the aspect of the thigh which is turned to the side of the trunk. In the dog and the cat it arises from the anterior iliac spine, and from the half of the border of the bone situated immediately below it; but the fibres from this second origin being hidden by the tensor of the fascia lata, on the inner side of which they are situated, viewing the external surface of the thigh, the muscle seems to arise from the iliac spine only. The sartorius in these animals is divided into two parts, which, in general, are placed in contact. One of these fasciculi is anterior; the other is situated further back. The first is visible on the anterior border of the thigh, in front of the tensor of the fascia lata, but below it inclines inwards; in its superior part also, a small extent of the internal surface is occupied by it. The second, which, as we have said, is situated further back, belongs wholly to the inner surface of the thigh; it is this portion which arises from the inferior border of the ilium (this is the homologue of the anterior border of the human iliac bone). The two fasciculi then pass towards the knee, being in relation with the rectus and the vastus internus of the triceps. The anterior fasciculus is inserted into the patella. The posterior unites with the tendons of the gracilis (see below) and semi-tendinosus, and then proceeds to be inserted into the superior part of the internal surface of the tibia. On account of their different insertions these two parts receive the names of _the patellar sartorius_ and _tibial sartorius_ respectively. In the ox and the horse the sartorius is still more definitely situated on the internal surface of the thigh. Consisting of a single fasciculus, representing the tibial sartorius of the cat and the dog, it arises in the abdominal cavity from the fascia covering the iliac muscle, then passes under the crural arch, and terminates, by an aponeurosis which blends with that of the gracilis, on the inner fibres of the patellar ligament. In short, the sartorius is of interest to us in the carnivora only, and especially on account of its anterior or patellar fasciculus. It is an adductor of the leg and a flexor of the thigh. Muscles of the Internal Region The ilio-psoas pectineus and the adductors which we study in man, in connection with the internal aspect of the thigh, offer little of interest from the point of view of external form in quadrupeds; it is for this reason that we will disregard them. The gracilis alone merits description. =Gracilis= (Fig. 87, 9; Fig. 88, 6).--Designated in veterinary anatomy under the name of _the short adductor of the leg_, this muscle, expanded in width, occupies the greater part of the internal surface of the thigh, _or flat of the thigh_, as this region is also called. Let us imagine, in man, the internal surface of the thigh broader, and the internal rectus more expanded, and we shall have an idea of the same muscle as it exists in quadrupeds. The gracilis arises from the ischio-pubic symphysis and from the neighbouring regions; thence it is directed towards the leg to be inserted into the superior part of the internal surface of the tibia, after being united to the tendons of the sartorius and semi-tendinosus. We find, accordingly, at this level, an arrangement which recalls the general appearance of what in man receives the name of _the goose's foot_ (_pes anserinus_). It is between this muscle and the sartorius, at the superior part of the internal surface of the thigh, in the region which recalls the triangle of Scarpa, that we are able, especially in the cat and the dog, to see the adductor muscles of the thigh. We also partly see there, in these animals, the vastus internus and the rectus of the triceps (see Fig. 87). The gracilis is an adductor of the thigh. Muscles of the Leg We will divide the leg into three regions: anterior, external, and posterior. With regard to the internal region, there are no muscles which belong exclusively to it; for it is in great measure formed by the internal surface of the tibia, which, as in man, is subcutaneous. Muscles of the Anterior Region We first note that in the human species the tibialis anticus, extensor proprius pollicis, extensor longus digitorum and the peroneous tertius or anticus, form the subcutaneous layer of this region. We now proceed to study these muscles in quadrupeds. [Illustration: FIG. 83.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: THE ANTERIOR TIBIAL MUSCLE (FLEXOR OF THE METATARSUS), LEFT LEG, ANTERIOR VIEW. 1, Femoral trochlea; 2, tibia; 3, tendinous portion of the tibialis anticus; 4, cuboid branch of same; 5, 5, its metatarsal branch; 6, fleshy portion; 7, cuneiform branch of its tendon; 8, metatarsal branch of the same tendon; 9, extensor longus digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges turned outwards); 10, peroneus brevis (lateral extensor of the phalanges).] =Tibialis Anticus= (Fig. 83; Fig. 84, 6; Fig. 85, 4; Fig. 87, 10; Fig. 88, 10, 11).--It is further named by veterinarians the _flexor of the metatarsus_. In the dog and the cat this muscle, which is rather large, arises from the external tuberosity of the tibia and from the crest of this bone. In its superior part it is flat, but lower down it is thick and produces a prominence in front of the tibia. Finally, it becomes tendinous, and passes towards the tarsus; thence it is directed towards the inner side of the metatarsus, and is inserted into the great-toe, this latter being sometimes well developed, but also often merely represented by a small bony nodule on which the muscle is then fixed. In the other animals with which we here occupy ourselves, the tibialis anticus presents a complexity which would be incomprehensible unless this muscle be first studied in the horse. In this latter the tibialis anticus consists of two distinct portions, placed one in front of the other: a fleshy portion, and a tendinous portion running parallel to it. The muscle is covered, except on its internal part and inferiorly, by a muscle with which we will occupy ourselves later on--that is, the common extensor of the toes. The tendinous portion of the tibialis anticus (Fig. 83), especially covered by the extensor of the toes, arises from the inferior extremity of the femur, from the fossa situated between the trochlea and the external condyle; thence it descends towards a groove which is hollowed out on the external tuberosity of the tibia, and is directed towards the tarsus, where it divides into two branches, which are inserted into the cuboid bone and the superior extremity of the principal metatarsal. These two parts form a ring through which the terminal tendon of the fleshy portion of the same muscle passes. This fleshy portion, situated behind the preceding, arises from the superior extremity of the tibia, on the borders of the groove in which the tendinous portion lies; thence it passes downwards for a short distance on the inner side of the common extensor of the toes, which covers it in the rest of its extent. It ends in a tendon which, after passing through the tendinous ring above noticed, divides into two branches. One of these branches is inserted into the anterior surface of the superior extremity of the principal metatarsal, the other into the second cuneiform bone. [Illustration: FIG. 84.--MYOLOGY OF THE DOG: LEFT HIND-LIMB, EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Biceps cruris and fascia lata, divided in order to expose the upper part of the muscles of the leg; 2, inferior portion of the triceps cruris; 3, patella; 4, semi-tendinosus; 5, inferior extremity of the femur; 6, tibialis anticus (flexor of the metatarsus); 7, extensor longus digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges); 8, tibia; 9, peroneus longus; 10, peroneus brevis; 11, fifth metatarsal; 12, fasciculus detached from the peroneus brevis and passing towards the fifth toe; 13, external head of gastrocnemius; 14, tendo-Achillis; 15, calcaneum; 16, flexor digitorum sublimis; 17, 17, tendon of the flexor digitorum sublimis; 18, flexor longus pollicis (portion of the deep flexor of the toes); 19, dorsal muscle of the foot (short extensor of the toes).] In the ox the same two portions of the tibialis anticus exist, but with this capital difference--that the anterior portion is fleshy, superficial, and blended for a great part of its length with the common extensor of the toes. The portion which corresponds to that which is fleshy in the horse arises from the tibia; below, it ends on the inner surface of the superior extremity of the metatarsus and the cuneiform bones. That which represents the tendinous part, which is also fleshy, as we have just pointed out, arises above with the common extensor of the toes, from the femur, in the fossa situated between the trochlea and the external condyle; whilst below, after having given passage to the tendon of the preceding portion, as in the horse, it is inserted into the metatarsus and the cuneiform bones. In the pig, the tibialis anticus presents an arrangement nearly similar to that which we have just described. It seems to us of interest to add that it has been sought to ascertain to what muscle of the human leg the tendinous part of the tibialis of the horse corresponds--a part which has become fleshy in the pig and the ox. According to some authors, it represents the peroneus tertius; but that muscle is situated on the outer side of the common extensor of the toes; and here the portion with which it has been compared is placed on the inside. It has also been likened to a portion of the common extensor of the toes, but it does not pass to the latter. Lastly, it has been considered as being the homologue of the proper extensor of the great-toe; but why, then, in the ox, which has no great-toe, is it so highly developed? Nevertheless, its position and its relations sufficiently warrant this method of comprehending it. The tibialis anticus is a flexor of the foot. It is also able, in animals in which the tarsal articulations allow of the movement, to rotate the foot inwards. [Illustration: FIG. 85.--MYOLOGY OF THE OX: LEFT LEG, EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Gluteus maximus and biceps cruris; 2, semi-tendinosus; 3, patella; 4, tibialis anticus (flexor of the metatarsus); 5, extensor longus digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges); 6, fasciculus of the extensor longus digitorum, which is considered as the representative of the tendinous portion of the tibialis anticus in the horse; 7, peroneus longus; 8, peroneus brevis (proper extensor of the external toe); 9, external head of gastrocnemius; 10, soleus; 11, tendo-Achillis; 12, calcaneum; 13, tendon of the extensor longus digitorum (superficial flexor of the phalanges); 14, flexor longus pollicis and tibialis posticus (deep flexor of the phalanges); 15, tendon of the superficial flexor of the toes; 16, tendon of the deep flexor of the toes; 17, suspensory ligament of the fetlock.] With regard to the tendinous part, called by veterinarians the _cord of the flexor of the metatarsus_, it serves, in the horse, to produce the flexion of the metatarsus when the knee is already flexed; it thus acts in a passive fashion, which is explained by its resistance and the position which it occupies in relation to these two articulations. =Extensor Proprius Pollicis.=--This muscle exists only in the dog and the cat, and there in a rudimentary condition. It is covered by the common extensor of the toes and the tibialis anticus, and passes, accompanied by the tendon of this latter muscle, to terminate on the second metatarsal, or the phalanx, which articulates with it. When the first toe exists in the dog, it is inserted into this by a very slender tendon. =Extensor Longus Digitorum= (Fig. 83, 9; Fig. 84, 7; Fig. 85, 5, 6; Fig. 86, 4; Fig. 87, 12; Fig. 88, 7).--It is also called by veterinarians _the anterior extensor of the phalanges_. In the dog and the cat this muscle is to be seen in the space limited behind by the peroneus longus and in front by the tibialis anticus. Above it is covered by this latter. In the lower half of the leg, it is also in relation, on the inner side, with the tibialis anticus; but behind it is separated from the peroneus longus by the external surface of the shaft and inferior extremity of the tibia. This arrangement, besides, recalls that which is found in man, the peroneus longus of the latter diverging in the same way, at this level, from the common extensor, and leaving exposed the corresponding portion of the skeleton of the leg. This muscle, fusiform in shape, arises at its upper part from the external surface of the inferior extremity of the femur, then its tendon passes into a groove hollowed on the external tuberosity of the tibia. The fleshy body which succeeds is directed towards the tarsus, but before reaching it is replaced by a tendon. This tendon, at the level of the metatarsal bones, divides into four slips, which pass towards the toes, and are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the latter. In the horse it covers, to a great extent, the tibialis anticus, so that it is the latter which forms the large fusiform prominence especially noticeable in the middle region, to which the contour of the anterior surface of the leg is due. [Illustration: FIG. 86.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: LEFT HIND-LIMB, EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Semi-tendinosus; 2, biceps cruris; 3, patella; 4, extensor longus digitorum (anterior extensor of the phalanges); 5, reinforcing band arising from the ligament of the fetlock; 6, peroneus brevis (lateral extensor of the phalanges); 7, external head of gastrocnemius; 8, soleus; 9, tendo-Achillis; 10, calcaneum; 11, tendon of the superficial flexor of the toes (superficial flexor of the phalanges); 12, flexor longus pollicis and tibialis posticus (deep flexor of the phalanges); 13, 13, tendon of the superficial flexor of the phalanges; 14, 14, tendon of the deep flexor of the phalanges; 15, suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 16, principal metatarsal: 17, external rudimentary metatarsal.] It arises above from the inferior extremity of the femur, from the fossa situated between the trochlea and the external condyle; therefore, it has a common origin with the tendinous portion of the tibialis anticus, or flexor of the metatarsus. The tendon, which at the level of the inferior part of the leg succeeds to the fleshy body, passes in front of the tarsus, the principal metatarsal, and receives the tendon of the peroneus brevis which we will describe later on. It then reaches the anterior surface of the fetlock. There it presents an arrangement analogous to that which we have pointed out in connection with the anterior extensor of the phalanges--a muscle which, in the fore-limbs, corresponds to the common extensor of the digits; that is to say, it is inserted, in form of an expansion, into the pyramidal prominence of the third phalanx, after having formed attachments to the first and second, and having received on each side a strengthening band from the suspensory ligament of the fetlock. In the ox the long extensor of the toes is united above, and for a great part of its length, with the portion of the tibialis anticus, which represents, albeit in the fleshy state, the tendinous cord of the latter in the horse. In common with this portion, it arises from the inferior extremity of the femur. Thence it passes towards the tarsus and divides into two fasciculi, internal and external, which are continued by tendons. These pass towards the phalanges, and, in case of the common extensor of the digits belonging to the fore-limbs, the internal is destined for the internal toe, and the external is common to the two toes.

Apart from the fasciculi which correspond to the tendinous portion of the tibialis anticus (fleshy here, as in the ox), the long extensor of the toes at the level of the tarsus divides into three tendons: the internal goes to the great internal toe; the middle bifurcates in the upper part of the digital portion of the foot, and each of its branches goes towards one of the great-toes; the external divides to pass towards each of the two small toes, and towards the great ones; but this latter disposition is not constant. By its contraction the muscle which we have just studied extends the phalanges and flexes the foot. =Peroneus Tertius.=--This muscle is not found in domestic quadrupeds. We should remember, nevertheless, that certain authors consider as representing it the tendinous portion of the anterior tibial of the horse, or the corresponding portion now fleshy, of the same muscle in the pig and the ox. It is by reason of this fact that it is called the third peroneal, notwithstanding that in the numerical order of the peroneals it is rather the first. But that which still further complicates this question of nomenclature is that some authors give this name of third to a peroneal which, in the carnivora, is situated more definitely in the group of external muscles (see below, =Short Lateral Peroneal=). Muscles of the External Region In man, two muscles constitute this region; they are the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. =Peroneus Longus= (Fig. 84, 9; Fig. 85, 7).--This muscle does not exist in the domestic animals; only in the flesh-eaters, the pig and the ox excepted. It is in relation superiorly with the tibialis anticus, and inferiorly with the common extensor of the toes; in the ox, it is in contact with this latter muscle throughout its whole length. The peroneus longus arises from the external tuberosity of the tibia; towards the middle of the leg it is replaced by a tendon. This proceeds towards the tarsus, but previously it passes between the tibia and fibula. In the ox it is situated in front of the coronoid tarsal bone; we recollect that this bone is regarded as representing the inferior extremity of the fibula (see p. 97). Then it passes into a groove belonging to the cuboid bone or to the cuboido-scaphoid bone in the ox, traverses obliquely the posterior aspect of the tarsus, and is inserted into the rudimentary bone which represents the first toe; or, if this does not exist, into the innermost of the metatarsal bones. This muscle is an extensor of the foot. It also rotates it outwards in the animals in which the articulation permits this latter movement. =Peroneus Brevis= (Fig. 83, 8; Fig. 83, 10; Fig. 84, 10; Fig. 86, 6).--In the dog and the cat, this muscle is covered in part by the peroneus longus, and arises from the inferior half of the tibia and the fibula; at the level of the tarsus it becomes tendinous, passes into a groove hollowed out on the external surface of the inferior extremity of the fibula, and terminates on the external aspect of the superior extremity of the fifth metatarsal. A little before this insertion it crosses the tendon of the long peroneal in passing to the outer side of the latter. To the short peroneal muscle is found annexed a very thin fasciculus which lies upon it. This fasciculus arises from beneath the head of the fibula, and is soon replaced by a thin tendon, which, accompanying that of the short peroneal, proceeds towards the foot, after having traversed the groove in the inferior extremity of the fibula; passes along by the fifth metatarsal (Fig. 84, 12); blends at the level of the first phalanx of the fifth toe with the corresponding tendon of the long extensor of the toes, and partakes of the insertions of this tendon. This fasciculus is designated by some authors under the name of the peroneal of the fifth toe, or the proper extensor of the same toe. But what makes still further complications is that other authors regard it as an anterior, or third, peroneal. Now, these names are those which other anatomists have applied to the fasciculus of the anterior tibial, which, in the pig and the ox, is fused in part with the long extensor of the toes. Hence there results a confusion which is truly regrettable. In brief, we can, without inconvenience, consider it as a fasciculus of the short peroneal muscle. We sometimes find in man, but abnormally, an arrangement which partly recalls that which we have just indicated. It consists in a duplication of the tendon of the short peroneal, one of the branches of which goes to the fifth metatarsal, and the other to the fifth toe; it is sometimes a single fasciculus which goes to the phalanges of this latter. We have met with examples of these anomalies.[31] In the pig, the short peroneal is situated on the same plane as the long. It consists of two clearly distinct fasciculi, which arise from the fibula. The tendon of the anterior fasciculus proceeds to the great external toe--that is to say, the fourth, of which it is the proper extensor. The posterior fasciculus terminates on the small external toe, the fifth, of which it is in like manner the extensor. [31] Ãdouard Cuyer, 'Anomalies, Osseous and Muscular' (_Bulletins de la SociÃ©tÃ© d'Anthropologie_, Paris, 1891). In the ox, the fleshy fibres of the short peroneal arise from a fibrous band which replaces the fibula, and from the external tuberosity of the tibia. Situated behind the long peroneal and on the same plane, it terminates in a tendon which appears at the level of the inferior part of the leg; it passes in front of the canon, and is inserted into the external toe, of which it is the proper extensor. In the horse, it is the sole representative of the peroneal muscles, and veterinary anatomists have given it the name of _the lateral extensor of the phalanges_. Its fleshy body arises above from the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint, and from the whole length of the fibula. In the middle third of the leg it is narrowed; lower down it is replaced by a tendon. This is lodged in a groove hollowed on the external surface of the inferior extremity of the tibia; then after passing along the external surface of the tarsus, it is directed forward, and proceeds to blend towards the middle of the canon-bone with the tendon of the long extensor of the toes, or anterior extensor of the phalanges, of which it shares the insertions. It extends the phalanges into which it is inserted. It also flexes the foot. Muscles of the Posterior Region It will not be unprofitable to recall to mind that, in man, the muscles of this region are arranged in two layers: a superficial layer consisting of the gastrocnemius and soleus, to which is added a muscle of little importance, the plantaris, and a deep layer formed by four muscles--the popliteus, flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, and flexor longus pollicis. The gastrocnemius and soleus, independent in their upper portion, unite below in a common tendon; they thus form also a triceps muscle, which we designate under the name of the triceps of the leg, or triceps suralis, because it forms the elevation of the calf of the leg (from _sura_, calf). =Gastrocnemius= (Fig. 83, 9, 11; Fig. 84, 13, 14; Fig. 86, 7, 9; Fig. 88, 13).--The external and internal heads of the gastrocnemius, distinct from one another only in their upper portion, arise from the shaft of the femur, above the condyles, on the borders of the popliteal surface, to a relatively considerable extent in the great quadrupeds. At this level they are situated in the popliteal region--that is to say, in the space limited externally by the biceps, and internally by the semi-tendinosus. But as they descend to a rather low level on the leg in quadrupeds, and especially in carnivora, they do not, properly speaking, determine a projection of the calf of the leg. However, they pass from this region but to be soon continued by a tendon--the tendo-Achillis, which is inserted into the calcaneum. Now, the region of the tarsus is called by veterinarians _the ham_, the posterior surface of which is angular, because of the oblique direction of the leg with regard to the vertical direction of the metatarsus and the presence of the calcaneum; the prominence which this surface presents has received the name of _the point of the ham_, and the tendon which ends there that of _the cord of the ham_. But the tendo-Achillis does not alone form this cord. Indeed, as we will soon see, the tendon of the superficial flexor of the toes takes part in its formation. We may add, with regard to the tendo-Achillis, that it is more clearly perceived as an external feature, because the skin sinks in front of it, as it does in man, over the lateral parts of the region which it occupies. The gastrocnemius, when it contracts, extends the foot on the leg. It serves to maintain the tibio-tarsal angle in the standing position, and during walking, to determine the steadying of the hind-limbs, which then, after the fashion of a spring, project the body forward. By an analogous movement they take part in the posterior projection of the hind-limbs in the act of kicking; but they are not the only ones to act in this case, the muscles of the buttock and thigh also being brought into play. =Soleus= (Fig. 83, 10; Fig. 86, 8).--This muscle, much less developed in quadrupeds than in man, does not exist in the dog. With regard to the soleus in the pig, Professor Lesbre says: 'Meckel denied its existence; we, however, believe that it is united to the external head of the gastrocnemius, its origin being transferred to the femur.'[32] [32] F. X. Lesbre, 'Essai de Myologie comparÃ©e de l'homme et des mammifÃ¨res domestiques en vue d'Ã©tablir une nomenclature unique et rationelle,' Lyon, 1897, p. 169. But in animals in which it exists, this muscle, of but little importance, occupies the outer side of the leg. It arises above from the external tuberosity of the tibia, and terminates below in a tendon which is united with that of the gastrocnemius. The soleus has the same action as these latter. =Plantaris.=--In quadrupeds this muscle is blended with the superficial flexor of the toes, which we will study afterwards. =Popliteus= (Fig. 87, 16; Fig. 88, 14).--In man, this muscle, which occupies the posterior surface of the tibia, above the oblique line, is completely covered by the gastrocnemius. In quadrupeds, where it is more voluminous, it projects internally beyond the gastrocnemius, so that it is seen in the internal and superior part of the region of the superficial layer of muscles, immediately behind the internal surface of the tibia, which, as we know, is subcutaneous. The popliteus arises from the external surface of the external condyle of the femur. Thence its fibres which diverge pass to be inserted into the superior part of the posterior surface and of the internal border of the tibia. It is in this latter region that it projects beyond the gastrocnemius, but we may add that there it is more or less covered by the semi-tendinosus. It flexes the leg, and rotates it forwards. =Superficial Flexor of the Toes= (Fig. 83, 13, 15; Fig. 84, 17; Fig. 86, 11, 13, 13; Fig. 87, 17; Fig. 88, 15, 18, 18).--In man, the homologue of this muscle is found in the sole of the foot. It is called _the short flexor of the toes_. It arises from the calcaneum, and passes to the four outer toes. In quadrupeds, it rises as high as the back of the knee, and is found blended with the plantaris. Further designated by the name of _the superficial flexor of the phalanges_, covered in part by the gastrocnemius, with which it is in relation for a great part of the course which it traverses, this muscle arises from the posterior surface of the femur, on the external branch of the inferior bifurcation of the linea aspera. In the horse, this origin takes place in a depression situated above the external condyle, in the supracondyloid fossa. Then it accompanies the gastrocnemius, and becomes tendinous where the tendo-Achillis commences. It then winds round the latter in placing itself on its inner side, then on its posterior surface, and reaches the calcaneum. It accordingly contributes, as we have already pointed out, to form the cord of the ham. After having become expanded, and having covered as with a sort of fibrous cap the bone of the heel, it descends behind the metatarsus, and presents there an arrangement analogous to that which we pointed out in connection with the superficial flexor of the digits--that is, it contributes to form the _tendon_. This prominence, in the form of a cord, we see behind the canon-bone in solipeds and ruminants. It finally terminates in the same way as the muscle with which we have compared it (see p. 197). In the horse, its fleshy body is but slightly developed, so that its tendon alone is specially visible in the superficial muscular layer, but in the dog and the cat it is large. Hence it results that its fleshy body appears on each side of the inferior half of the gastrocnemius, and produces an elevation which recalls that which the soleus produces on each side of the same muscles in the human species. The muscles which follow form, with the popliteus, which we have already studied, the deep layer of the posterior region of the leg. =Flexor Longus Digitorum= (Fig. 87, 19; Fig. 88, 17).--This muscle, in man, is the only common flexor of the toes belonging to the muscles of the leg. In comparison with the preceding muscle, it is a deep flexor. Veterinarians have given it the name of _the oblique flexor of the phalanges_. Visible on the internal aspect of the superficial layer of the muscles of the leg, this muscle arises above from the posterior surface of the external tuberosity of the tibia, becomes tendinous, passes towards the metatarsus, and blends with the tendons of the posterior tibial and the long proper flexor of the great-toe. In the dog and the cat it is blended with this latter only. =Tibialis Posticus= (Fig. 85, 14; Fig. 86, 12; Fig. 87, 20; Fig. 88, 16).--This muscle arises from the external tuberosity of the tibia, and from the head of the fibula. Thence it passes to the tarsus, and terminates in different fashion in carnivora and other quadrupeds. In the dog and the cat, it is inserted into the ligamentous apparatus of the tarsus, or into the base of the second metatarsal. In the other quadrupeds with which we are here occupied it is blended with the long proper flexor of the great-toe. It is accordingly in the carnivora that the mode of termination of the tibialis posticus most nearly resembles that of this same muscle in the human species. From this independence there results a special action. It is an adductor and internal rotator of the foot. =Flexor Longus Pollicis= (Fig. 84, 18; Fig. 85, 14; Fig. 86, 12; Fig. 87, 18; Fig. 88, 16).--This muscle, as that in man, is the most external of the deep layer of the leg. It is on the external aspect of the latter we perceive it, between the peroneals and the gastrocnemius or tendo-Achillis. It arises from the fibula and tibia, and is thence directed towards the tarsus. It unites with the long common flexor of the toes to form with it _the deep flexor of the phalanges_, of which it is the principal fasciculus. We may add that in the dog and the cat the posterior tibial remains independent of this latter, but that in the pig, ox, and horse the posterior tibial is united to the preceding to form with them the deep flexor muscle. Thus constituted, the deep flexor goes towards the phalanges, where it terminates as the deep flexor of the digits of the fore-limbs (see p. 197). In animals possessed of a canon it contributes to form the _tendon_ (Fig. 85, 16; Fig. 86, 14, 14; Fig. 88, 19, 19). Muscles of the Foot We must remember that on the dorsal surface of the foot in man we find but a single muscle--the dorsalis pedis. The remaining subcutaneous structures of this region consist of the tendons of the anterior muscles of the leg which occupy this dorsal aspect. =Dorsalis Pedis= (Fig. 84, 19).--Also called the extensor brevis digitorum, the dorsalis pedis muscle is found in all domestic quadrupeds; but its development is so much the less as the number of digits is more reduced. In the dog and the cat it arises from the calcaneum, and is inserted into the three internal toes (the first toe excepted) by uniting with the corresponding tendons of the common extensor. In the pig its disposition is analogous. As for the dorsalis pedis of the ox and the horse, it is extremely rudimentary, and occupies the superior part of the canon. It is a small, fleshy body, situated on the anterior surface of the metatarsus, which arises from the calcaneum, whence it passes to unite at its inferior extremity with the tendon of the extensor of the phalanges. As regards the muscles of the sole of the foot, we think it unnecessary to occupy ourselves at any length with them because of their slight importance with regard to external form. We will only recall that in the median portion of this plantar surface we find in man the short flexor of the toes, which in quadrupeds arises higher up, from the posterior surface of the femur; that it belongs to the muscles of the leg; and that it forms the superficial flexor of the toes, which we have already studied. We may further add that the suspensory ligament of the fetlock in ruminants and solipeds represents, as in the fore-limbs, the interosseous muscles. MUSCLES OF THE HEAD We will divide these muscles into two categories: masticatory and cutaneous. Masticatory Muscles The muscles of this group which specially interest us are the masseter and the temporal. As regards the pterygoids, since they are situated within the borders of the inferior maxillary bone, and consequently do not reach the surface, we shall not require to occupy ourselves with them here. =Masseter= (Fig. 89, 2; Fig. 90, 1; Figs. 91, 92).--For those who have studied the masseter of man, it is not difficult to recognise that of quadrupeds. Nevertheless, the particular aspect which it presents in different species gives to its study a certain interest. Arising from the zygomatic arch, and passing downwards and backwards, it is inserted into the external surface of the ramus of the mandible and into its angle. Its posterior border is in relation with the parotid gland (Fig. 90, 14; Figs. 91, 92), this gland being situated between the corresponding border of the lower jaw bone and the transverse process of the atlas. Such are the general characters; the following are the particular ones: In the carnivora it is thick and convex. In the horse it is flat, but more expanded; it forms the _flat of the cheek_. In the ox it is flat, as in the latter; but, while being less thick, it is more prolonged in the vertical direction. The form of the osseous parts which give it origin is, besides, in relation with these differences, and explains the peculiar characters which the masseter presents. [Illustration: FIG. 89.--MYOLOGY OF THE DOG: MASTICATORY MUSCLES (A DEEPER DISSECTION THAN THAT SHOWN IN FIG. 90). 1, Zygomatic arch; 2, masseter; 3, temporal exposed by the suppression of the auricular and occipital muscles and the pinna of the ear; 4, auditory canal; 5, inferior maxillary bone; 6, digastric.] Indeed, in the dog and the cat the zygomatic arch, strongly convex, springs up in a marked manner from the plane of the lateral aspects of the skull. In the horse the same arch, less prominent externally, is prolonged by a rectilinear crest on the superior maxillary bone, where it is continued in forming the zygomatic or maxillary spine. In the ox the same crest ascends a good way towards the inferior margin of the orbit in a curved direction with the concavity inferior, to redescend afterwards on the external surface of the superior maxilla. The masseter is an elevator of the lower jaw. It acts, above all, as in the human species, in the process of mastication. =Temporal Muscle= (Fig. 89, 3).--The development of the temporal is in proportion to the energy of the movements of elevation which the lower jaw has to execute. It arises from the temporal fossa, and is inserted into the coronoid process of the inferior maxilla. Its development, enormous in the carnivora, is such that the muscle projects beyond its fossa. It is less voluminous in the horse, and still less so in the ox. In the latter, indeed, the temporal fossa, although deep, is of small extent (see Fig. 62, p. 119); the frontal bone being large, it is found to be thrown back on the lateral walls of the cranium, below the osseous processes which support the horns and overhang the fossa in question, as well as the muscle which it contains. It is covered by the auricular muscles, and by the base of the pinna of the ear. Like the masseter, the temporal is an elevator of the lower jaw. Cutaneous Muscles of the Head =Occipito-Frontalis.=--The epicranial aponeurosis is extremely thin. In the dog the occipital muscle occupies the superior part of the head; it overlies the temporal muscle. With regard to the frontal muscle, which is of great extent in the ox (Fig. 91, F), it is represented in the horse and the carnivora by a small fleshy fasciculus only, the _fronto-palpebral muscle_, similar to the superciliary muscle. This, occupying the superior and internal part of the border of the orbit, ends by blending its fibres with those of the orbicular muscle of the eyelids at the region of the eyebrow. =Orbicularis Palpebrarum= (Fig. 90, 2; Figs. 91, 92).--This annular muscle surrounds the palpebral orifice, and takes its origin on the internal part of the orbital region. In the horse it arises, by a small tendon, from a tubercle which occupies the external surface of the os unguis, or lachrymal bone. This muscle determines the narrowing and closure of the palpebral orifice. =Pyramidalis Nasi.=--The pyramidal muscle is not found in the domestic animals. It appears to be blended with the internal elevator of the upper lip and wing of the nose; this is easy of comprehension if we bear in mind the relative position of these two muscles in the human species. [Illustration: FIG. 90.--MYOLOGY OF THE DOG: MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. 1, Masseter; 2, orbicularis palpebrarum; 3, zygomaticus major; 4, lachrymal (this muscle is sometimes described under the name of the small zygomatic); 5, levator labii superioris proprius; 6, levator labii superioris alÃ¦que nasi; 7, caninus; 9, buccinator; 11, zygomatico-auricularis; 12, external temporo-auricularis; 14, parotid gland; 15, parotido-auricularis; 16, inferior maxillary bone; 17, digastric.] =Corrugator Supercilii.=--This muscle is represented by the fronto-palpebral muscle noticed above, which is by some regarded as a vestige of the frontal. =Zygomaticus Major= (Fig. 90, 3; Figs. 91, 92).--This is the _zygomatic-labial_ of veterinarians. This muscle is of an elongated form, and has a ribbon-like aspect. In the dog and the cat it arises from the base of the pinna of the ear, from the portion of this base which bears the name of scutiform cartilage. (With regard to this cartilage, see p. 242, =Zygomatico-auricularis=.) From this it is directed downwards and forwards, to terminate, after having crossed the masseter, on the deep surface of the skin of the corresponding labial commissure. This mode of termination is the same in the ox and the horse; but where the muscle differs is at the level of its upper extremity. There it ascends less than in the carnivora. In the ox it arises from the zygomatic arch in the neighbourhood of the temporo-maxillary articulation; in the pig and the horse its origin is still lower, on the surface of the masseter, close to the maxillary spine. When it contracts, it draws upwards the labial commissure. Now, in man, we remember, it is the great zygomatic that, by an action of the same kind, determines the essential characters of the expression of laughing. There is, accordingly, a connection to be established between those displacements which are similar and the analogy of facial expression which necessarily results from them.[33] [33] Ãdouard Cuyer, 'The Mimic,' Paris, 1802. =Zygomaticus Minor= (Fig. 90, 4; Figs. 91, 92).--The existence of this muscle has not been clearly demonstrated. Nevertheless, Straus-Durckheim noted its presence in the horse, and described it as 'a muscle arising by two heads, of which one, the superior, arises from the malar bone below the orbit, and passes downwards and forwards over the fibro-adipose layer which supports the moustache. The second, the inferior, arises from the alveolar border in front of the second molar tooth, and passes forward to be inserted into the same fibro-adipose layer.'[34] [34] H. Straus-Durckheim, 'Anatomie descriptive et comparative du chat,' Paris, 1845, t. ii., p. 210. In connection with other quadrupeds, it is described by certain authors as a very thin muscle, arising below the cavity of the orbit, where it is blended with the fibres of the internal elevator of the upper lip and the ala of the nose; thence it proceeds to terminate below by uniting with the subcutaneous muscle. But this muscle is regarded by other authors as the lachrymal muscle, which does not exist in this state in man, but of which the development is particularly remarkable, as to extent, in the ox, in which it descends as far as the buccinator. According to other authors, some of the fibres of this muscle constitute the small zygomatic. [Illustration: FIG. 91.--MYOLOGY OF THE OX: MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. 1, Masseter; 2, orbicularis palpebrarum; F, frontalis; 3, zygomaticus major; 4, lachrymal (this muscle is sometimes described under the name of small zygomatic); 5, levator labii superioris proprius; 6, levator labii superioris alÃ¦que nasi; 7, levator anguli oris or caninus; 8, orbicularis oris; 9, buccinator; 10, maxillo-labial; 11, zygomatico-auricularis; 12, external temporo-auricularis; 14, parotid gland; 15, parotido-auricularis; 16, inferior maxillary bone.] =Levator Labii Superioris Proprius= (Fig. 90, 5; Figs. 91, 92).--Also named by veterinarians the _supramaxillo-labial_, or again, the _proper elevator of the upper lip_, this muscle arises from the external surface of the superior maxillary bone, passes under the superficial elevator, which we shall study in the succeeding paragraph, and goes to be inserted into the thickness of the lip, to which its name indicates that it belongs. The peculiarities of this muscle in different animals are the following: In the dog and the cat it arises behind the infra-orbital foramen. In the pig it arises from a depression below the orbital cavity, and its fleshy body is terminated in front by a strong tendon in the upper part of the snout, in which it divides into fasciculi. In the ox it arises from the maxillary spine. In the horse it arises below the orbital cavity; then, after having crossed the superficial elevator, it ends in a tendinous expansion, situated in the median line between the nasal fossÃ¦. This expansion divides into fasciculi, which end in the thickness of the upper lip. By the contraction of this muscle, the lip is raised, on one side only, if a single muscle contracts, or in its whole extent, if the two muscles act simultaneously. =Internal Elevator (or Superficial) of the Upper Lip and the Wing of the Nose= (_levator labii superioris alÃ¦que nasi_) (Fig. 90, 6; Figs. 91, 92).--This is the muscle veterinarians designate _the supranaso-labial_. Arising from the frontal and nasal bones, it thence passes towards the upper lip, where it is inserted as well as into the wing of the nose. In the ox it is united above with the frontal muscle, and below is divided into two fasciculi, between which pass the elevator described above and the canine muscle. In the horse it is also divided into two fasciculi; but the arrangement is the opposite as regards, their relations with neighbouring muscles, in this animal and in the preceding. In the ox the external fasciculus is covered by the external elevator and the canine, which pass under the internal fasciculus; in the horse the deep elevator passes under the two fasciculi, and the canine passes under the external bundle, and afterwards covers the internal. In the pig, the internal elevator is wanting. As its name indicates, it raises the upper lip and the wing of the nose. =Transversus Nasi.=--In the horse this muscle, which is very thin, is situated on the dorsum of the nose, and proceeds to be inserted into the cartilaginous skeleton of the nostrils. In the pig, it occupies an analogous situation. It does not exist in the ox or in carnivora. The transversus nasi is a dilator of the nostrils. [Illustration: FIG. 92.--MYOLOGY OF THE HORSE: MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. 1, Masseter; 2, orbicularis palpebrarum; 3, zygomaticus major; 4, lachrymal (this muscle is sometimes described under the name of the small zygomatic); 5, external elevator (or deep) of the upper lip and ala of the nose; 6, internal elevator (or superficial) of the upper lip and of the ala of the nose; 7, levator anguli oris or caninus; 8, orbicularis oris; 9, buccinator; 10, maxillo-labialis; 11, zygomatico-auricularis; 12, temporo-auricularis externus; 13, cervico-auricularis; 14, parotid gland; 15, parotido-auricularis; 16, inferior maxillary bone.] =Caninus= (Fig. 90; Figs. 7, 91, 92).--This is the muscle called by veterinarians _the great supramaxillo-nasal_. In the dog and the cat it is situated below the inferior border of the external elevator of the upper lip, of which it follows the direction. It arises, as does this latter, from the external surface of the maxilla, and goes also to terminate in the upper lip by blending with the internal elevator of this lip and of the alÃ¦ of the nose. It raises the upper lip. In the ox, it arises from the maxillary spine, and then divides into three parts; the superior passes under the internal portion of the internal elevator of the upper lip and the alÃ¦ of the nose, and goes into the nostril; whilst the two others, situated lower down, terminate in the upper lip. In the pig, it is formed of two superimposed fasciculi, which arise from the spine of the maxilla and the impressions in front of it. These two fasciculi terminate in the snout, which they move laterally. In the horse, it is situated at a certain distance from the external elevator; in the preceding animals it is in contact with the latter. Arising behind from the external surface of the maxilla, in front of the maxillary spine, it is directed towards the anterior part of the face, passes under the external portion of the internal elevator (it is the opposite of this in the ox), and proceeds, on expanding, to terminate in the skin of the nostril. By its contraction it dilates the latter. =Orbicularis Oris= (Fig. 91, 8; Fig. 92).--This muscle, very fleshy in the solipeds and the ruminants, is arranged as a ring round the buccal orifice, in the thickness of the lips, where it is blended with the other muscles of this region. Having for its function the narrowing of the orifice it surrounds, it acts during suction and in the prehension of food. =Triangularis Oris.=--This muscle does not exist in domestic quadrupeds. =Quadratus Menti.=--In the pig and the carnivora, it arises from the anterior part of the body of the inferior maxillary bone, and passes at the other end to terminate in the corresponding portion of the lower lip, which it depresses by its contraction. In the ox and the horse this muscle does not exist; it is replaced for the depression of the lower lip, which it affects in other animals, by supplemental fibres of the buccinator. =The Prominence of the Chin.=--Below the lower lip in the horse is situated the so-called _prominence of the chin_, limited posteriorly by the _beard_, a depressed region which gives point to the curb of the bridle. The prominence, which also exists in the ox, is a fibro-muscular pad which blends with the orbicular muscle of the lips, and receives on its superior aspect the insertion of the two muscles (_levator menti_) by which it is suspended. These arise, above, on each side of the symphysis of the inferior maxillary bone. They raise the lower lip with force, and they are the agents which, as we can sometimes observe in the horse, make it click against the upper lip, suddenly projecting it upwards. This action sometimes becomes a habit, and its continuance constitutes a vice. A corresponding structure is found in the pig and in the carnivora, but in them it does not produce an external prominence such as we have described. =Buccinator= (Fig. 90, 9; Figs. 91, 92).--Further designated by the name of _alveolo-labial_, this muscle is situated on the lateral portions of the face, in the thickness of the cheeks. It consists of two layers, one superficial and the other deep. The deep portion arises from the portion of the alveolar border of the superior maxillary bone which corresponds to the molar teeth, and from the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible. Thence it is directed forwards, passes under the superficial layer, and blends with the fibres of the orbicular muscle of the lips. To this part of the buccinator some authors give the name of molar muscle. The superficial portion is formed by fibres which pass from the alveolar border of the superior maxillary bone to the corresponding border of the opposite bone. It is very highly developed in the herbivora. This muscle acts especially during mastication; it serves to press back again under the molar teeth the portions of food which fall outside the dental arch. In the pig, the ox, and the horse, a muscle which is considered as supplemental to the buccinator is placed along the inferior border of the latter. This muscle, which we describe separately under the names of _maxillo-labialis_ (Fig. 91, 10; Fig. 92) and _depressor of the lower lip_, is clearly distinct from the buccinator, especially in the horse. It arises, behind, with the deep layer of the muscle to which it is annexed, from the anterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw; in front it terminates in the thickness of the lower lip. In the ox, it is more intimately united with the buccinator. It depresses the lip to which it is attached, and displaces it laterally when it acts on one side only. In the human species, the pinna of the ear being generally immobile, the muscles which belong to it are, very naturally, considerably atrophied. Accordingly, the auricular muscles, anterior, superior, and posterior, are reduced to pale and thin fleshy lamellÃ¦, whose action is revealed in certain individuals, only in a way which may be said to be abnormal. It is not the same in quadrupeds. The pinna of the ear is extremely mobile, and its displacements have a real value from the point of view of physiognomical expression. It is therefore necessary to review the muscles which move this pinna without giving them, at the same time, more importance than they merit, since in themselves they do not determine the formation of surface reliefs, which are sufficiently apparent. Notwithstanding that for certain of these muscles it is possible to trace their analogy with those of the auricular region of man, it is very difficult, because of their complexity, to trace this analogy for all. This is why we shall not be able here, as we have done for the other muscles of the subcutaneous layer, to give at the head of each paragraph the name of a human muscle, and then to group in the same paragraph the muscles which correspond to it in different quadrupeds. Therefore the nomenclature and the divisions adopted for these latter must serve us as a base or starting-point. Because the pinna of the horse's ear is so very mobile, we will first begin with a study of its auricular muscles. =Zygomatico-auricularis= (Fig. 92, 11).--This muscle, which is formed of two small bands of fleshy fibres, arises from the zygomatic arch in blending with the orbicular muscle of the eyelids; thence it is directed towards the base of the pinna of the ear, and is inserted into this base, and also into the cartilaginous plate situated in front of and internal to this, and resting on the surface of the temporal muscle; this is the scutiform cartilage. The zygomatico-auricularis, which we look on as the homologue of the anterior auricular of man, draws the pinna of the ear forwards. =Temporo-auricularis Externus= (Fig. 92, 12).--This, which is thin and very broad, covers the temporal muscle. It arises from the whole extent of the parietal crest, blending in this plane, in its posterior half, with the muscle of the opposite side. Thence it is directed outwards towards the pinna of the ear, and is inserted into the internal border of the scutiform cartilage and on the inner side of the concha--that is to say, of the conchinian cartilage--which forms the principal part of the pinna. We are supposing, in the description of the muscles which move it, that this pinna has its opening directed outwards. The external temporo-auricular, which recalls, from its situation, the superior auricular of man, is an adductor of the ear; besides, it causes it to describe a movement of rotation from without inwards, so as to direct its opening forwards. =Scuto-auricularis Externus.=--This muscle may be considered as supplementary to the external temporo-auricular; the concha fasciculus of this latter partly covers it. Extending from the scutiform cartilage to the inner side of the concha, it contributes to the movement of rotation by which the opening of the pinna of the ear is directed forwards. =Cervico-auricular Muscles= (Fig. 92, 13).--These muscles, three in number, are situated behind the pinna of the ear; they are called, from their mode of superposition, the superficial, middle, and deep. These arise, all three, from the superior cervical ligament, and pass from there towards the cartilage of the concha. They recall, as regards situation, the posterior auricular muscle of man. =Superficial Cervico-auricular= (_Cervico-auricularis superioris_).--This muscle, inserted into the posterior surface of the concha, draws this cartilage backwards and downwards. =Middle Cervico-auricular= (_Cervico-auricularis medius_).--Situated between the two other muscles of the same group, it proceeds, after having covered the superior extremity of the parotid gland, to be inserted into the external part of the base of the concha. It determines the rotation of this concha in such a way as to direct the opening of the ear backwards. =Deep Cervico-auricular= (_Cervico-auricularis inferioris_).--Covered by the preceding muscle and the superior portion of the parotid, it is inserted into the base of the pinna of the ear, and has the same action as the middle cervico-auricular. =Parotido-auricularis= (Fig. 92, 15).--This is a long and thin fleshy band which arises from the external surface of the parotid gland, and tapering as it passes upwards towards the pinna of the ear, is inserted into the external surface of the base of the concha, below the inferior part of the angle of reunion of the two borders which limit its opening. It inclines the pinna outwards; it is, accordingly, an abductor of the pinna. =Temporo-auricularis Internus.=--This muscle is covered by the external temporo-auricular and the superior cervico-auricular. It arises from the parietal crest, and is inserted into the internal surface of the concha. It is an adductor of the pinna of the ear. There are, finally, an internal scuto-auricular muscle and a tympano-auricular; but they do not present any interest for us; we can simply confine ourselves to making mention of them. In the ox, because of the situation of the temporal fossa and the fact that the external temporo-auricular muscle is applied, as in the horse, over the muscle which this fossa contains, this temporo-auricular muscle does not reach the middle line (Fig. 91, 12). But in the cat and the dog this muscle covers all the upper part of the head (Fig. 90, 12). It is divided into two parts: the interscutellar and the fronto-scutellar. The interscutellar is a single muscle, thin and broad, covering the temporal muscle and a portion of the occipital, extending from the scutiform cartilage of the pinna of one side to the same cartilage of the pinna belonging to the side opposite. It approximates the two pinnÃ¦ to one another by bringing them each into the position of adduction. The fronto-scutellar arises from the orbital process of the frontal bone, and from the orbital ligament, which at this level completes the interrupted osseous boundary of the orbital cavity. Thence it is directed, widening as it proceeds, towards the scutiform cartilage, and is there inserted by blending with the corresponding part of the great zygomatic. Its action is analogous to that of the preceding muscle; but, further, it directs the opening of the pinna forwards. These are the muscles which act, for example, when the dog, having his attention strongly attracted by any cause, pricks up his ears and turns the openings forward, in order the better to understand every sound which proceeds, or may possibly proceed, from that which he observes. From this, which may be extremely well seen in some individuals, results the appearance of vertical wrinkles of the skin in the interval between the pinnÃ¦ of the ears, these being caused by the folding of the integument, whilst the pinnÃ¦ approach one another. These movements, with which are associated fixation of look and a widening of the palpebral fissure, produce a peculiarly expressive look; this is why they merit our attention. =Zygomatico-auricularis= (Fig. 90, 11).--Arises from the internal surface of the great zygomatic, passes towards the pinna of the ear, and goes to be inserted into the external part of the base of the pinna, below its opening, to a prominence which corresponds to the antitragus of the human ear. It is to this antitragus, but proceeding from another direction, that the parotido-auricular muscle is inserted (Fig. 90, 15). With regard to the cervico-auriculars, they are all three present. The superior, or superficial, situated behind the interscutellar portion of the external temporo-auricular, has its origin on the median line of the neck; thence it passes towards the pinna of the ear, blending its fibres with those of the interscutellar muscle, and is inserted into the scutiform cartilage and the internal surface of the pinna. Such are the principal muscles of the ear in the carnivora; it would seem to us superfluous to dwell on the others of this region, so that we will here conclude the study of the muscles in general, and that of the myology of the head in particular. CHAPTER III EPIDERMIC PRODUCTS OF THE TERMINAL EXTREMITIES OF THE FORE AND HIND LIMBS We will first recall to mind that among the quadrupeds some are found of which the fingers and toes have their third phalanges terminated by claws--these are the unguiculates; and that in others the terminal extremity of each limb is completely encased in a horny envelope, the hoof--these are the ungulates. In the first group, the claws remind us to a certain extent of the arrangement of the nails in man; the inferior aspect of the paws is covered by an epidermic layer, thick and protective, which may be likened to the skin, correspondingly thick, which covers in the greater part of its extent the plantar surface of the foot in the human species. In the second group, the surface by which the third phalanx rests on the ground is correspondingly protected, but this time by a layer of horn which belongs to the hoof. After the preceding remarks, our study will be found to fall into a natural division, and it is in the order which we have just followed for the purpose of indicating its existence that we now proceed to study the nature and form of the different elements which complete or protect the digital extremities of the thoracic and abdominal limbs. =Claws.=--These horny coverings of the third phalanges, which we have to consider only in the dog and cat, may be compared with the nails of man, with which, however, they present, as is well understood, characteristic differences. The claws are compressed laterally, curved on themselves, and are terminated in front by a sharp point in the felide, but more blunted in the dog. Their superior border is convex and thick. We may say, therefore, that a claw is a sort of hollow tube, in the form of a cone flattened in the transverse direction, in which the third phalanx is set, and which is itself set in a groove formed by a kind of osseous hood which occupies the base of this third phalanx (see Fig. 37, p. 57). This definition is exact, as regards the general appearance; but, when more closely scrutinized, it is not sufficient. The tube in question is not formed of a single piece; each of the claws is formed by a lamina laterally folded, but of which the borders are not exactly joined together inferiorly; they leave between them a small interval, and this is filled by a layer of more friable horny substance, to which has been given the name of plantar nail. This arrangement, which is clearly defined in the dog (Fig. 93), is comparable to that which we shall afterwards meet with in connection with the sole of the hoof of the horse (see Fig. 100, p. 257). In the dog and the cat, the weight of the limb resting on the inferior surface of the phalanges, it was necessary that the region of the plantar surface of the foot corresponding to these latter should be protected; this is the function of certain fibro-adipose pads, which are situated there, and which are designated by the name of _plantar tubercles_. =Plantar Tubercles= (Fig. 94).--These tubercles, or dermic cushions, are divided, in each paw, into _tubercles of the digits_ (or of the toes), a _plantar tubercle_, and, on the fore-limbs, a _tubercle of the carpus_. The tubercles of the fingers (or of the toes) are of the same number as the latter. That which belongs to the thumb is but little developed, but the others are more so. They are in relation with the plantar surfaces of the second and third phalanges, so that when the paw is in contact with the ground the articulation which, in each of the fingers or toes, joins these phalanges, rests on the corresponding pad. The plantar tubercle is larger than the preceding. It is of a more or less rounded form; sometimes it is triangular, and then comparable in outline to the ace of hearts, the point of which is, in this case, turned towards the claws; its margin being sometimes strongly indented, it may also have a trilobate form. It is on it that rest the metacarpo-phalangeal or metatarso-phalangeal articulations, according to the limb studied. The tubercle of the carpus, situated at the level of the posterior surface of this latter, is less important than the preceding, the region which it occupies not reaching the ground during walking. But it is not to be neglected from the point of view of external form, because of the prominence which it produces. [Illustration: FIG. 93.--CLAW OF THE DOG: INFERIOR SURFACE. 1, Horny lamina of the claw; 2, plantar nail; 3, tubercle of the corresponding digit.] [Illustration: FIG. 94.--LEFT HAND OF THE DOG: INFERIOR SURFACE, PLANTAR TUBERCLES. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, Tubercles of the fingers; 2, plantar tubercle; 3, tubercle of the carpus.] In the ungulates the terminal extremity of the limb is, as we have above pointed out, enclosed in a horny envelope which is no other than the hoof. We will first study the hoof of the horse--a hoof which is single for each of the limbs, inasmuch as in this animal each of these has but a single digit. =Hoofs of the Solipeds.=--We will first study the hoof as regarded in a general way--that is, without taking into account the limb to which it belongs. We will afterwards point out the differences presented when the hoofs of the fore and hind limbs are compared. In connection with the external forms of the horse, the study which we are now commencing is of great importance. But, before entering upon it, it appears to us necessary to rapidly examine what the hoof contains (Fig. 95). [Illustration: FIG. 95.--VERTICAL ANTERO-POSTERIOR SECTION OF THE FOOT OF A HORSE. 1, Third phalanx; 2, fibro-cartilage; 3, podophyllous tissue; 4, inferior part of the wall; 5, section of the wall of the hoof; 6, cutigerous cavity; 7, tendon of the anterior extensor of the phalanges; 8, reinforcing band coming from the suspensory ligament of the fetlock; 9, tendon of the superficial flexor of the phalanges; 10, tendon of the deep flexor of the phalanges.] In the interior of this horny box we find the third phalanx, a small sesamoid bone placed opposite to the posterior border of the latter, a portion of the inferior extremity of the second phalanx, and the tendons, which terminate at this region. To the third phalanx are added two fibro-cartilaginous plates, flattened laterally, which prolong backwards the bone to which they are annexed. The inferior border of each of these fibro-cartilages is fixed by its anterior part to two osseous prominences situated at each of the angles which terminate the small phalanx behind; these prominences are: _the basilar process_ and _the retrorsal process_ (Fig. 96); by its posterior part, this border is continuous with a structure known as _the plantar cushion_ (see further on). The posterior border is directed obliquely upwards and forwards. The superior border, which is convex or rectilinear, is thin, and is separated from the posterior border by an obtuse angle. Finally, the anterior border, which is directed obliquely downwards and backwards, is united to the ligamentous apparatus, which keeps the second and third phalanges in contact. These fibro-cartilages, at their upper extremities, project beyond the hoof, and therefore assist in the formation of the lateral regions of the foot,[35] at the part which is called the _crown_. They project less above the hoof in the posterior limbs. [35] Here, for the first time, apropos of the hoof, we use the word 'foot.' As in osteology and in myology we have, for the sake of clearness of comparison, designated under this name the region limited above by the tarsus, it is necessary to point out here that we employ the same word for a more restricted region. This we did in conformity with the usage of veterinarians, who so designate the region of the hoof. It is necessary to explain this double employment of the word, and, further, to show the particular meaning ascribed to it. [Illustration: FIG. 96.--THIRD PHALANX OF THE HORSE: LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB, EXTERNAL SURFACE. 1, Pyramidal eminence; 2, surface, for articulation with the inferior extremity of the second phalanx; 3, basilar process; 4, retrorsal process.] The posterior and inferior borders of these cartilages meet at an acute angle. The angle so formed, or cartilaginous bulb, constitutes the base of the region, which is commonly called the _heel_--a part of the foot which, as its name implies, is situated posteriorly, but which we must not confound, as we might be led to do, with the region occupied by the calcaneum. We know from our previous studies of comparative osteology that this latter is situated much higher up. The _plantar cushion_ is a sort of fibrous wedge which occupies the interval bounded by the fibro-cartilaginous plates which we have just been studying. Its inferior surface, the form of which we shall find to be reproduced by a portion of the corresponding surface of the hoof, is prolonged anteriorly into a point, while behind it is divided into two branches, which, diverging from one another, join the posterior angles of the fibro-cartilages. These two branches are separated by a median excavation. The different constituent elements which we have just been discussing give elasticity to the foot. To finish the examination of the parts contained in the hoof, we will add that among them is also found what is called the fleshy _envelope_, or _flesh_ of the foot. We divide the latter into three regions: the podophyllous tissue, striated or laminated flesh which is spread out over the anterior surface of the third phalanx; the pad, or the hardened skin which corresponds to the upper border of the hoof, and forms a prominence above the podophyllous tissue; and the villous flesh, or velvety tissue which covers the plantar surface of the third phalanx and the plantar cushion. These three tissues form as a whole the keratogenic membrane--that is to say, that which produces horny tissue, and consequently regenerates the hoof. It is this latter that we now proceed to study. When we examine its anterior surface or the opposite one, the hoof of the horse has the shape of a truncated cone with the base below and the summit cut off obliquely downwards and backwards (Fig. 97). Viewed on one of its lateral aspects, it may be compared to a truncated cylinder placed on the surface of the section (Fig. 98). We particularly call attention to this latter comparison, for it singularly aids us in making a representation of the foot of the horse when viewed laterally. Notwithstanding that the hoof forms apparently a homogeneous whole, it consists of three parts, which may be separated from one another by maceration. The indication of such disunion, artificially produced, may seem useless. It is not so, however, for this division of the hoof will permit us to carry out the study of the latter in a clearer, and consequently a more satisfactory, way. The three parts in question are the _wall_, or _crust_, the _sole_, and the _frog_. The _wall_ is that portion of the hoof which we see when the foot rests on the ground. It is a plate of horn which, applied to the anterior and lateral surfaces of the foot, diminishes in height as it approaches the posterior part of the region. Posteriorly and at each side the wall is folded on itself, and is then directed forwards to terminate in a point, after having enclosed the frog, which we will soon study. [Illustration: FIG. 97.--LEFT ANTERIOR FOOT OF THE HORSE: ANTERIOR ASPECT. 1, Outer side; 2, inner side.] Although the wall forms a continuous whole, it has been divided into regions to which special names are given. The anterior part, from the superior border to the inferior, is called the _pince_ or _toe_ for a width of 4 to 5 centimetres. External to the toe, and on each side of it, for a distance of 3 or 4 centimetres, is the _nipple_. Behind the _nipples_ are the _quarters_. Still further back, where the wall folds on itself, forming the _buttress_, is found the region of the _heels_. Finally, the portions of the wall which form its continuation in passing forward are called the _bars_.[36] These are only visible on the inferior surface of the hoof (see Fig. 100). [36] It is to the angle of inflexion or heel that some authors give the name of buttress; it is the bars which other authors designate in this fashion. The wall, convex transversely, is, in its anterior part (viz., the _toe_) inclined strongly downwards and forwards. This obliquity tends to become gradually effaced on the lateral parts to such a degree that at the quarters it becomes almost perpendicular to the surface of the ground. The internal quarter is less rounded than the external; in addition to this (Fig. 97), it approaches more nearly to the vertical direction. [Illustration: FIG. 98.--LEFT ANTERIOR FOOT OF THE HORSE: EXTERNAL ASPECT. 1, Fetlock; 2, spur or beard; 3, pastern; 4, outline determined by the external fibro-cartilage; 5, acute angle; 6, nipple; 7, quarter; 8, heel.] In our opinion, this latter difference clearly recalls certain characters of the general form of the human foot. In fact, the latter has its dorsal surface inclined downwards and outwards, whereas its internal border may be said rather to be vertical. A transverse section of the foot (Fig. 99) justifies this comparison, which to us appears interesting, not only as regards the resemblance which exists between these organs of support, but, further, because it constitutes a mnemonic which enables us, on condition that we remember the form of the human foot, to recall the above-described character of that of the horse. The greater convexity of the outer portion of the hoof is found equally on the human foot; the external border of this foot is more convex than the opposite one. The inferior border of the wall (Fig. 100) is, in the case of unshod horses, always in wear when in contact with the ground. It is intimately united to the circumference of the sole (see further on). [Illustration: FIG. 99.--VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION OF A LEFT HUMAN FOOT: OUTLINE OF THE DIVIDED SURFACE OF THE POSTERIOR SEGMENT OF THIS SECTION (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE). AAÂ´, Vertical axis passing through the middle of the leg and the second toe; 1, outer side; 2, inner side.] The superior border is hollowed on its internal surface by a groove, the cutigerous cavity or basil, which lodges the cushion (see Fig. 95). We have described this latter above, in connection with the flesh of the foot. The substance of the wall presents a fibrous appearance which is pretty strongly pronounced. The constituent fibres from which this appearance results are directed from the superior border towards the inferior in parallel and regular lines. The _sole_ is a horny plate which occupies the inferior surface of the hoof (Fig. 100). It is situated between the inferior border of the wall and the bars; and, on account of the oblique direction of these latter, it presents a strongly-marked groove of a [V]-form, with the opening directed backwards. In this depression is lodged the frog. The inferior surface is concave, and thus forms a sort of vault, more or less deep, according to the individual. The sole has a scaly, laminated aspect. We have seen (Fig. 93, and p. 249) that on the inferior surface of the claws of carnivora is found a small interval which is filled by a plate of a more friable horny substance, to which has been given the name of the plantar nail. It seems to us that there is an interesting relationship between the said plantar nail and the sole which we have just been studying. [Illustration: FIG. 100.--INFERIOR SURFACE OF A FORE-HOOF OF THE HORSE: LEFT SIDE. 1, Internal border of the wall (toe); 2, wall; 3, quarter; 4, heel; 5, bar; 6, sole; 7, frog; 8, median cavity; 9, prominence of the frog; 10, lateral cavity.] Indeed, these two horny structures appear to be homologous. Is not the lamina of the claw comparable to the wall of the hoof? And does not the interval which occurs at the inferior part of this latter, and is filled by the sole, recall that which, in extremely reduced form, is filled by the plantar portion of the claws? The _frog_ (Fig. 100) is a mass of horn, in form of a wedge, with its apex in front, which occupies the space limited laterally by the recurved portions of the wall (the bars) and the posterior border of the sole. It covers the plantar cushion previously described (p. 252) and reproduces its form. Its inferior surface is hollowed out in the middle by an excavation, which is known as the _median lacuna_. This cavity separates the branches of the frog, which terminate posteriorly by two swellings which are known as _the prominences of the frog_, forming two rounded elevations situated above the claws. These same branches unite in front of the median lacuna to form the body of the frog. This latter, in its anterior part, gradually narrows, and terminates in a point which occupies the bottom of the hollow limited laterally by the bars of the wall and the posterior border of the sole. Between the lateral surfaces of the frog and the bars are found two angular cavities--_the lateral lacunÃ¦_, or the _commissures of the frog_. [Illustration: FIG. 101.--THIRD PHALANX OF THE HORSE: LEFT ANTERIOR LIMB, INFERIOR VIEW. 1, External border; 2, internal border; 3, semilunar crest; 4, 4, re-entrant processes.] [Illustration: FIG. 102.--THIRD PHALANX OF THE HORSE: LEFT POSTERIOR LIMB, INFERIOR VIEW. 1, External border; 2, internal border; 3, semilunar crest; 4, 4, re-entrant processes.] As an indispensable complement to the study which we have just made, it is necessary to add that the hoofs of the fore-limbs and those of the hind ones present differences of form which cannot be ignored--differences which we are already able to conjecture by looking at the respective third phalanges which terminate those limbs, and especially at their inferior surfaces (Figs. 101, 102). The hoofs of the fore-limbs (see Fig. 100), viewed on their plantar surface, are more rounded than those of the hind-limbs (Fig. 103)--so that their external contour may be compared to a semicircle--whilst the hind-hoofs, which are narrow and of more oval shape, rather recall by their form the aspect of an ogive. This seems to result from the fact that the fore-limbs support the more considerable part of the weight of the animal. The best proof which can be given of this overweighting is the eagerness with which very often, when a horse is stopped near the edge of a footpath, for example, he places his fore-feet on the latter. In thus raising his fore-quarters, he throws part of his weight backwards, and in this way relieves his fore-limbs. [Illustration: FIG. 103.--INFERIOR SURFACE OF A HIND-HOOF OF A HORSE: LEFT SIDE. 1, External border; 2, internal border.] With regard to the difference of form which we have just pointed out, we have sometimes heard the following comparison made: the contour of the hoofs of the fore-limbs, viewed from below, recalls that of an apple; that of the hoofs of the hind-limbs recalls the outline of a pear. As a mnemonic this comparison is insufficient, for nothing connects either of the forms indicated with the region to which the hoofs belong. We much prefer one made for us this very year by one of the students of our course at the School of Fine Arts, after the lecture in which we had just pointed out the differences in question. Giving the idea of a semicircle and an ogive, which we described above, he remarked to us that the idea would perhaps be more easily fixed in the memory if we associated with it the idea of the chronological order in which the Roman and ogival art succeeded. Indeed, as the Roman art preceded the ogival art, so the hoofs which have the semicircular form precede those which have the form of an ogive. This interpretation appeared to us ingenious; this is why we wished to give it here a place which seems to us to be merited. [Illustration: FIG. 104.--LEFT POSTERIOR FOOT OF A HORSE: EXTERNAL ASPECT.] The wall of the hoof of a fore-limb, viewed on one of its lateral surfaces (see Fig. 98), is more oblique than that of one of the hind-hoofs looked at in the same way (Fig. 104). This difference, very marked especially at the region of the toe, is correlated with that of the direction of the pastern. In fact, in the anterior limbs this is a little more oblique than in the opposite ones. We have still to describe, in connection with the horse, some epidermic tissues, which are known as _chestnuts_. The chestnut is a small, horny plate which is found on the internal surface of each of the limbs, at a level differing on the anterior from that of the posterior ones. On the anterior limbs the chestnut is situated on the internal surface of the forearm, towards the middle part, or the inferior third of this region. On the posterior limbs it is developed on the back of the superior extremity of the internal surface of the canon, towards the inferior part of the ham--that is, the tarsus. [Illustration: FIG. 105.--FOOT OF THE OX: LEFT SIDE, ANTERO-EXTERNAL VIEW. 1, Internal hoof; 2, external hoof; 3, internal surface of this latter; 4, internal spur.] Inasmuch as some authors consider the chestnuts as being vestiges of the thumb and the great-toe, we propose giving a mnemonic which will enable us to remember their situation, or, rather, their difference of level. If we consider that the thumb, in the human species, is longer than the first toe, we may easily remember that the chestnut is placed higher in the anterior limbs than in the posterior ones. Indeed, if we suppose a digit taking its origin at these points, it will be longer in front (the thumb) than behind (the first toe). =Hoofs of the Ox and the Pig.=--The ox has four hoofs on each foot--two which contain the third phalanges, and two others, rudimentary, situated at the posterior aspect of the limb, at the level of the inferior part of the canon; these latter bear the name of _spurs_. We will occupy ourselves especially with the former (Fig. 105). Each of the hoofs presents three faces which, if we consider them in relation to the median axis of the limb to which they belong, are: external, internal, and inferior. The external surface resembles the wall of the hoof of the horse. The internal surface is slightly concave from before backwards, so that the external and internal hoofs of the same foot are not in contact with each other, except by the extremities of this surface, and that an interval separates them between these two points. The inferior surface, slightly depressed, ends behind in a swelling produced by the plantar cushion, which covers a thin lamina of horn. At the anterior part of the hoof these three surfaces unite in forming a well-marked angle which, on account of the concavity of the internal surface, is slightly curved towards the axis of the foot. The pig has also four hoofs--two for the great digits and two for the lateral digits. They recall those of the ox. CHAPTER IV PROPORTIONS Inasmuch as we have taken for granted, in connection with the present volume, that before entering on the study of the anatomy of quadrupeds the reader was prepared for it by a sufficient knowledge of human anatomy, it is quite natural that we should extend the same supposition to the study of proportions. For this reason, the definition of proportions, considered from a general point of view, their signification, their function and their utility, are questions which it would be superfluous to enter upon here. We will content ourselves by calling to mind that the common measure chosen by preference is the length of the head, and that, ordinarily, it is with it that we compare the dimensions of other parts. Among the animals whose structure we have examined, there is one of which the proportions deserve to be marked in preference to every other: this is the horse. Wherefore this preference? In the first place, it is because of the overwhelming position which this animal occupies in the artistic representation of quadrupeds; that it is more frequently associated with man; that, notwithstanding its division into different races, its general proportions may be referred to a special type. It is also because the indications relative to these proportions will suffice to show the way which the artist must follow in order to find for himself, at the time when the necessity for it arises, the proportions which characterize the other animals. Our intention is not, in connection with the subject which now occupies us, to enter into a deep discussion on the various opinions which have been set forth. We desire, above all, to give some indications which, from the practical point of view, can be utilized in the representation of the horse, and at the beginning to demonstrate the advantages of these indications. Now, there is a fact which we have had occasion to note; it is the following: almost invariably, when a person who is little accustomed to represent the horse, or not previously informed of certain proportions of lengths, begins to draw from nature, the error generally committed is that of making the head too small and the body too long. Is it a preconceived idea which is the cause that one regards them in this manner? Perhaps. At all events, certain artists who have made the representation of horses their special study have even had this habit. It is therefore necessary to be informed of the proportions; this is the object of the study which we are now undertaking. Bourgelat,[37] in the eighteenth century, fixed for the first time and in complete fashion the proportions of the horse; it is he, consequently, who created the Ã¦sthetics of the horse. It is but justice to recall the fact. His system has a point of analogy with that which is employed to determine the human proportions. Indeed, Bourgelat chose the length of the head as a standard of measurement, and the subdivisions of the head for measures of less extent. 'Since beauty,' said he,[38] 'resides in the congruity and proportion of the parts, it is absolutely necessary to observe the dimensions, individual and relative, and in order to acquire a knowledge of the proportions, to assume a kind of measure which can be indiscriminately common for all horses. The part which can serve as a standard of proportion for all the others is the head. Take a measurement between two parallel lines--one tangent to the nape of the neck or the summit of the forelock, the other tangent to the extremity of the anterior lip--a line perpendicular to these two tangents will give you its geometrical length. Divide this length into three portions, and give to these three parts a special name, which may be applied indefinitely to all heads--as, for example, that of _prime_. Any head whatsoever will, accordingly, in its geometrical length, always have three _primes_; but all the parts which you will have to consider, whether in their length, in their height, or in their width, cannot constantly have either one prime, or a prime and a half, or three primes; subdivide, then, each _prime_ into three equal parts, which you will name _seconds_, and as this subdivision will not suffice to give you a just measure of all the parts, subdivide anew each _second_ into twenty-four _points_, so that a head divided into three _primes_ will have, by the second division, nine _seconds_, and two hundred and sixteen _points_ by the last.' [37] Claude Bourgelat, founder of the veterinary schools in France. He was born at Lyons in 1712, and died at Paris in 1779. [38] Bourgelat, 'ÃlÃ©ments de l'art vÃ©tÃ©rinaire. TraitÃ© de la conformation extÃ©rieure du cheval,' Paris, edition of 1785, p. 133. But where this system appears to us to have lost somewhat of its unity is when the author transforms it, in pointing out the following mode of procedure: 'But the head itself may err by default of proportion. This part is not, indeed, considered as either too short or too long, too thin or too thick, but by comparison with the body of the animal. Now, the body, being required to have--whether in length, reckoning from the point of the arm to the prominence of the buttock, or in height, reckoning from the summit of the withers to the ground--two heads and a half; whenever the head, by its geometrical length, shall give, in length or in height, to the body measured more than two and a half times its own length, it will be too short; and if it gives less, it will be too long. 'In the case in which one of these faults exists there would be no further question of establishing by its geometrical length the proportions of the other parts. Give up this common measure, and measure the height or the length of the body; divide the length or the height into five equal portions; take, then, two of these divisions, divide them into _primes_, _seconds_, and _points_, corresponding to the divisions and subdivisions which you would have made of the head, and you will have a common measure, such as the head would have given you if it had been proportionate.'[39] [39] Bourgelat, _loc. cit._, p. 135. [Illustration: FIG. 106.--THE PROPORTIONS OF THE HORSE (AFTER BOURGELAT). _To face p. 265._] We understand, up to a certain point, that Bourgelat may have been able to give this advice which, generally speaking, is sufficiently practical, since, in certain cases, he was able to pronounce that such a head was too small or too large. But it is always mischievous, with regard to the effect produced on the reader, to propose to him, in the application of a rule, to suppress the foundation on which this rule is established. Besides, even if all the measurements compared with the two-fifths of the length of the body are proportionate with regard to one another, the animal, in spite of this, since the head must be taken into consideration, will, in a strict sense, be none the less disproportioned. The proportions given by Bourgelat are as follows[40] (Fig. 106): [40] _Ibid._, p. 136, and onward. 1. =Three geometrical lengths of the head= give: _The full height_ of the horse, reckoned from the forelock to the ground on which he rests, provided that the head be well placed.[41] [41] By 'the head being well placed,' Bourgelat means 'vertically posed,' the outline of the forehead then coinciding with a vertical line, which at the other end touches the anterior portion of the nose. 2. =Two heads and a half= (B)[42] equals: [42] The letters in parentheses relate to the corresponding measures marked by the same letters on the third diagram of Fig. 106. _The height of the body_ from the summit of the withers to the ground. _The length of the same body_, those of the forehand and of the hind-quarter taken as a whole from the point of the arm to the point of the buttock inclusive. 3. =An entire head= (A) gives: _The length of the forepart_ from the summit of the withers to the termination of the neck. _The height of the shoulders_ from the summit of the elbow to the top of the withers. _The thickness of the body_ from the middle of the belly to the middle of the back. _The width_ from one side to the other. 4. =A head measured from the top of the forelock to the commissure of the lips= (C). This measurement slightly curtailed, unless the mouth is very deeply cleft, equals: _The length of the crupper_, taken from the superior point of the anterior angle of the ilium to the tuberosity of the ischium, forming the point of the buttock. _The width of the crupper or of the haunches_, taken from the inferior points of the angles of the ilia. _The height of the crupper_, viewed laterally, taken from the summit of the posterior angles of the ilia to the point of the patella, the leg being in a state of rest. _The lateral measure of the posterior limb_, from the point of the patella, to the lateral and salient part of the ham, to the right of the articulation of the tibia with the trochlea. _The perpendicular height of the articulation above named_ above the ground. _The distance from the point of the arm_ to the angle formed by the junction of the head and neck. _The distance from the summit of the withers_ to the junction of the neck with the thorax. 5. =Twice this last measure= (C)[43] gives almost: [43] The proportions given in the two paragraphs 6 and 7 are, under another form, the same as those pointed out in paragraph 2, with this difference, that in this latter they are more clearly expressed. _The distance of the summit of the withers_ to the tip of the patella. _The distance of the point of the elbow_ to the summit of the crupper or the posterior angles of the ilia. 6. =Three times this measure, plus a half-width of the pastern, the equivalent of two heads and a half=, will give: _The height of the body_, taken from the top of the withers to the ground. _Its length_, taken from the point of the arm to the point of the buttock inclusive. 7. =This same measure, plus the entire width of the pastern=, gives: _The total length of the body_, taken accurately. 8. =Two-thirds the length of the head= (D) will equal: _The width of the chest_, from the tip of one arm to that of the other, from outside to outside. _The horizontal measurement of the crupper_ taken between two verticals, of which one forms a tangent to the buttock, and the other passes through the summit of the crupper and touches the tip of the patella. _The third of the length of the hind-quarter and of the body_ taken together, as far as the vertical from the withers, touching the elbow. _The anterior length of the hind-limb_, taken from the tuberosity of the tibia to the fold of the ham. 9. =One-half of the length of the head= (E) is the same as: _The horizontal distance from the tip of the arm_ to the vertical line from the summit of the withers and touching the elbow. _The width of the neck_, viewed laterally, taken from its insertion in the trough of the jaw to the roots of the first hairs of the mane, on a line which forms with the superior contour two equal angles. 10. =One-third of the entire length of the head= (F) gives: _The height of its superior part_ from the summit of the forelock to a line which passes through the most salient points of the orbits. _The width of the head_ below the lower eyelids. _The lateral width of the forearm_, taken from its anterior origin to the point of the elbow. 11. =Two-thirds of this length=[44] (G) gives: [44] That is to say, two-ninths of the whole length of the head. _The distance of the point of the elbow_ above the plane of the lower surface of the sternum. _The depression of the back_ in relation to the summit of the withers. _The lateral width of the posterior limbs near the hams._ _The space or distance of the forearms from one ars_[45] to the opposite. [45] We call the region where the superior and internal part of the forearm is joined to the trunk the 'ars.' The space between the ars of one side and the ars of the opposite side is called the 'inter-ars.' 12. =One-half of the third of the entire length of the head=[46] (H) equals: [46] That is to say, one-sixth of the total length of the head. _The thickness of the forearm_, viewed from the front, and taken horizontally from the ars to its external surface. _The width of the crown of the fore-feet_ whether from one side to the other, or from before backwards. _The width of the crown of the hind-feet_, from one side to the other only. _The width of the posterior fetlocks_, taken from the front to the origin of the spur. _The width of the knee_ seen from the front. Note: this measure is a little too large. _The thickness of the ham._ Note: this measure is a little under the mark. 13. =One-fourth of the third of the length of the head=[47] (I) gives: [47] That is, one-twelfth of the length of the head. _The thickness of the canon of the fore-limb_: that of the hind-quarter is a little thicker. 14. =One-third of this same measure=[48] (K) equals: [48] That is, a ninth of the length of the head. _The thickness of the fore-limb close to the knee_ in its narrowest part. _The thickness of the posterior pasterns_, viewed laterally. 15. =The height from the elbow to the fold of the knee= (L) is the same as: _The height from this same fold to the earth._ _The height from the patella to the fold of the ham._ _The height from the fold of the ham to the crown._ 16. =The sixth part of this measure= (M) gives: _The width of the canon of the fore-limb_, viewed laterally, in the middle of its length. _The fetlock_, viewed from the front. 17. =The third of this same measure= (N) is very nearly equal to: _The width of the ham_, from the fold to the point. 18. =A fourth of this measure= (O) gives: _The width of the knee_, measured laterally. _The length of the knee._ 19. =The interval between the eyes from one great angle to the other= (P) equals: _The width of the hind-leg_, viewed laterally, from the cleft of the buttocks to the inferior part of the tuberosity of the tibia. 20. =One-half of this interval between the eyes= (1/2 P) gives: _The width of the posterior canon-bone_, viewed laterally. _The width of the fetlock of the fore-limb_, from its anterior summit to the root of the spur. Finally, the difference of the height of the crupper with respect to the summit of the withers. It is certain that the multiplicity of these proportions, and above all the exaggeration of details into which Bourgelat fell in indicating certain of the measures which constitute the bases of some of them, may repel the reader. For this cause we desire to add to the preceding, and also because the question which we are treating would be incomplete without it, the results obtained and published by other more modern authors, and in particular by Colonel Duhousset.[49] [49] E. Duhousset, 'Le Cheval,' Paris, 1881. This author, one of whose constant occupations is the measurement of the different regions of the horse, has the incontestable merit of having drawn attention to this question, and of having strained all his energies in the propagation of the knowledge which until then was little diffused. Among the proportions which he recommends, there are some which are the result of his own observations; whilst others, which he has verified and adopted, are the result of a judicious selection of those given by Bourgelat, which we have just reproduced in the preceding pages. We join thereto also certain indications furnished by MM. A. Goubeaux and G. Barrier,[50] distinguishing these latter by the initials (G. and B.) of their authors (Fig. 107). [50] Armand Goubeaux and Gustave Barrier, 'De l'extÃ©rieure du Cheval,' Paris, 1882. =The length of the head almost exactly equals=: 1. Depth from the back to the belly, N, O,[51] the thickness of the body.[52] [51] Look for the points indicated by these letters on Fig. 107, which is related to the proportions which are here discussed. [52] The proportion previously indicated by Bourgelat (see p. 265, paragraph 3). 2. From the summit of the withers to the point of the arm, H, E. 3. From the superior fold of the stifle to the point of the ham, JÂ´, J. 4. From the point of the ham to the ground, J, K. 5. From the dorsal angle of the scapula to the point of the haunch, D, D. [Illustration: FIG. 107.--PROPORTIONS OF THE HORSE (AFTER COLONEL DUHOUSSET).] 6. From the passage of the girth to the fetlock, M, I, or higher in large horses and racers; to the middle of the fetlock or lower for small ones and those of medium size. 7. From the superior fold of the stifle to the summit of the crupper in those specimens whose coxo-femoral angle is very open. This distance is always much less in others (G. and B.).[53] [53] A proportion relative to the same region, and which at the outset might appear similar, is pointed out by Bourgelat (see p. 266, paragraph 4). But there exists a difference, for Bourgelat compared the length of the head, measured from the forelock to the commissure of the lips, and not that of the entire head, to the distance which separates the summit of the rump and the tip of the patella. =Two and a half times the length of the head= gives: 1. The height of the withers, H, above the ground.[54] [54] This proportion is that given by Bourgelat (see p. 265, paragraph 2). 2. The height of the summit of the crupper above the ground.[55] [55] Consequently the withers and the crupper, being the same height, are situated on the same horizontal plane. Bourgelat, on the contrary, points out a difference of level in connection with these regions. According to him the summit of the crupper is situated below the horizontal plane passing the withers, and this distance equals half of the space which separates the great angle of one eye from that of the other (see p. 269, paragraph 20). 3. Very often the length of the body, from the point of the arm to that of the buttock, although for a long time the type of Bourgelat had been set aside as a conventional model, short and massive.[56] [56] See p. 265, paragraph 2. And M. Duhousset adds to this: 'The drawing that we offer, which has two heads and a half in height and length, is that of a horse which we frequently meet with' (see Fig. 107; see also p. 279, where we again consider this question of the length of the body of the horse). 'The crupper, from the point of the haunch to that of the buttock, D, F, is always less than that of the head. This difference varies from 5 to 10 centimetres. The width of the crupper, from one haunch to the other, often very slightly exceeds its length.' MM. Goubeaux and Barrier add that frequently it equals it.[57] [57] If we refer to the proportions indicated by Bourgelat, we shall find that the proportions relative to the crupper are also indicated there (see p. 266, paragraph 4). 'The crupper, such as we have just defined it, D, H, may also be found to a fair degree of exactness, as regards length, four times on the same horse.' 1. From the point of the buttock to the inferior part of the stifle, F, P. 2. The width of the neck, a little in front of the withers to a little above the point of the arm, S, X.[58] [58] MM. Goubeaux and Barrier replace this by the following: 'The width of neck at its inferior attachment from its insertion into the chest to the origin of the withers, S, X.' Bourgelat discovered the same proportion (see p. 266, last line of paragraph 4). 3. From this latter point to below the lower jaw, X, Q, when the head is naturally placed parallel to the shoulders, E, H.[59] [59] MM. Goubeaux and Barrier replace this by the following: 'From the insertion of the neck into the chest to the lower border of the lower jaw, X, Q, when the head is parallel to the shoulder.' 4. From the nape to the nostrils, _n, nÂ´_.[60] [60] MM. Goubeaux and Barrier add: 'Or to the commissure of the lips.' It is thus, besides, that Bourgelat measured the head for comparison with the crupper (see p. 266, paragraph 4). The measure of =half of the head= also acts as a good guide for the construction of the horse, when we know that it frequently applies to many of the parts--to wit: 1. From the forehead above the eyes, perpendicular to the line which is tangent to the lower jaw, P, Q. 2. Outline of the neck at the level of the base of the head, Q, L.[61] [61] Proportion indicated by Bourgelat (see p. 267, paragraph 9). 3. From the crown of the fore-foot to below the knee, T, TÂ´. 4. In the legs, from the base of the fetlock to that of the ham, U, V. 5. Finally, it is nearly of the length of the humerus from the point E to the radius.[62] [62] MM. Goubeaux and Barrier replace these by the following: 1. 'From the most prominent part of the lower jaw to the profile of the forehead above the eye, P, Q (thickness of the head). 2. 'From the throat to the superior border of the neck behind the nape, Q, L (attachment of the head). 3. 'From the inferior part of the knee to the crown, T, TÂ´. 4. 'From the base of the ham to the fetlock, U, V. 5. 'Finally, from the point of the arm to the articulation of the elbow (approximate length of the arm).' PROPORTIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE HORSE[63] [63] Extract from the work of MM. Goubeaux and Barrier on the exterior of the horse. As before, the initials G. and B. of these authors are added. Although it is very difficult, says M. Duhousset, when we speak of measurements taken on the living animal, to formulate other than approximations, we believe we have determined with sufficient accuracy the following results, which are the outcome of our numerous observations. The head which we present is that of a horse which we have frequently come across as a mean term between the highly bred and the draught horse. Under this heading, it will not be devoid of interest to accompany with dimensions the two drawings to which are consigned the measurements in question. =Head viewed in Profile= (Fig. 108).--Length, A, B, from the nape to the margin of the lips, 0Â·60 metre. Thickness, C, D, from the angle of the lower jaw to the anterior surface (a half-head), 0Â·30 metre. This line passes through the middle of the eye, taken perpendicularly, to the profile of the anterior surface. Many common horses present it, especially the heavier draught horses; in finely-bred subjects it is a little shorter (G. and B.). Depth, I, H, of the neck in its narrowest part (a half-head), 0Â·30 metre. It is frequently greater; this is noticeable in all instances where the superior parts of the neck are deficient in fineness. It is this which we see in draught horses, and in those which become too fleshy (G. and B.). Distance, O, R, of the internal commissure of the eye from the superior border of the commissure of the nostril (G. and B.) (a half-head), 0Â·30 metre. It is more considerable on the common head, and on that which is too long. Distance, A, O, from the nape to the internal angle of the eye, 0Â·22 metre. This distance is equivalent to the thickness of the head, P, Q, taken perpendicularly from the profile of the anterior surface, and passing at the level of the maxillary fissure and spine. It is, again, equal to Q, O, from the internal angle of the eye to the maxillary fissure; and to P, G, from the middle of the face to the commissure of the lips (G. and B.). The distance, P, E, from the middle of the face to the maxillary spine is about the sixth of the total length of the head--0Â·10 metre. [Illustration: FIG. 108.--PROPORTIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE HORSE, VIEWED IN PROFILE (AFTER COLONEL DUHOUSSET).] The line B, E, reckoned from the extremity of the lips to the maxillary spine, is equal: To E, F, from the maxillary spine to the external auditory meatus, to be seen only on the skull; To H, G, from the insertion of the neck in the trough to the commissure of the lips (G. and B.); To Q, R, from the maxillary fissure to the superior commissure of the nostril (G. and B.); To Q, B, from the fissure of the maxilla to the border of the lips (G. and B.); To O, D, from the internal angle of the eye to the angle of the lower jaw, provided that the line C, D be in proportion (G. and B.). [Illustration: FIG. 109.--THE SAME DESIGN AS THAT OF FIG. 108, ON WHICH WE HAVE INDICATED, BY SIMILAR LINES, THE PRINCIPAL CORRESPONDING MEASUREMENTS. Half the length of the head, and the dimensions which equal it; distance which separate the nape from the internal angle of the eye, and the dimensions which equal it; distance which separates the internal angle of the eye from the border of the lips, and the dimensions which equal it.[64]] [64] It is thus that in our teaching, but by means of lines of different colours, we present the proportions reproduced in Fig. 108. Experience has demonstrated to us that this replacement of letters by conventional lines renders the proportions more easily appreciable, and that these lines, striking the eye more forcibly, then impress themselves better on the memory. Fig. 111 bears the same relation to Fig. 110. Finally, very frequently to O, H, from the internal angle of the eye to the insertion of the throat into the maxillary trough (G. and B.). An equality still more frequent is that which exists between the distances: O, B, from the internal angle of the eye to the margin of the lips; A, H, from the nape to the insertion of the throat into the maxillary trough; And H, B, from this latter point to the margins of the lips. [Illustration: FIG. 110.--PROPORTIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE HORSE, SEEN FROM THE FRONT (AFTER COLONEL DUHOUSSET).] =The Head, Front View= (Fig. 110).--If, to continue our examination, adds M. Duhousset, we regard the head from the front, we find its greatest width at A, B, the extreme points of the orbital arches. This width is 22 centimetres. It is again equal to: A, C, from one arch to the nape; A, D, from one arch to the middle of the face. D, E, from the middle of the face to the margin of the lips. From the auditory canal, G, to the maxillary spine, F, is the same distance as from this point to the margins of the lips, E, or, better, to the end of the teeth. [Illustration: FIG. 111.--THE SAME FIGURE AS FIG. 110, ON WHICH WE HAVE MARKED BY SIMILAR LINES THE PRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS WHICH CORRESPOND THERETO. Distance which separates one of the orbital arches from that of the opposite side, and the dimensions which equal it; distance which separates the auditory meatus from the maxillary spine, and the dimensions which equal it; distance which separates one maxillary spine from that of the opposite side, and the dimensions which equal it; distance which separates the lip of one side from that of the opposite, and the dimensions which equal it.[65]] [65] See the note relative to Fig. 109. The line G, C, from the auditory meatus to the nape, is equal to the sixth of the head, 10 centimetres; the line A, G, from the orbital arch to the auditory meatus, is a little longer, and measures 12 centimetres. The distance F, I, comprised between the maxillary spines, is 18 centimetres. It is equal to: O, O, the distance between the internal angles of the eyes (G. and B.); F, R, the distance from the maxillary spine to the superior commissure of the corresponding nostril (G. and. B.); F, P, from the maxillary spine to the _salt-cellar_.[66] [66] We designate under the name _salt-cellar_ a depression situated external to the frontal region and above the eye. From the nape to the internal angle of the eye, C, O, is the same distance as from this latter point to the commissure of the lips, O, T; and from the maxillary spine to the upper lip F, S (G. and B.). The distance apart, T, T, of the two commissures of the lips gives, very nearly, the distance from the superior border of the orbital arch to the base of the ear or the auditory meatus. In the state of rest, the outer limit of the separation of the nostrils does not exceed the width of the knee;[67] we frequently find the same distance intercepted above the nape by the tranquil ears. In the figure (Fig. 110) we have intentionally represented them directed in a different plane, in order to show that when the pinna is turned backward, it none the less preserves the contour of bracket form, more or less pronounced according to the breeding of the subject, and characterizing in repose the interior curves of the ear. [67] We remind our readers that the name 'knee' is given by veterinarians to the region occupied by the carpus. The extreme limit of the lips, M, N, but very slightly exceeds that of the nostrils; on many heads of harmonious proportions this distance is found to be the half of A, B. In order not to interrupt the course of the preceding exposition, we decided to withhold till afterwards some reflections which have been suggested to us by certain of the proportions which are there indicated. The proportions in question are important--we may even say that they are fundamental, for they have for object the relation which exists between the length of the head, the height of the body, and the length of the latter. We have already seen that, according to Bourgelat, the length of the head is contained two and a half times in the length of the body, from the point of the arm to the point of the buttock; and, also, two and a half times in the height measured from the apex of the withers to the ground (see p. 265). We saw afterwards that M. Duhousset, having adopted these proportions, pointed out, further, that the same dimension was again found equally to exist from the summit of the crupper to the ground--a height which Bourgelat considered as being of less extent. There results, then, from the latter proportions, which we have just recalled, this interesting fact: that they simplify very much, from the point of view of design, the placing in position of the horse, on the condition always that this latter be always viewed directly on one of its lateral aspects. [Illustration: FIG. 112.--HORSE OF WHICH THE LENGTH CONTAINS MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES THAT OF THE HEAD, AND OF WHICH THIS DIMENSION (A, B) EXCEEDS THE HEIGHT.] Indeed, in this case, if we except the neck and the head, the body, inasmuch as its height and its length are equal, may be inscribed in a square, of which one of the sides corresponds to the withers and to the summit of the crupper, two of the other sides to the point of the arm and to that of the buttock the fourth being represented by the ground. This is simple, but this simplicity even has its inconveniences. It follows that this proportion, thus expressed, seems to exclude from every artistic representation certain categories of horses, which upon the whole might be regarded as beautiful, and the existence of which in any case it would be a pity not to indicate. [Illustration: FIG. 113.--HORSE OF WHICH THE LENGTH CONTAINS MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES THAT OF THE HEAD, AND OF WHICH THIS DIMENSION (A, B) EXCEEDS THE HEIGHT.] Let us examine at the outset that which is relative to the length of the body, equal to two and a half times the length of the head. This proportion is sometimes met with, and therefore may be considered exact; but it is necessary to add that its existence is not discoverable in the majority of cases. That for some authors it constitutes a perfect model we will not gainsay, but it is our impression that, when it exists, the head appears a little large, or, more exactly, the body a little short. Without attaining exactly to three times the length of the head, as some authors (Saint-Bel, Vallon) have announced, the body of the horse, nevertheless, measured as is stated above, frequently contains it more than two and a half times. We give in support of this some outline reproductions, executed after photographs (Figs. 112, 113, 114). There still remains the question regarding the equality of the height and of the length of the body of the horse. This equality, after the proportions previously indicated, would seem bound to appear in all the cases observed. Now, if we measure the examples reproduced in Figs. 112, 113, and 114, we shall see that sometimes the two dimensions are unequal, the height being greater than the length, or inversely. [Illustration: FIG. 114.--HORSE OF WHICH THE LENGTH CONTAINS MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES THAT OF THE HEAD, AND OF WHICH THIS DIMENSION (A, B) IS INFERIOR TO THE HEIGHT.] It is the same, if we examine a certain number of specimens; we are able to determine that the proportion chosen in preference by authors is not exactly that which is oftenest met with. It will, very probably, be objected that it is so for the most beautiful types, and that the indifferent ones are generally the more numerous. The essential thing would be to know, above all, if the type of two heads and a half of length and of height is really the only beautiful one. However that may be, of the fifty African horses measured by M. Duhousset, only fourteen possessed the equality indicated; twenty-six were less long than high, and ten more long than high.[68] [68] E. Duhousset, 'The Horse,' Paris, 1881. CHAPTER V THE PACES OF THE HORSE As a completion of the studies we have just been making, some notions relative to the paces of the horse seem to us to be absolutely indicated. Let it be permitted to us to remind the reader in this connection that we have already been for twenty-one years occupied with this question, and that by means of an articulated figure, a sort of movable mannikin, we have endeavoured to demonstrate to artists the differences which characterize the various paces of the horse.[69] The arrangement then employed cannot, evidently, be used in the present volume, but we will inspire ourselves, in the preparation of the present chapter, with the elements of demonstration which we have employed, and which, in the course of our teaching, we have had the satisfaction of seeing favourably received. [69] Ãdouard Cuyer, 'Les Allures du Cheval,' demonstrated with the aid of a coloured, separable, and articulated table, Paris, 1883. This table was the subject of a note communicated to the Academy of Sciences by Professor Marey ('Comptes rendus de l'AcadÃ©mie de Sciences') at the meeting of June 26, 1882. On the other hand, it has been the subject of a presentation which we have had the honour of being permitted to make to the Academy of Fine Arts at the meeting of November 4, 1882. The fasciculus in question has been since united with a more complete whole as regards the study of the horse. E. Cuyer and E. Alex, 'Le Cheval: ExtÃ©rieur, Structure et Fonctions, Races,' avec 26 planches coloriÃ©es, dÃ©coupÃ©es et superposÃ©es, Paris, 1886. The progressive movements by which an individual transports himself from one place to another do not operate according to a unique method and with a constantly uniform velocity. These various modes of progression are designated under the name of _paces_. It is extremely difficult to analyze, by simple observation, the movements which characterize these gaits. Let us, for example, examine the displacements made by the limbs of a horse during that of walking; if we have no notion of these displacements, it will be, so to speak, impossible to determine in what order they are executed. The sight of the imprints left on the ground by the hoofs is not a sufficient means of demonstration, especially for artists. The noise made by the blows of these limbs, or by the little bells of different timbre suspended from them, are absolutely in the same case. Processes enabling us to fix or to register the paces are in every way preferable. Such really exist; they are: instantaneous photography and those which constitute the graphic method of Professor Marey. The results given by the photograph are certainly appreciable; but, from the didactic point of view, we give the preference to the graphic method, the general characters and the mode of application of which we now proceed to analyze.[70] [70] We cannot too strongly recommend the reading of the excellent works which Professor Marey has published, and which have for their object the study of movements, as well as the exhibition of the procedures which he has employed. E. J. Marey, 'La Machine Animale,' Paris, 1873; 'La MÃ©thode graphique dans les Sciences expÃ©rimentales,' Paris, 1884; 'Le Vol des Oiseaux,' Paris, 1890; 'Le Mouvement,' Paris, 1894. It is necessary to understand first of all, in this connection, that which relates to a man's walking pace. The method of Professor Marey rests on the following principle: Suppose two rubber globes connected with one another by a tube. If we compress one of these globes, the air which it contains will be driven into the other, and will afterwards return when the pressure has ceased. Nothing more simple, evidently; but it is necessary to describe it in detail in order the better to comprehend that which follows: The walker who is the subject of experiment is furnished with special shoes (Fig. 115), having thick indiarubber soles, hollowed in the interior, so that the whole thus constituted forms a sort of hollow cushion which is compressed under the influence of the pressure of the foot on the ground. A tube which is attached to a registering apparatus, which the person who is walking carries in his hand, communicates with this cavity (Fig. 116). This apparatus is formed of a metal drum, which is closed at its upper part by a flexible membrane. Each time that one of the man's feet presses on the ground, the air contained in the cavity of the sole of the shoe is driven into the drum, which we have just mentioned, and the flexible membrane of this drum is elevated. To this membrane is attached a vertical rod which supports a horizontal style. [Illustration: FIG. 115.--EXPERIMENTAL SHOES, INTENDED TO RECORD THE PRESSURE OF THE FOOT ON THE GROUND.] When the membrane, as we have just seen, is elevated, the style is lifted, and then descends when the pressure of the foot ceases. It traces these displacements on a leaf of paper, the surface of which is covered with a thin layer of lamp-black, which it removes by its contact; different parts of this surface are successively presented to it, the paper being rolled round a cylinder which is turned on its axis by means of a clockwork movement. It is necessary to add that the inscription is made, in the study of the walk of man, by means of two styles, each corresponding to one of the feet. The tracings thus obtained, which are read from left to right, are sufficiently simple; but to understand them properly, it is necessary to remember that the style undergoes a movement of ascensional displacement during each pressure of a foot, and that, on the other hand, it descends when the latter is separated from the ground. We also see, on the tracing which it leaves, a line which ascends and then descends; the meaning of this is that first the foot presses on the ground, and is afterwards raised from it. [Illustration: FIG. 116.--RUNNER FURNISHED WITH THE EXPLORATORY AND REGISTERING APPARATUS OF THE VARIOUS PACES.] On the tracing (Fig. 117), the line D relates to the right foot; the line G, which is dotted so that it may not be confused with the preceding, corresponds to the left foot. The line G first ascends; the meaning of which is that the left foot presses on the ground; afterwards it descends: this indicates that the pressure of the foot has ceased. It is the same for the right foot. As we see, the pressures succeed each other; when the left foot touches the ground, the right is separated from it; when the latter presses the ground, it is the left which no longer rests there. The line O is related to the movements of the body, as indicated by the oscillations of the head. We will neglect these. But this tracing, which serves us for an example, is not, it must indeed be said, of very easy reading; it would be still less so if the paces of a horse were registered, for there would then be four lines, the entanglement of which would cause greater complication. These difficulties of reading need be no longer feared, if we transform the tracing into a notation by means of the following diagram. There are drawn (Fig. 118) below the graphic tracing two horizontal lines (1, 2). From the point where the line D rises (commencement of the pressure of the right foot), and from the point where this same line descends (end of the same pressure), we let fall two vertical lines joining the two horizontal ones mentioned above. At this plane, and between the two vertical lines, we mark a broad white one (_a, b_). This expresses, by its length, the duration of the period of pressure of the right foot. In doing the same for the line G, we obtain for the indication of a pressure of the left foot an interval of the same kind, in which are marked cross-lines, or which is tinted gray, in order to avoid all confusion with the preceding tracing. [Illustration: FIG. 117.--TRACING OF THE RUNNING OF A MAN (AFTER PROFESSOR MAREY.) D, Pressures and elevations of the right foot; G, pressures and elevations of the left foot.] This notation can, with sufficient exactitude, be compared to that which is employed in the musical scale. The horizontal lines 1 and 2 represent the _compass_. We there also see _notes_; these are the bars indicating the pressure, of which the value--that is to say, the duration--is represented by the length of these bars. It is the same with regard to the intervals of _silence_: these are expressed by the intervals which separate the pressures, and correspond to the moments in which, during certain paces, such as running, the body is raised from the ground. Besides, we see intervals of this kind on the notation reproduced (Fig. 118) relative to the running of man. [Illustration: FIG. 118.] [Illustration: FIG. 119.] In order to make the signification of these tracings still better understood, we reproduce four varieties of them (Fig. 119). The first notation is that of ordinary walking. The pressures succeed each other regularly. The second shows what takes place during the ascent of a staircase. At a certain moment, the weight of the body is upon both feet at the same time, one of them not quitting the lower step, until the other is already in contact with the step above. Accordingly, there is thus produced an overriding of the pressures. The third is relative to running, and has already been represented in Fig. 118. The pressures of the feet are separated by the times of suspension. The fourth also represents running, but in this case more rapid and characterized by the shorter pressures, the slightly longer periods of suspension intervals, and the quicker succession of movements. Before putting aside the indications relating to the walking movements of man--indications which it was necessary to give in order to render intelligible those which are connected with the paces of the horse--we have yet to fix the value of that which we call 'a step.' It is generally admitted that a step is constituted by the series of movements which are produced between the corresponding phases of the action of one foot and that of the other--for example, between the moment at which the right foot commences its pressure on the ground and that at which the left foot commences its own. It is necessary to adopt here another method of looking at it, and to regard the preceding as being but a _half-step_. The step should then be defined as being constituted by the series of movements which are executed between two similar positions of the same foot--as, for example, between the commencement of a pressure of the right foot and the similar phase of the following pressure of the same foot. We shall soon understand the importance of this definition. Before entering on the details of the paces of the horse, it is necessary to see how the limbs of the latter oscillate during the period of a complete step; or, which is the same thing, to determine what the displacements are which a limb executes between two similar positions of its foot. If we examine one of the limbs during a forward movement of the animal, we see that this limb passes through two principal phases: (1) It is raised from the ground; (2) it resumes contact with the ground. Each of these phases is divided into three periods of time, which we proceed to analyze in connection with the anterior limb. [Illustration: FIG. 120.--SWING OF THE RAISED ANTERIOR LIMB (AFTER G. COLIN).[71] C, Lifting; B, suspension; A, placing.] [71] G. Colin, 'TraitÃ© de Physiologie ComparÃ©e des Animaux,' third edition, Paris, 1886. The foot quits the ground (Fig. 120, C); this may be called _lifting_; the limb is oblique in direction downwards and backwards. This same limb is flexed and carried forward (Fig. 120, B), and, as it is supported by the action of its flexors, this is the period named _suspension_; the hoof is vertical. Then the limb is carried still further forward, becoming extended (Fig. 120, A); the heel is lowered, and the foot, being oblique, is directed towards the ground; this is the _placing_. Then takes place pressure (Fig. 121). The foot has just been placed on the ground; the limb is oblique in direction downwards and forwards; this we call _commencement of the pressure_ (Fig. 121, A). Then the body, being carried forward, whilst the hoof, D, is fixed on the ground, the limb becomes vertical: this stage is _mid-pressure_ (Fig. 121, B). Finally, the progression of the body continuing, the limb becomes oblique downwards and backwards; it is now at the _termination of pressure_ (Fig. 121, C), and proceeds to lift itself anew if another step is to be made. In conclusion, the inferior extremity of the limb describes, from its elevation to its being placed on the ground, an arc of a circle around its superior extremity (Fig. 121, D); whilst, during the pressure, it is its superior extremity which describes one around its inferior extremity, then fixed on the ground (Fig. 121, D). [Illustration: FIG. 121.--SWING OF THE ANTERIOR LIMB ON THE POINT OF PRESSURE (AFTER G. COLIN). A, Commencement of the pressure; B, centre of the pressure; C, termination of the pressure.] If we simultaneously examine the two fore-limbs, we remark that when one of them begins its pressure the other ends it, and _vice versÃ¢_. As to the hind-limbs, the oscillations are similar to those of the fore ones. In the second half of the pressure--that is, when they are passing from the vertical direction (Fig. 122, A) to extreme obliquity backwards (Fig. 122, C)--the effect of their action is to give propulsion to the body. The fore and hind limbs make the same number of steps, and the steps have the same length. The limbs of any quadruped--but we make special allusion to those of the horse--are divided into groups in the following manner: The anterior pair constitutes the _anterior biped_. The _posterior biped_ is that formed by the posterior limbs. The name of _lateral biped_ serves to designate the whole formed by the two limbs of the same side. The right fore-limb and the right hind-limb form the _right lateral biped_. The two others form the _left lateral biped_. [Illustration: FIG. 122.--POSTERIOR LIMB, GIVING THE IMPULSE (AFTER G. COLIN). A, Commencement of pressure; B, centre of pressure; C, termination of pressure.] A fore-limb and hind-limb belonging to the opposite side form a _diagonal biped_, which also takes the name of the fore-limb which forms a part of it. Thus, _the right diagonal biped_ is formed by the association of the right fore-limb and the left hind one. The _left diagonal biped_ is, consequently, the inverse. It is necessary to remember well these preliminary indications; it is the only means of comprehending with facility that which is about to follow. Let us first return to the grouping of the limbs. The denominations _anterior_ and _posterior bipeds_ render clearly perceptible the comparison which consists in regarding a horse when walking as capable of being represented by two men marching one behind the other, and making the same number of steps. According as they move the legs of the same side at the same time in 'covering the step,' or march in contretemps step, we find reproduced all the rhythms which characterize the different paces of the horse. [Illustration: FIG. 123.--NOTATION OF THE AMBLING GAIT IN THE HORSE (AFTER PROFESSOR MAREY).] Professor Marey has studied these paces by a similar method to that which he adopted for the walking of man, and which we have already described. He employed hollow balls fixed under the hoofs, and a registering apparatus with four styles, each corresponding to one of the limbs. The tracing obtained is rather complicated, since two sets of lines are found marked. But a notation similar to that of which we have spoken can be discovered, and its exact signification should now be determined. For this purpose, we have selected the most simple (see Fig. 123). We there see, placed in two superimposed lines, the pressure markings of the right feet (white bands), and of the left feet (gray bands). On the upper line are found those related to the fore-legs; the lower lines contain those associated with the hind-legs. It is, in brief, the superposition of two notations of the human walking movements. And seeing that, as we have previously pointed out, we may make a comparison between a quadruped and two men placed one behind the other, it is easy to understand the significance of the superimposed notations, if we accustom ourselves to look on them as the notations of two bipeds. To read these notations--that is, to learn to know what occurs at each of the movements of the pace--it is necessary, indeed, to remember that they should be examined in vertical sections; it is to each of these sections--of these vertical divisions--that each of the movements which we more particularly wish to analyze corresponds. We proceed to study first the pace of ambling, because it is the most simple; we shall then consider the trot, and, finally, we shall examine that which is the most complicated, viz., the step. [Illustration: FIG. 124.--THE AMBLE: RIGHT LATERAL PRESSURE.[72]] [72] The figures which, in the present study, reproduce the different paces, have been made from our articulated horse (see the note on p. 282). =The Amble.=--To give an exact idea of the general character of the amble, let us fancy the two men whom we discussed above marching one behind the other and walking in step--that is, moving the legs of the same side simultaneously. They will thus represent the amble, which, indeed, results from the alternate displacements of the lateral bipeds; the limbs of the same side (right or left) execute the same movements in the same time. This is what the notation indicates (Fig. 123). We there see that the pressures of the right fore-foot, marked by the white bands in the upper range, are exactly superposed on those of the right hind one, which are marked by a similar band on the lower line; this means that the pressures took place in the same time. We there see also a similar arrangement of the gray bands, which has a similar significance for the left fore and hind feet. And if we recollect the three phases of pressure (see p. 289, and Figs. 121, 122), we shall comprehend, in looking at the diagrams, that, at the initial stage (A), the limbs are commencing their pressure, and are oblique downwards and forwards; that afterwards (B) the two limbs are vertical, since they are at the middle of the pressure stage; and that finally (C) they are oblique downwards and backwards, for it is then the termination of their pressure (Fig. 124). [Illustration: FIG. 125.--NOTATION OF THE GAIT OF THE TROT IN THE HORSE (AFTER PROFESSOR MAREY).] During the time that the right limbs are pressing (notation, white bands) the left limbs are raised; afterwards these latter take up the pressure (gray bands), and then the right limbs are raised in their turn. During the pace of ambling the weight of the body, which is wholly sustained by the limbs of one side only, is not in equilibrium, so that the limbs which are raised return by a brisk movement to the position of support in order to re-establish it. =The Trot.=--We have just seen that, in order to represent the amble, the two marchers moved their right limbs simultaneously, and then their left ones. Let us suppose now that the hinder man anticipated by half a pace the movement of the front one, then will be found realized the association and the nature of the displacements of the limbs during the pace of the trot. By this anticipation of a half-step (we have defined, p. 288, what is to be understood by the word _step_), it follows that when the marcher who is in front advances his right leg it is the left leg of the marcher who follows him that is carried in the same direction. We should thus conclude from this that the trot is characterized by a succession of displacements of the diagonal bipeds. [Illustration: FIG. 126.--THE TROT; RIGHT DIAGONAL PRESSURE.] [Illustration: FIG. 127.--THE TROT; TIME OF SUSPENSION.] Indeed, if we examine the notation of this gait (Fig. 125), we see that with the pressure of the right fore-foot is found associated the pressure of the left hind-foot. It is, accordingly, a typical diagonal biped (Fig. 126). [Illustration: FIG. 128.--NOTATION OF THE PACE OF STEPPING IN THE HORSE (AFTER PROFESSOR MAREY). L, Right lateral pressure; D, right diagonal pressure; LÂ´, left lateral pressure; DÂ´, left diagonal pressure.] But it is necessary to add that these groups of pressures do not succeed one another without interruption, except in the slow trot. In the ordinary trot, or in that in which the animal's strides are very long, the body between each of the double pressures which we have just been considering is projected forward with such force that it remains for an instant separated from the ground. This is what we designate by the name of _time of suspension_ (Fig. 127). The notation in this case would be slightly different from that which we reproduce above, in this sense: that between the diagonal pressures there then would be found an interval, since during the time the body is suspended none of the feet can produce a pressure-mark (see, with regard to these intervals, the notations of the running of a man, Fig. 118, and Fig. 119, 3, 4). =The Walk.=--Although slow, a feature which would seem to make it possible to permit its analysis in a horse when walking, this pace is difficult to comprehend without sufficient preliminary study. [Illustration: FIG. 129.--THE STEP: RIGHT LATERAL PRESSURE.] [Illustration: FIG. 130.--THE STEP: RIGHT DIAGONAL PRESSURE.] We saw above that in order to represent the amble the marchers had to move the legs of the same side simultaneously. We have also just seen that in order to represent the trot the marcher at the back had to anticipate by a half-step. Suppose, now, that this same marcher anticipates the man in front by a quarter-step only, or by a half-pressure period, and thus will be found realized the order of succession of the limbs in the gait or pace called the _walk_. The feet meet the ground one after the other, since they are each in advance by half the duration of a pressure. The strokes are four in number during the period of a step of this pace; in the amble and in the trot they do not exceed two, for then the limbs strike the ground in lateral diagonal pairs. [Illustration: FIG. 131.--THE GALLOP: FIRST PERIOD.] [Illustration: FIG. 132.--THE GALLOP: SECOND PERIOD.] [Illustration: FIG. 133.--THE GALLOP: THIRD PERIOD.] [Illustration: FIG. 134.--THE GALLOP: TIME OF SUSPENSION.] If we examine the notation of the pace of walking (Fig. 128), we see that the right fore-foot commences its pressure when the right hind-foot is in the middle of its own, and that the hinder left begins in the middle of that of the right fore-foot, and that it is itself at the midst of its pressure when the left fore-foot touches the ground, etc. In a word, the foot-fallings occur in the following order and at regular intervals--the fore right foot is here considered as acting first: right fore, left hind, left fore, right hind, and so on in succession. [Illustration: FIG. 135.--NOTATION OF THE GALLOP DIVIDED INTO THREE PERIODS OF TIME (AFTER PROFESSOR MAREY). 1, First period; 2, second period; 3, third period.] As to the nature of the bipeds which succeed one another, it is easy to understand them by means of the notation. In reading this from left to right, we see that the associations of pressure are first made by the two right feet, then by a right foot and a left one, then by two left feet, and, finally, by a left and right. It is, accordingly, a succession this time of lateral and diagonal pressures. [Illustration: FIG. 136.--NOTATION OF THE GALLOP OF FOUR PERIODS IN THE HORSE (AFTER PROFESSOR MAREY). 1, First period; 2, second period; 3, third period; 4, fourth period.] Thus, we find at the start a right lateral pressure (Fig. 129), next a right diagonal (Fig. 130), then a left lateral; finally, a left diagonal pressure. It is thus that the initial letters L, D, LÂ´, DÂ´ further indicate the notations represented in Fig. 128. =The Gallop.=--The ordinary gallop is a pace of three phases. The first is characterized by the fact that one hind-limb alone rests on the ground (Fig. 131); in the second the animal is on a diagonal support (Fig. 132); in the third it comes down on a fore-limb (Fig. 133). The body is then raised (Fig. 134), and to this period of suspension succeed anew the three modes of pressure indicated above. The gallop is said to be from either right or left. In the gallop from the right, the right fore-leg is the more frequently in advance of its neighbour; it is the last to be placed on the ground. The left foot of the posterior biped is the one which commences the action. An entirely opposite arrangement characterizes the gallop from the left. [Illustration: FIG. 137.--LEAP OF THE HARE (AFTER G. COLIN).] The notation reproduced in Fig. 135 corresponds to the gallop from the right. It is there seen, as we pointed out above, that in the first phase the exclusive support of the left hind-foot takes place (1); that afterwards, in the second, commence simultaneously, the pressures of the left fore and the right hind foot (2); this is the left diagonal support; and that finally, in the third, the body comes down on a fore-limb, which is then the right (3); and that for a moment it is on this limb alone that the animal rests. To these three phases on the notation succeeds an interval; this is the period of suspension. The gallop of four phases only differs from the preceding in that the foot-fallings of each diagonal biped occur at slight intervals, and give distinct sounds. The notation is reproduced in Fig. 136. [Illustration: FIG. 138.--THE LEAP.] [Illustration: FIG. 139.--THE LEAP.] [Illustration: FIG. 140.--THE LEAP.] [Illustration: FIG. 141.--THE LEAP.] =The Leap.=--The leap is an act by which the body is wholly raised from the ground and projected upwards and forwards to a greater or less distance. It is prepared for by the flexing of the hind-limbs, which, by being suddenly extended, project the body, and thus enable it to pass over an obstacle. This preparatory arrangement is very remarkable in the leap of the lion, the cat, and the panther, which execute springs of great length; in the horse, in which the leap is not an habitual mode of progression, this flexion of the hinder limbs is less marked. With this animal the leap is generally associated with the gallop; nevertheless, it is sometimes made from a stationary position. In observing the hare or the rabbit, in which the leap is habitual, we notice (Fig. 137) that the hind-limbs, being extremely flexed, rest on the ground as far as the calcaneum, are then straightened by the action of their extensors, become vertical and then oblique backwards at the moment the body is thrown forward into space by the sudden extension of these limbs. The action of the extensors is energetic and instantaneous, and their energy is greater than in ordinary progression, for it is required to lift the body and to project it forcibly a more or less considerable distance. It is the extreme rapidity of this action which enables the animal to clear an obstacle, for without this condition the body would be raised, but not separated from the ground. First of all, in reaching the obstacle to be cleared, the horse prepares to leap by taking the attitude of rearing; the hind-limbs are flexed and carried under the body, the fore-quarters are raised, and the different segments of the fore-limbs are flexed (Fig. 138). [Illustration: FIG. 142.--THE LEAP.] [Illustration: FIG. 143.--THE LEAP.] One sudden trigger action produced by the violent contraction of the extensors of the hind-legs then takes place, and the animal is projected forwards, while he flexes the fore-legs more and more (Fig. 139). He has then risen above the obstacle (Fig. 140). Then while he makes the downward and forward balancing movement, and points his fore-limbs in the same direction, he flexes the hind ones (Fig. 141). Whilst the latter are further flexed, in order to pass the obstacle in their turn, the fore-limbs which are extended come into contact with the ground (Fig. 142). Finally, in the last phase of the leap, the animal, raising himself in front, after the impact of his hind-feet has taken place (Fig. 143), prepares to continue the pace at which he progressed before meeting the obstacle which he had to clear.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

WHAT BIRD IS THAT? A POCKET MUSEUM OF THE LAND BIRDS OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES ARRANGED ACCORDING TO SEASON BY FRANK M. CHAPMAN CURATOR OF BIRDS IN THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AND EDITOR OF ""BIRD-LORE"" [Illustration] WITH 301 BIRDS IN COLOR BY EDMUND J. SAWYER D. APPLETON-CENTURY COMPANY INCORPORATED NEW YORK LONDON COPYRIGHT, 1920, BY D. APPLETON & COMPANY _All rights reserved. This book, or parts thereof, must not be reproduced in any form without permission of the publishers._ PRINTED IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA INTRODUCTION AS Curator of the Department of Birds of the American Museum of Natural History I have had exceptional facilities for the arrangement of collections designed to give students a comprehensive view of local bird-life without confusing them with unnecessary details. Among other aids to this end a collection of 'Birds Found within 50 Miles of New York' has been placed in a special hall and so grouped that the visitor who wishes to identify some bird seen within these limits may do so with the least possible difficulty. In addition to the 'General Systematic Collection,' containing specimens of the 350-odd species of birds which have been recorded from the New York City region, there is also a 'Seasonal Collection.' This Seasonal Collection contains only the birds of the month. Its base is the 'Permanent Resident Birds,' or those which, like the Crow, are with us throughout the year. To these, the migratory species are added or subtracted, as they come or go. The collection of migratory species is therefore revised the first of each month. Birds which are due to arrive during the month are added, those which have left us are withdrawn. The Seasonal Collection thus gives us, at a glance, a picture of the bird-life of the month and correspondingly limits the field of our inquiry when we go to it to learn the name of some strange bird recently observed. In January, therefore, we have not to consider the birds of June, nor need we be concerned with winter birds in summer. The season of occurrence thus gives us an important clue to a bird's identity. For somewhat more than a quarter of a century this small collection has achieved its object so effectively that I have attempted to embody the idea it demonstrates in a series of drawings which have been admirably executed by Mr. Edmund Sawyer. As foundation plates or 'collections,' we have first two 'cases' of the winter land birds of the Northeastern States, or from about Maryland northward, containing the Permanent Residents, which form part of the bird-life of every month of the year, and the Winter Visitants, or those birds which come from the North in the fall to remain with us until the following spring. Cases 3 and 4 contain the Permanent Resident and Winter Visitant land birds of the Southern States. Whether the student is in the North or in the South he has, therefore, a 'collection' of the land birds which he may expect to find during the winter months. Cases 5 to 8 contain the migrants arranged according to the order of their arrival from the South in the vicinity of New York City. Since it is not practicable to have cases containing collections of migrants for other latitudes, data are given showing what changes in dates should be made to adapt the schedule presented to other localities, including Washington, D.C., Ossining, N.Y., Cambridge, Mass., northern Ohio, Glen Ellyn, near Chicago, and southeastern Minnesota. The records for these localities are quoted from the author's 'Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America' to which they were contributed respectively by Dr. C.W. Richmond, Dr. A.K. Fisher, William Brewster, Lynds Jones, B.T. Gault, and Dr. Thos. S. Roberts. With these facts, the cases in a large measure tell their own story, just as does our Museum Seasonal Collection; but further to assist the student I have added what may be termed a 'label' for each of the 'specimens' they contain. These labels include comments on each bird's distinctive characters, a statement of its nesting and winter range, the notes on its status at various localities, to which I have just referred, and brief remarks on its habits. It is the specimens, however, not the labels, which warrant the publication of this little volume, for I hope that, like their prototypes in the American Museum, they will be a means of acquainting us with ""the most eloquent expressions of Nature's beauty, joy and freedom,"" and thereby add to our lives a resource of incalculable value. While the birds in the cases are small, they are drawn and reproduced with such accuracy that no essential detail of color or form is lost. Above all, they have the rare merit of being all drawn to nearly the same scale. One will soon learn therefore to measure the proportions of unknown birds by comparison with those with which one is familiar, and since relative size is the most obvious character in naming birds in nature, this is a feature of the first importance. The student is strongly urged _first_, to become thoroughly familiar with the 'map' of a bird given in the frontispiece: _second_, to use an opera- or field-glass when observing birds: _third_, to write descriptions of unknown birds _while they are in view_ stating their length, shape, and as many details of their color and markings as can be seen: _fourth_, to remember that one is not likely to find birds except in their regular seasons: and, _fifth_, to take this book afield with him and make direct comparison of the living bird with its colored figure. The wide margins are designed for use in recording field-notes. FRANK M. CHAPMAN. American Museum of Natural History. New York City.

The Song Sparrow sings ""Spring, spring, spring, sunny days are here""; the Meadowlark blows his fife, the Downy rattles his drum, and company after company of Grackles in glistening black coats, and of Red-wings with scarlet epaulets, go trooping by. For the succeeding three months, in orderly array, the feathered army files by, each member of it at his appointed time whether he comes from the adjoining State or from below the equator. Besides the Blackbirds, March brings the Robin and Bluebird, Woodcock, Phoebe, Meadowlark, Cowbird, Kingfisher, Mourning Dove, Fox, Swamp, White-throated and Field Sparrows. Near New York City the New Year of the birds has now passed its infancy and in April each day adds perceptibly to its strength. 'Pussy' willows ""creep out along each bough,"" skunk cabbage rears its head in low, wet woods, and in sun-warmed places early wild flowers peep from beneath the sodden leaves. With swelling ranks the migratory army moves more steadily northward. Species which arrived late in March become more numerous, and to them are soon added the Vesper, Savannah, and Chipping Sparrows, and other seed-eaters; and when, with increasing warmth, insects appear, the pioneer Phoebe is followed by other insect-eating birds, like the Swallows, Pipit, Hermit Thrush, Myrtle and Palm Warblers, Louisiana Water-thrush and Ruby-crowned Kinglet. The true bird student will now pass every available moment afield, eagerly watching for the return of old friends and more eagerly still for possible new ones. But enjoyment of this yearly miracle should not be left only to the initiated. We need not be ornithologists to be thrilled when the Robin's song in March awakes long silent echoes, or the Thrasher's solo rings loud and clear on an April morning. The Catbird singing from near his last year's home in the thickening shrubbery, the House Wren whose music bubbles over between bustling visits to an oft-used bird-box, the Chimney Swift twittering cheerily from an evening sky, may be heard without even the effort of listening and each one, with a hundred others, brings us a message if we will but accept it. And I make no fanciful statement when I say that it is a message we can ill afford to lose. [Illustration: ""RED-WINGS WITH SCARLET EPAULETS GO TROOPING BY""] With May come the Thrushes--Wood Thrush, Veery, Olive-back and Gray-cheek, the last two en route to the north--the Orioles, Cuckoos, Vireos, and the Bobolink who began his four thousand mile journey from northern Argentina in March. But May is preÃ«minently the Month of Warblers, ""most beautiful, most abundant, and least known"" of our birds. To the eight species which have already arrived, there may be added over twenty more, represented by a number of individuals beyond our power to estimate. We may hear the Robin, Thrasher, and Wren, without listening, but we will see few Warblers without looking; and this, in a measure, accounts for the fascination which attends their study. After May 15 there is an evident thinning in the ranks of the migrating army, and by June 1 we shall see only a few stragglers. The Transient Visitors will have gone to their more northern homes and our bird population will then consist only of the ever present Permanent Residents and the Summer Residents which the great northward march of the birds has brought us from the South. Although June may be called the Month of Nests, nest-building begins long before the migration ends. Some Owls and Hawks lay in March, and the Bluebird, White-breasted Nuthatch and Robin have eggs by April 20, while most of our birds go to housekeeping during the latter half of May. Nevertheless, it is in June that their domestic life is at its height; and to the student of birds' habits this is by far the most interesting month in the year. [Illustration: TREE SWALLOWS . . . RESTING IN ROWS ON WAYSIDE WIRES] Birds that raise two or even three broods will still be occupied with household affairs in July, but one-brooded birds, having launched their families, will seek retirement to undergo the trying ordeal of molt, whereby they will get a complete new costume. Often this will be quite unlike the one in which they arrived from the South--as the student will discover, sometimes to his confusion! In August, the Month of Molt, the seclusion sought by many of our summer birds induces the belief that they have left us, but toward the latter part of the month they reappear. The first week in August virtually marks the end of the song season. The Wood Pewee and Red-eyed Vireo remain in voice throughout the month, but the great chorus which has made May, June and most of July vocal, we shall not hear before another spring--so short is the time when we are blessed by the songs of birds. Meanwhile the feathered army has begun its retreat to winter quarters. As early as July 15, Tree Swallows will arrive and by the end of the month will be seen resting in rows on wayside telegraph wires, or en route to their roosts in the marshes. In the now heavily leaved forests the returning Warblers and Flycatchers will not be so easily observed as they were in May, but in September they become too abundant to be overlooked. The southward movement grows in strength until late September, when the greater part of the insect-eating birds have left us, and it is terminated by the frosts, and consequent falling leaves, of October. But just as in the spring some of the northbound migrants drop from the ranks to spend the summer with us, so in the fall some of the southbound travelers will remain with us for the winter. The Junco, which we are wont to think of as only a winter bird, arrives the latter part of September to remain until April, and with him come the Golden-crowned Kinglet, Brown Creeper and Winter Wren--all to stay until spring. October will bring the Horned Lark, Pine Finch, Snow Bunting, Tree Sparrow and Northern Shrike and these birds with the ones just mentioned, and the ever faithful Permanent Residents, give us a goodly winter company. But the possibilities do not end here; there may be Redpolls, American and also White-winged Crossbills, perhaps Pine Grosbeaks, and, best of all, Evening Grosbeaks, who of recent years have been coming to us more or less regularly from no man knows where. So from one year's end to the other, there is not a month, a week or day which has not interests of its own. The bird student may pass his life in one place, but he can never say ""I have finished"" for the morrow may bring some new bird or new fact. How immeasurably this association with the birds adds to the joy of life! What new meanings their comings and goings give to the changing seasons; the very air is made eloquent by their calls and songs. Why should we not all ""come at these enchantments""?

Accidental Visitant. A bird found beyond the limits of its usual range. L. Length of a bird from the tip of its bill to the end of its tail. Remember that living birds look shorter than the measurements of specimens given beyond. P.R. Permanent Resident. A species which is found in the same locality throughout the year. The Bob-white, Ruffed Grouse, most Owls, and Hawks, the Crow, Jays, Black-capped Chickadee and the White-breasted Nuthatch are Permanent Residents. S.R. Summer Resident. A species which comes from the South in the spring and, after nesting, returns to its winter quarters. T.V. Transient Visitant. A species which visits us in the spring while en route to its more northern nesting grounds, and in the fall when returning to its winter home in the South. Most Transient Visitants are found both in the spring and fall, but some, like the Connecticut Warbler, are found in the North Atlantic States only in the fall. W.V. Winter Visitant. A species which comes from the North to remain with us all, or part of the winter and then return to the North. Winter Visitants may arrive in September and remain until April, or they may come later and only for a brief stay. * * * * * NOTE. Measurements are in inches. Land Birds of the Eastern United States GALLINACEOUS BIRDS. ORDER GALLINÃ AMERICAN QUAIL. FAMILY ODONTOPHORIDÃ BOB-WHITE _Colinus virginianus virginianus. Case 1. Figs. 1, 2_ The black and white markings of the male are respectively buff and brown in the female. In flight the Bob-white, or Quail, suggests a Meadowlark, but the tail is without white feathers. L. 10. _Range._ Eastern United States north to Minnesota and Maine south to the Gulf. A Permanent Resident. Severe winters and much shooting have made it rare in the more northern parts of its range. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, P.R. N. Ohio, not common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. Except when nesting Bob-whites live in flocks or ""coveys"" usually composed of the members of one family. Their song, heard in spring and summer, is the clear, ringing two- or three-noted whistle which gives them their common name. Their fall and winter notes, which sportsmen term ""scatter calls"" are signals by which the members of a flock keep within speaking distance of one another. ""_Where_ are you?"" ""_Where_ are you?"" they seem to say. As with other protectively colored, ground-inhabiting birds, Bob-whites do not take wing until one almost steps upon them. Then, like a bursting bomb, the covey seems to explode, its brown pieces flying in every direction. The nest is on the ground and the 10-18 white, pear-shaped eggs are laid in May or June. The Florida Bob-white (_C. v. floridanus_, Case 3, Figs. 1, 2), a smaller darker race is resident in Florida, except in the northern part of the state. It begins to nest in April. GROUSE. FAMILY TETRAONIDÃ CANADA SPRUCE PARTRIDGE _Canachites canadensis canace_ The male is a grayish bird with a jet black throat and breast, the former bordered with white; the skin above the eye is red. The female is barred with black and reddish brown with a black mottled tail tipped with brown. L. 15. _Range._ Northern parts of United States from New Brunswick to Manitoba. Other races are found throughout the wooded parts of Canada and Alaska. An unsuspicious inhabitant of swampy coniferous forests. Now rare in the United States. It nests on the ground in June, laying 9-16 eggs, buff, lightly speckled with brown. RUFFED GROUSE _Bonasa umbellus umbellus. Case 1, Fig. 3_ The female resembles the male in color but has the black neck-tufts smaller. The tail-feathers vary from gray to bright rusty. L. 17. _Range._ Eastern United States south in the Alleghanies to Georgia. In the southern states the Grouse is often called 'Pheasant.' A Permanent Resident. Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, P.R., formerly very common. N. Ohio, rare P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare and local P.R. On our western plains and prairies there is a Grouse which we call Prairie Hen and we might well apply the name Wood Hen to this Grouse of our forests. To flush a Grouse in the quiet of the woods always makes the ""heart jump."" His whirring wings not only produce the roar which accompanies his flight, but they are also responsible for the ""drumming"" which constitutes the Grouse's song as sitting upright on some favorite log, he rapidly beats the air with his wings. The horny fringes which in winter border the toes of the Grouse, or Partridge, as he is also called, form in effect snow-shoes which help to support the bird on soft snow. At this season they also feed in trees on buds and catkins, and they may roost in trees or seek a bed by plunging into a snow-bank. The nest, lined with leaves, is placed at the base of a tree or stump; the 8-14 buffy eggs are laid in May. The Canada Ruffed Grouse (_B. u. togata_), of northern New England and northwards is grayer above and more distinctly barred below. PRAIRIE CHICKEN _Tympanuchus americanus_ The Prairie Hen has a rounded or nearly square tail and a barred breast; in the Sharp-tailed Grouse the tail is pointed, the breast with V-shaped markings. L. 18. _Range._ Central Plains region from Texas to Manitoba, east to Indiana. Migratory at its northern limits. Glen Ellyn, P.R. local, S.E. Minn., P.R. much decreased in numbers. The Ruffed Grouse sounds his rolling, muffled drum-call in the seclusion of the forest, but the Prairie Hen beats his loud _boom-ah-boom_ in the open freedom of the plains. Hardy and strong of wing, he can cope with winter storms and natural enemies, but against the combined assault of man, dog, and gun, he cannot successfully contend. About a dozen buff-olive eggs are laid on the ground in April or early May. HEATH HEN _Tympanuchus cupido_ This is a close relative of the Prairie Hen, having the black neck-tuft of less than ten feathers with pointed, not rounded, ends. It is now found only on the Island of Martha's Vineyard, but formerly inhabited plains or barrens, locally, from New Jersey to Massachusetts. It nests in June. TURKEYS. FAMILY MELEAGRIDÃ WILD TURKEY _Meleagris gallopavo silvestris_ The Wild Turkey was formerly found as far north as Maine and Ontario but it is unknown now north of central Pennsylvania. South of Maryland it is not uncommon locally. _Range._ Kansas and central Pennsylvania to the Gulf coast, and northern Florida. Non-migratory. Washington, rare P.R. Our domestic Turkey is descended from the Mexican Wild Turkey and like that race has the upper tail-coverts and tail tipped with whitish, whereas in our eastern Wild Turkey these tips are chestnut. The nest is on the ground and 10-14 eggs, pale cream-color finely speckled with brownish, are laid in April. The Florida Wild Turkey (_M. g. osceola_), of southern Florida, is smaller and the white bars on the primaries are narrower and more broken. PIGEONS AND DOVES. ORDER COLUMBÃ PIGEONS AND DOVES. FAMILY COLUMBIDÃ MOURNING DOVE _Zenaidura macroura carolinensis. Case 3, Fig. 3; Case 5, Fig. 11_ Except the southern little Ground Dove, this is our only Dove. Its long, pointed tail and the swift, darting flight are its field characters. It is often mistaken for the Wild or Passenger Pigeon, now extinct. The two birds differ in size and in color, but size is a matter of distance, and color, of comparison, so it seems probable that as long as there is a possibility of seeing a Passenger Pigeon, Mourning Doves will be mistaken for them. L. 11-3/4. The Wild Pigeon is about five inches longer. _Range._ North America. In a railway journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific one may expect to see the Dove daily. Winters from Virginia southward, migrating northward in March. Washington, P.R., common, except in midwinter. Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 3-Nov. 27; a few winter. Cambridge, rather rare T.V., Apl. 8-June 18; Sept. 18-Nov. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 20-Oct. 25; rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common S.R., formerly common, Mch. 12-Oct. 21. S.E. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 15-Dec. 25. Doves are particularly common in the southern states where, ranked as game-birds, they are shot in large numbers. The Wild Pigeon's note was an explosive squawk; the Dove's is a soft, mournful _coo-oo-ah, coo-o-o-coo-o-o-coo-o-o-_. During the winter, Doves are usually found in small flocks but, unlike the Wild Pigeon, they nest in scattered pairs. The nest is in a tree or on the ground. Two white eggs are laid in April. GROUND DOVE _ChÃ¦mepelia passerina terrestris. Case 3, Fig. 4_ The female is duller than the male. L. 6-3/4. _Range._ Tropical and subtemperate parts of the Western Hemisphere. Our form is found in Florida and on the coast region from North Carolina to Texas. Washington, accidental; two records, Sept., Oct. This dainty, miniature Pigeon is common in southern gardens and old fields. It runs gracefully before one, and when flushed rises with a whirring flight but soon alights, usually on the ground. Its call is a crooning _coo_. The nest is placed on the ground and in low trees and bushes. Two white eggs are laid in March. BIRDS OF PREY. ORDER RAPTORES AMERICAN VULTURES. FAMILY CATHARTIDÃ TURKEY VULTURE _Cathartes aura septentrionalis. Case 3, Fig. 9_ Head red, plumage with a brownish cast. Young birds have the head covered with brownish down. L. 30. _Range._ Most of the Western Hemisphere in several subspecies; in the eastern states north to northern New Jersey and, locally, southern New York. Migrating south from the northern part of its range. Washington, abundant P.R. Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, casual, two records. N. Ohio, tolerably common S.R., Mch. 5-Oct. 30. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 27. The 'Turkey Buzzard' has a wider wing-stretch and is a better aviator than the Black Vulture. It is more a bird of the country than the last-named species which is the common Vulture of the streets in many southern cities. Extremely graceful in the air, it is far from pleasing when at rest. The two dull white, brown-marked eggs are laid on the ground under logs, in crevices in rocks, etc., in March in Florida, in April in Virginia. BLACK VULTURE _Catharista urubu urubu. Case 3, Fig. 10_ Head black, plumage without the brownish cast of the Turkey Vulture. _Range._ Eastern U.S., north to Virginia; an abundant Permanent Resident. Washington, casual, Mch., July, Dec. The Vulture of southern cities; a frequenter of slaughter houses and markets. In flight the under surfaces of the wing look silvery. It is by no means so impressive a figure in the air as the Turkey Vulture. Two pale bluish white eggs, generally with brown markings, are laid on the ground under logs, bushes, palmettoes, etc., in March and April. HAWKS, EAGLES, KITES, ETC. FAMILY BUTEONIDÃ SWALLOW-TAILED KITE _Elanoides forficatus forficatus_ The head and lower parts are white, the rest of the plumage glossy black; the tail deeply forked. L. 24. _Range._ Florida to South Carolina, and up the Mississippi Valley rarely to Saskatchewan; winters south of the United States, returning in March. Washington, three records, Aug.; Apl. SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., May 4. Color, form, grace, and power of motion combine to make the flight of the Swallow-tail an impressive demonstration of the bird's mastery of the air. It feeds on lizards and small snakes which it captures when on the wing from the branches of trees. The nest is placed in the upper branches of tall trees, 2-3 eggs heavily marked with brown being laid in Florida in April; in Iowa in June. WHITE-TAILED KITE _Elanus leucurus_ A gray bird with white underparts, rather short white tail and black shoulders. L. 15-1/2. _Range._ Chiefly southwestern United States and southward east to the lower Mississippi Valley. This is a rare bird east of the Mississippi. It frequents open marshy places and feeds upon small snakes, lizards, grasshoppers, etc., which it captures on the ground. The nest is built in trees, and the 3-5 eggs, heavily marked with brown, are laid in May. MISSISSIPPI KITE _Ictinia mississippiensis_ A slaty-blue bird with black tail and wings and red eyes. L. 14. _Range._ Southern United States, north to South Carolina, and southern Indiana; winters chiefly south of the United States and returns in April. A low-flying hunter of insects, snakes and frogs. It migrates in loose flocks sometimes near the earth, at others far above it. The nest is placed in tall trees. The eggs are laid in May; they number 1-3, and are dull white, occasionally with a bluish tinge. EVERGLADE KITE _Rostrhamus sociabilis_ A dark slate-colored bird with a white rump and a rather slender hooked bill. The young are quite different; black above, tipped with reddish brown, below mottled and barred with black, reddish brown and buff, but with the white rump-patch of the adult. L. 18. _Range._ Tropical America north to southern Florida. The Everglade Kite is found in marshes and about lakes and ponds hunting for its favorite food of large snails, which it extracts from their shells by means of its hooked bill. It is rarely seen north of southern Florida. The nest is placed in bushes or among reeds. The 2-3 eggs, which are heavily marked with brown, are laid in March. MARSH HAWK _Circus hudsonius. Case 3, Fig. 15_ The immature bird and adult female are dark brown above, reddish brown below, but, in any plumage, the species may be known by the white upper tail-coverts which show clearly in flight. L., male, 19; female, 22. _Range._ North America, wintering from New Jersey southward; migrates northward in March. Washington, common W.V., July-Apl. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Mch. 6-Oct. 30; a few winter. Cambridge, common T.V., Mch. 20-Nov. 10, one breeding record. N. Ohio, not common S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 30. Glen Ellyn, S.R., several pairs, Apl. 4-Nov. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 6-Nov. 1. The Marsh Hawk quarters low over the fields turning sharply here and there to follow the course of a meadow mouse in the grass forest below. As a rule the bird is silent but in the mating season he repeats a 'screeching' note. The nest is made on the ground in the marshes; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in May. SHARP-SHINNED HAWK _Accipiter velox. Case 1, Figs. 11, 12; Case 3, Figs. 7, 8_ The sexes differ only in size, the female being much the larger. There is a marked difference in color between adult and immature birds, the latter being more commonly seen. L. male, 11-1/4; female, 13-1/2. _Range._ North America; wintering from Massachusetts southward. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, common T.V., Apl. 3-May 11; Sept. 5-Oct. 25; rare S.R., uncommon W.V. N. Ohio, not common P.R., a few winter. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., Mch. 19-Dec. 9. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 28-Dec 28. This small, bird-killing Hawk dashes recklessly after its victims, following them through thick cover. It is less often seen in the open than the Sparrow Hawk, which it resembles in size, but from which it may be known by its different color, longer tail, and much shorter wings. It nests in trees 15-40 feet from the ground. The eggs, 3-6 in number, are bluish white or cream, marked with brown and are laid in May. [Illustration: SHARP-SHINNED HAWK. Note the Long Tail.] COOPER'S HAWK _Accipiter cooperi. Case 1, Figs. 9, 10_ A large edition of the Sharp-shinned Hawk, with the tail more rounded, the adult with a darker crown. L. male, 15-1/2; female, 19. _Range._ Nests throughout United States; winters from southern New England southward. Washington, common S.R., less common W.V. Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, common T.V., not uncommon S.R., rare W.V., Apl. 10-Oct. 20. N. Ohio, not common, Mch. 20-Nov. 1; a few winter. Glen Ellyn, local S.R., a few winter. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 3. This is the real 'Chicken Hawk,' but it is less often seen and heard than the soaring, screaming Buteos to which the name is usually applied. It resembles the Sharp-shinned in habits but being larger may prey on larger birds. The female may be easily distinguished from the Sharp-shinned by her larger size, but the male is not appreciably larger than a female Sharp-shin. The nest is built in a tree 25-50 feet up. The bluish white, rarely spotted eggs are laid in late April or early May. GOSHAWK _Astur atricapillus_ The adult is blue-gray above with a darker crown and a white line over the eye. The underparts are finely and beautifully marked with gray and white. Young birds resemble the young of Cooper's Hawk, but are much larger. L., male, 22; female, 24. _Range._ North America, nests chiefly north of the United States and winters southward, usually rarely, as far as Virginia. Washington, casual in winter. Ossining, rare W.V., Oct. 10-Jan. 14. Cambridge, irregular and uncommon W.V. SE. Minn., W.R., Nov. 5-Apl. 4. Like its smaller relatives the Sharp-shin and Cooper's Hawks, this powerful raptor is a relentless hunter of birds. It is particularly destructive to Ruffed Grouse. Fortunately it does not often visit us in numbers. It nests in trees, laying 2-5 white eggs, rarely marked with brownish, in April. RED-TAILED HAWK _Buteo borealis borealis. Case 1, Figs. 5, 6; Case 3, Fig. 13._ This, the largest of our common Hawks, is a heavy-bodied bird with wings which when closed, reach nearly to the end of the tail. The adult has the tail bright reddish brown with a narrow black band near the tip. The immature bird has the tail rather inconspicuously barred with blackish, and a broken band of blackish spots across the underparts. L. male, 20; female, 23. _Range._ Eastern North America, migrating only at the northern limit of its range. There are several races, Krider's Red-tail, a paler form inhabiting the great Plains, and Harlan's Hawk, a darker form with a mottled tail, the lower Mississippi Valley. Washington, common W.V., rare S.R. Ossining, common P.R., less common in winter. Cambridge, rare T.V., locally W.V., Oct. 10-Apl. 20. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, P.R., not common, chiefly T.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 2. The Red-tail resembles the Red-shoulder in general habits, but it is more a bird of the fields, where it may be seen perched on the limb of a dead tree or similar exposed situation. Its note, a long-drawn, squealing whistle, is quite unlike that of the Red-shoulder. The Red-tail feeds chiefly on mice and other small mammals. With the Red-shoulder it is often called 'Chicken Hawk,' but does not deserve the name. It nests in trees 30-70 feet up and in April lays 2-4 eggs, dull white sparingly marked with brown. RED-SHOULDERED HAWK _Buteo lineatus lineatus. Case 1, Fig. 4; Case 3 Fig. 12_ [Illustration: RED-SHOULDERED HAWK. ADULT. Note the Barred Tail.] Seen from below the reddish brown underparts and black and white barred tail will identify adults of this species. Immature birds are streaked below with blackish; the tail is dark grayish brown indistinctly barred, but the shoulder is always rusty, though this is not a marking one can see in life. L., male. 18-1/2; female, 20-1/4. _Range._ Eastern North America from northern Florida to Canada; resident except in the northern part of its range. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, common, Apl.-Nov., less common in winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, P.R., more common than the Red-tail; chiefly T.V. A medium-sized, heavy-bodied Hawk with wings which, when closed, reach well toward the tip of the tail. It lives both in the woods and open places, and may be flushed from the border of a brook or seen soaring high in the air. Its note, frequently uttered, as it swings in wide circles, is a distinctive _KÃ¨e-you, KÃ¨e-you_, quite unlike the call of any of our other Hawks. It is often well imitated by the Blue Jay. The Red-shoulder feeds chiefly on mice and frogs. It nests in trees 30-60 feet up and, in April, lays 3-5 eggs, white marked with brown. The Florida Red-shouldered Hawk (_Buteo lineatus alleni_), a smaller form with grayer head and paler underparts, is a resident in Florida and along the coast from South Carolina to Mexico. It nests in February. BROAD-WINGED HAWK _Buteo platypterus_ With a general resemblance to the Red-shouldered Hawk, but smaller; no red on the bend of the wing, or rusty in the primaries, only the outer three of which are 'notched.' L., male, 15-3/4; female, 16-3/4. _Range._ Eastern North America. Breeding from the Gulf States to the St. Lawrence; winters from Ohio and Delaware to S.A.; migrates northward in March. Washington, uncommon P.R. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Mch. 15-Oct. 23. Cambridge, uncommon T.V. in early fall, rare in spring and summer; Apl. 25-Sept. 30. N. Ohio, not common P.R. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 4. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 11. A rather retiring, unwary Hawk which nests in thick woods and is less often seen in the open than the Red-shoulder, but, when migrating, hundreds pass high in the air, with other Hawks. Its call is a high, thin, penetrating whistle. It nests in late April and early May, laying 2-4 whitish eggs marked with brown. ROUGH-LEGGED HAWK _Archibuteo lagopus sancti-johannis_ Legs feathered to the toes; basal half of tail white; belly black. Some individuals are wholly black. L., male, 21; female, 23. _Range._ Breeds in northern Canada; usually rare and irregular in the northern U.S., from November to April. Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining, casual. Cambridge, T.V., not common, Nov.-Dec.; Mch.-Apl. N. Ohio, not common W.V., Nov. 20-Apl. 3. Glen Ellyn, quite common W.V., Oct. 12-Apl. 30. SE. Minn., W.V., Oct. 15-Mch. Frequents fields and marshes, where it hunts to and fro after mice, which form its principal fare. GOLDEN EAGLE _Aquila chrysaetos_ With the Bald Eagle, largest of our raptorial birds; with a general resemblance to the young of that species, in which the head and tail are dark, but with the legs feathered to the toes. L., male, 32-1/2; female, 37-1/2. _Range._ Northern parts of the northern Hemisphere; in the United States, rare east of the Mississippi. Washington, rare W.V., Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, 1 record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE. Minn., P.R. The Golden Eagle is so rare in the eastern United States and its general resemblance to a young Bald Eagle is so close, that only an experienced ornithologist could convince me that he had seen a Golden Eagle east of the Mississippi. BALD EAGLE _HaliÃ¦etus leucocephalus leucocephalus. Case 3, Fig. 11_ When immature the head and tail resemble the body in color, and at this age the bird is sometimes confused with the more western Golden Eagle. The latter has the head browner and the legs feathered to the toes. L., male, 33; female, 35-1/2. _Range._ North America but rare in the interior and in California, migratory at the northern limit of its range. Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, of irregular occurrence at all seasons. N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. SE. Minn., P.R., becoming rare. An adult Bald Eagle will at once be recognized by its white head and tail; the immature birds by their large size. Eagles are usually found near the water where fish may be obtained either on the shore or from the Osprey. The call of the male is a human-like, loud, clear _cac-cac-cac_; that of the female is said to be more harsh and often broken. Eagles nest in tall trees and on cliffs, and lay two or three dull white eggs, in Florida, in November and December; in Maine, in April. FALCONS, CARACARAS, ETC. FAMILY FALCONIDÃ GYRFALCON _Falco rusticolus gyrfalco_ A large Hawk with long, pointed wings, the upper parts brown with numerous narrow, buffy bars or margins, the tail evenly barred with grayish and blackish, the underparts white lightly streaked with black. L. 22. _Range._ Arctic regions; south in winter rarely to New York and Minnesota. The Gray Gyrfalcon (_F. r. rusticolus_) a paler form, with a streaked crown, the Black Gyrfalcon (_F. r. obsoletus_) a slate-colored race, and the White Gyrfalcon (_F. islandus_) are also rare winter visitants to the northern United States. These great Falcons are so rare in the United States that unless they are seen by an experienced observer, under exceptionally favorable conditions, authentic records of their visits can be based only on the actual capture of specimens. DUCK HAWK _Falco peregrinus anatum_ The adult is slaty blue above; buff below marked with black, and with black cheek-patches. Immature birds are blackish above margined with rusty, below deep rusty buff streaked with blackish. L., male, 16; female, 19. _Range._ Northern Hemisphere, breeding south locally to New Jersey and in Alleghanies to South Carolina; winters from New Jersey southward. Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining, casual. Cambridge, rare T.V., casual in winter, SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., Apl. 4. As the Peregrine of falconry we know of the Duck Hawk as a fearless, dashing hunter of greater power of wing and talon. It nests in rocky cliffs in April and from its eyrie darts upon passing Pigeons and other birds. It is most often seen following the coast-line during migrations where it takes toll of Ducks and shore-birds. Three to four heavily marked, brownish eggs are laid in April. PIGEON HAWK _Falco columbarius_ A small Hawk, about the size of a Sparrow Hawk. The adult is slaty blue above, with a rusty collar and a barred, white-tipped tail; below buff, streaked with blackish. Young birds have the upperparts blackish brown. L. 11. _Range._ Breeds north of, and winters chiefly south of the United States. Migrates northward in April and May, and southward in September and October. Washington, not uncommon T.V. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 1-May 11; Aug. 10-Oct. 15. Cambridge, common T.V., Apl. 25-May 5; Sept. 25-Oct. 20; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, rare P.R. Glen Ellyn, regular but rare T.V., Apl. 26-May 5; Sept. 1-Oct. 16. SE. Minn., Apl. 13. We know this Hawk as a not common migrant generally seen in open places and along the shores. It feeds chiefly on small birds. SPARROW HAWK _Falco sparverius sparverius. Case 1, Figs. 7, 8; Case 3, Figs. 5, 6_ The male has the tail with only one bar; the breast unmarked; the abdomen with black spots; while the female has the tail with several bars, the underparts streaked with brownish. In both sexes the bright reddish brown of the upperparts, black markings about the head, and small size are gold field characters. L. 10. _Range._ Sparrow Hawks are found throughout the greater part of the Western Hemisphere. Our eastern race inhabits the region east of the Rockies and is migratory at the northern limit of its range. Southern Florida specimens are slightly smaller and darker and are known as the Florida Sparrow Hawk (_F. s. paulus_). [Illustration: SPARROW HAWK HOVERING ABOVE ITS PREY.] Washington, common W.V., rare S.R. Ossining, rather rare P.R. Cambridge, P.R., common in summer, rare in winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rather rare S.R., Mch. 10-Oct. 26. The Sparrow Hawk is one of our commonest and most familiar Hawks. He is a handsome little Falcon, and though his prey is chiefly humble grasshoppers, he captures them in a sportsmanlike manner by ""waiting on"" or hovering on rapidly beating wings over his game and dropping on it with deadly aim. His call is a high, rapidly repeated _Killy-killy-killy_. The three to seven eggs, finely marked with reddish brown, are laid in a hollow limb or similar situation in April. AUDUBON'S CARACARA _Polyborus cheriway cheriway_ A falcon-like Vulture with a bare face, black cap, white throat, breast and nape; the rest of the plumage is black, the tail barred with white. L. 22. _Range._ Mexican border and southward; south central Florida. In the eastern United States the Caracara is found only in the Kissimmee prairie region of southern Florida where its presence, so far from others of its kind, furnishes one of the problems in distribution which stimulate the imagination of the faunal naturalist. OSPREYS. FAMILY PANDIONIDÃ OSPREY _Pandion haliÃ¦tus carolinensis. Case 3, Fig. 14_ The Osprey or Fish Hawk is often miscalled 'Eagle,' but it is a smaller bird with white, instead of blackish underparts. L. 23. _Range._ The Osprey is found throughout the greater part of the world; the American form occurs in both North and South America and winters from the southern United States southward, starting northward in March. Washington, uncommon S.R., Mch. 19-Nov. 30. Ossining, common T.V., rare S.R., Apl. 3-May 26; Sept. 29-Oct. 20. Cambridge, rather common T.V., Apl.-May; Sept.-Oct. N. Ohio, rare S.R., Apl. 20-Oct. Glen Ellyn, two records, May and Sept. The Osprey, or Fish Hawk, feeds on fish and nothing but fish. He is, therefore, never found far from his fishing grounds, where no one who has seen him plunge for his prey and rise with it from the water will doubt his ability to supply his wants. Ospreys usually nest in trees at varying distances from the ground, but sometimes on cliffs or even on the ground itself, and return year after year to the same nest. The Osprey's alarm note is a high, loud, complaining whistle, frequently repeated. The eggs are laid in late April and early May. They are usually four in number, buffy white, heavily marked with chocolate. BARN OWLS. FAMILY ALUCONIDÃ BARN OWL _Aluco pratincola pratincola. Case 3, Fig. 17_ A light-colored Owl, looking almost white in the dusk. L. 18. _Range._ Barn Owls are found throughout the world. Our species is rare north of New Jersey and Ohio. It is migratory only at the northern limit of its range. Washington, not rare P.R. Ossining, A.V. This is the 'Monkey-faced Owl' of towers and steeples. Few who hear its loud, sudden scream or rapidly repeated _crree-crree-crree_ know their author, who may live for years in the heart of a village a stranger to its human inhabitants. The mice, however, have tragic evidence of his presence in the nightly raids he makes upon their ranks. The nest is made in the diurnal retreat, 5-9 white eggs being laid in April. HORNED OWLS, HOOT OWLS, ETC. FAMILY STRIGIDÃ LONG-EARED OWL _Asio wilsonianus. Case 1, Fig. 17_ Distinguished by very long ear-tufts. L. 14-3/4. _Range._ Temperate North America. Winters south to Georgia and Louisiana. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, rare, P.R. but sometimes common in fall and winter. N. Ohio, uncommon P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare, fall records only, Nov. 7-Dec. 14. An Owl of evergreen clumps and dense growths, where its presence is often betrayed by the litter below of undigested pellets of hair and bones which Owls eject at the mouth. It is not a ""hoot"" Owl, and even many ornithologists have not heard its notes, which are described as a ""soft-toned, slow _wu-hunk, wu-hunk_, and a low twittering, whistling _dicky, dicky, dicky_."" It is not a hole-inhabiting Owl and like the Great Horned nests in an old Hawk, Crow, or Squirrel nest. Three to six white eggs are laid in April. SHORT-EARED OWL _Asio flammeus. Case 1, Fig. 18_ The 'ears' are barely evident, the eyes are yellow; underparts streaked. L. 15-1/2. _Range._ Found throughout the greater part of the world; migrating southward at the northern part of its North American range. Washington, common W.V. Ossining, casual. Cambridge, T.V., Mch. 15-Apl. 15, rare; Oct.-Nov., uncommon. N. Ohio, uncommon P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare, Dec. 11-May 15. SE. Minn., common S.R. This is a marsh Owl and we are therefore not likely to find it associated with other members of its family. Its notes are said to resemble the _ki-yi_ of a small dog. Four to seven white eggs are laid in an open nest in the grasses in April. BARRED OWL _Strix varia varia. Case 1, Fig. 15_ A large Owl with black eyes (the figure is incorrect) and no 'ears.' L. 20. _Range._ Eastern North America. Generally a Permanent Resident. The Florida Barred Owl (_S. v. alleni_, Case 3, Fig. 16), is somewhat darker than the northern form and has nearly naked toes. It inhabits Florida and the coast region from South Carolina to Texas. Washington, not common, rare P.R. Ossining, rare P.R. Cambridge, P.R., sometimes common in Nov. and Dec. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare and local P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. An Owl of the woods, common in the less thickly settled parts of its range. Its loud, sonorous notes, _whoo, whoo-whoo who-whoo, to-whoo-ah_, are often uttered. When two birds come together their united calls produce some of the most startling sounds to be heard in nature. The Barred Owl feeds chiefly on mice. It nests in hollow trees in March, laying 2-4 white eggs. GREAT GRAY OWL _Scotiaplex nebulosa nebulosa_ Largest of American Owls, with a general resemblance to the Barred Owl, but nearly a third larger and with yellow eyes. L. 27. _Range._ Northern North America, rarely straggling to United States in winter. Cambridge, very rare and irregular W.V. SE. Minn., rare W.V. RICHARDSON'S OWL _Cryptoglaux funerea richardsoni_ A small Owl about the size of a Screech Owl, but without ear-tufts. It is grayish brown above and both head and back are spotted with black; the underparts are white heavily streaked with grayish brown. _Range._ Northern Canada and Alaska, rarely visiting the eastern United States in winter. We are not likely to meet this Owl. Cambridge, very rare W.V. SAW-WHET OWL _Cryptoglaux acadica acadica. Case 2, Fig. 41_ Smallest of our Owls; eyes yellow, no ear-tufts. L. 8. _Range._ Nests in the northern United States and northward, south in the Alleghanies to Maryland; winters rather rarely and irregularly southward to Virginia. Washington, rare W.V., Oct.-Mch. Ossining, rather rare W.V., Oct. 28-Jan. 13. Cambridge, not uncommon, W.V., Nov.-Mch. N. Ohio, rare P.R. SE. Minn., uncommon. P.R. A tame little Owl which sometimes may be caught in one's hand. It passes the day in dense growth, usually evergreens. Its note resembles the ""sound made when a large-tooth saw is being filed."" SCREECH OWL _Otus asio asio. Case 1, Figs. 13, 14_ The two sexes are alike, the two color phases being individual and representing dichromatism. Among animals, gray and black squirrels furnish a similar case. The ear-like feather-tufts give the bird a cat-like appearance, hence the name 'Cat Owl.' The young are downy-looking creatures evenly barred with dusky. L. 9-1/2. _Range._ Screech Owls are found throughout the greater part of the Western Hemisphere. Our eastern form occurs in the eastern United States from Canada southward. The Florida race (_O. a. floridanus_, Case 3, Fig. 19) is smaller and of a darker gray than the northern bird. The 'red' phase is rare. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. This, the smallest of our 'horned' Owls, is also the commonest. It lives near and sometimes in our homes even when they are situated in towns. Its tremulous, wailing whistle (in no sense a 'screech') is therefore one of our most characteristic twilight bird-notes. Mice and insects form the greater part of the Screech Owl's fare. Four to six white eggs are laid in a hollow tree, bird-box, or similar site in April. GREAT HORNED OWL _Bubo virginianus virginianus. Case 1, Fig. 16_ Largest of the 'horned' Owls. L. 22. _Range._ Western Hemisphere in many forms; our form is confined to the eastern United States. A Permanent Resident. Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, uncommon, autumn or winter. N. Ohio, rare P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. The Great Horned Owl retreats before the civilization that destroys the forests in which it lives. In thinly settled regions its deep-toned, monotone, _whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, whooo, whooo_ is still a characteristic bird voice, but most of us hear it only when we camp in the wilderness. The bird's fierce nature has won for it the name of ""tiger among birds."" Rabbits, skunks, game birds and smaller prey form its fare. The 2-3 white eggs are laid in an abandoned Hawk, Crow, or squirrel nest in February; it is the first of our northern birds to nest. SNOWY OWL _Nyctea nyctea_ A large Owl with no 'ear' tufts and yellow eyes; chiefly white with small brownish or blackish markings. L. 25. _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, migrating southward irregularly in winter to the northern United States. Washington, casual W.V. Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, rare and irregular W.V. N. Ohio, rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, very rare W.V. SE. Minn., common W.V., Oct.-Apl. A rare winter visitant which is more often seen along the seashore. Unlike most Owls it hunts by day, feeding chiefly on mice but also on birds. HAWK OWL _Surnia ulula caparoch_ A medium-sized Owl with a whitish face and yellow eyes and a _long, rounded_ tail; the head is spotted, the back barred with whitish; the underparts are barred with white and blackish. L. 15; T. 7-1/4. _Range._ Northern North America, rarely visiting the northern United States in winter. Cambridge, very rare in late fall. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE. Minn., uncommon W.V., Oct.-Mch. ""The Hawk Owl is strictly diurnal, as much so as any of the Hawks, and like some of them often selects a tall shrub or dead-topped tree in a comparatively open place for a perch, where it sits in the bright sunlight watching for its prey"" (Fisher). FLORIDA BURROWING OWL _Speotyto cunicularia floridana_ A small, ground Owl, with nearly naked legs and feet and no ear-tufts. The upperparts are grayish brown marked with white; the throat is white, rest of underparts barred with grayish brown and white. L. 9. _Range._ Southern Florida, chiefly in the Kissimmee Prairie region. This is a representative of our western Burrowing Owl, which, in some way unknown to man, has established itself far from others of its kind in central southern Florida, where it is locally common. It nests in a hole in the ground, excavated by itself, and lays 5-7 white eggs in March. PARROTS, MACAWS, PAROQUETS, COCKATOOS. ORDER PSITTACI PARROTS AND PAROQUETS. FAMILY PSITTACIDÃ CAROLINA PAROQUET _Conuropsis carolinensis carolinensis_ A long-tailed, green Paroquet with a yellow head, orange forehead and cheeks. L. 12-1/2. _Range._ Formerly southeastern United States north to Virginia, west to Nebraska and Texas; now southern Florida where it is on the verge of extinction, if not extinct. Washington, extinct, known only from specimens shot in Sept., 1865. The Paroquet has paid the penalty of wearing bright plumes, of making a desirable cage-bird, of being destructive to fruit, and of having little fear of man. Once abundant and wide-spread, for nearly the past half a century it has been restricted to Florida, where the species will soon go out of existence, if it has not already done so. Its nesting habits are unknown. CUCKOOS, KINGFISHERS, ETC. ORDER COCCYGES CUCKOOS, ANIS, ETC. FAMILY CUCULIDÃ YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO _Coccyzus americanus americanus. Case 7, Fig. 1_ Broadly white-tipped tail-feathers, a partly yellow bill, and largely reddish brown primaries distinguish this species from its black-billed cousin. L. 12-1/2, of which one-half is tail. _Range._ Nests from northern Florida to Canada; winters in tropical America, returning to the United States in April. Washington, common S.R., May 3-Oct. 13. Ossining, common S.R., May 4-Oct. 31. Cambridge, common S.R., May 12-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, quite common S.R., May 15-Sept. 29. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 21-Aug. 20. Cuckoos are common birds, but are more often heard than seen. Their notes are not like those of the cuckoo clock, which exactly imitates the voice of the European Cuckoo, but a series of _cuck-cuck-cucks_ and _cow-cows_ repeated a varying number of times. The Cuckoo rarely makes long flights but slips from one tree to another, seeking at once the inner branches and avoiding an exposed perch. The nest, a platform of sticks, thinly covered, is placed in low trees or bushes. The 3-5 greenish blue eggs are laid in May. BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO _Coccyzus erythrophthalmus. Case 7, Fig. 2_ A wholly black bill (note that in both our Cuckoos it is slightly curved), wings without reddish brown, and small, inconspicuous white tips to the tail-feathers distinguish this species from the preceding. _Range._ A more northern species than the Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Nests from Virginia (Georgia in the mountains) to Quebec; winters in tropical America, reaching the southern States in April. Washington, rather rare S.R., May 5-Oct. 6. Ossining, common S.R., May 3-Oct. 7. Cambridge, common S.R., May 12-Sept. 20. N. Ohio, tolerably common S.R., May 1-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, S.R., May 5-Oct. 21. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 8-Sept. 27. The day after penning the foregoing notes on the Yellow-billed Cuckoo, I saw a Black-bill make a prolonged, dashing flight through the open, alight on the limb of a dead, leafless tree, directly over a young girl who was calling loudly to an active dog near her, and from this conspicuous perch utter its low _coo-coo_ notes, both looking and sounding more like a Dove than a conventional Cuckoo. So while we may say that the Cuckoos are much alike in habits one must not accept generalized statements too literally. There is much individuality among birds, a fact that makes their study far more interesting than if all were cast in the same mold. The notes of this species are softer than those of the Yellow-bill, but the difference between the calls of the two species must be learned from the birds, not from books. The nest of the Black-bill is the more compactly built of the two, and its eggs are of a deeper shade. KINGFISHERS. FAMILY ALCEDINIDÃ BELTED KINGFISHER _Ceryle alcyon. Case 3, Fig. 18; Case 5, Fig. 10_ The female resembles the male, but the sides and the band across the breast are reddish brown. This is our only Kingfisher. Crest, color, size, habits, all distinguish him. L. 13. _Range._ North America; winters from Illinois and Virginia, southward; migrates north in early April. Washington, common P.R., except in midwinter. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 1-Nov. 23; casual in winter. Cambridge, common S.R., Apl. 10-Nov. 1; rare W.V. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 20-Nov. 1; rare W.V. Glenn Ellyn, isolated pairs, Apl. 1-Nov. 19. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 21-Dec. 12. The Belted Kingfisher is a watchman of the waterways who sounds his loud rattle when we trespass on his territory, a gallant fisherman, who, like a Falcon 'waits on' with fluttering wing, and the moment his aim is taken plunges headlong with a splash on some fish that has ventured too near the surface. The nest is made at the end of a burrow in a bank; 5-8 white eggs are laid in May. WOODPECKERS, WRYNECKS, ETC. ORDER PICI WOODPECKERS. FAMILY PICIDÃ IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER _Campephilus principalis_ Our largest Woodpecker, black with a white stripe down each side of the neck, white showing in the wing in flight, the male with a flaming red crest, the female with a black one and both with an ivory-white bill. L. 20. _Range._ Formerly southeastern United States to North Carolina; now rare and local in the wilder, less settled portions of the Gulf States. When man appears, the Ivory-bill disappears. This is not alone due to the destruction of the birds' haunts but to the bird's shy, retiring nature. Its days are numbered even more surely than are those of the forests it inhabits. The nesting cavity is usually made in a cypress some forty feet from the ground, and 3-5 white eggs are laid in March. HAIRY WOODPECKER _Dryobates villosus villosus. Case 2, Figs. 28, 29_ The Hairy is a large edition of the Downy with white, unmarked outer tail-feathers. The male has a red head-band. L. 9-1/2. _Range._ Middle and northern states; a permanent resident. The southern Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. auduboni_) inhabits the southeastern United States north to southern Virginia. It is smaller than the Hairy and has less white in the plumage. L. 8-1/10. The Northern Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. leucomelas_) is found from the northern United States northward. It is larger and whiter than the Hairy. L. 10. The Newfoundland Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. terrÃ¦novÃ¦_) is larger and darker than the Hairy; it inhabits Newfoundland. Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, rare P.R. Cambridge, uncommon W.V., one summer record. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, fairly common P.R. The Hairy is not so common as his small cousin the Downy, and does not so readily make friends. He prefers the woods to our orchards and is for these reasons less often seen at our feeding-stands. The Hairy's notes are noticeably louder than the Downy's. The nest-hole is usually in a dead tree. The 2-4 white eggs are laid the last half of April. DOWNY WOODPECKER _Dryobates pubescens medianus. Case 2, Figs. 26, 27_ The Downy differs from the Hairy Woodpecker in color by having the outer tail-feathers with black bars, but it is the bird's obviously smaller size that will serve to distinguish it. L. 6-3/4. _Range._ From Virginia northward into Canada. A Permanent Resident. The Southern Downy Woodpecker (_D. p. pubescens_, Case 3, Fig. 25) is smaller, darker below and with the white markings smaller. L. 6. It inhabits the south Atlantic and Gulf States north to North Carolina. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. Our commonest Woodpecker; an alert, active little driller for insects and their eggs and larvÃ¦, and frequent visitor to our lunch-counters, particularly if we supply them with suet. His sharp _peek, peek_, running at times into a diminishing string of _peeks_, and his rolling tatoo, as he pounds a limb with amazing rapidity, are prominent parts of every-day bird language, the tatoo being a 'song' of the breeding season. Four to six white eggs are laid in a hole, usually in a dead tree, the first week in May. The Southern Downy nests in April. RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER _Dryobates borealis_ Between the Downy and Hairy in size (L. 8-1/2) with a general resemblance to both, but the male with a small tuft of red feathers on each _side_ of the back of the head. _Range._ Southeastern States north to North Carolina. An inhabitant of the pine woods, who utters a coarse _yank-yank_ note and may at times be seen feeding from the terminal tufts of pine 'needles' in the higher branches. The nest is usually in a living pine; the 2-5 white eggs are laid in April. ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER _Picoides arcticus_ Two toes in front and one behind, a solid black back and an orange-yellow crown in the male distinguish this from all our other Woodpeckers. Size of the Hairy, L. 9-1/2. _Range._ Canada, and northern parts of our border states, rarely south in winter, as far as Nebraska and Ohio. Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE. Minn., rare. An inhabitant of the spruce and balsam forests of our northern states, occasionally straggling southward in winter. Nests in May. THREE-TOED WOODPECKER _Picoides americanus americanus_ Two toes in front and one behind, an orange-yellow crest in the male, and a black back _closely and evenly barred with white_ distinguish this bird; it is somewhat smaller than the preceding, L. 8-3/4. _Range._ Canada, south to the northern parts of our boundary states; unknown south of Massachusetts. Not so common as the Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker, and less often found south of its breeding range. Nests in early June. YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER _Sphyrapicus varius varius. Case 3, Fig. 26, Case 5, Fig. 30_ The female has the throat white, and rarely, crown wholly black. Young birds have the throat whitish, crown dull black, breast brownish. The black breast-patch and red forehead, and red or white throat are distinguishing characters. L. 8-1/2. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and Minnesota (in Alleghanies from North Carolina) to Canada; winters from Pennsylvania (rarely) southward to the Gulf States. Washington, common T.V., Mch.-May; Sept. and Oct., Occasional in winter. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 5-May 13; Sept. 18-Oct. 23; casual in winter. Cambridge, not uncommon T.V., Apl. and Sept. 15-Nov. 1; occasional W.V. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 1-May 20; Sept. 15-Oct. 20. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Mch. 31-May 12; Sept. 14-Oct. 13. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 19. This is the mysterious maker of the rows of little holes drilled in even lines, like hieroglyphics, on the trunks of apple and other trees. Using his brush-tipped tongue as a swab, he drinks the sap that oozes from these punctures. As a migrant the Yellow-belly is not conspicuous. His business takes him into the heart of living trees and he is usually seen only when flying from one to another. His low 'snarling' note attracts the attention of only the observant. The nest-hole is 25-40 feet up; the 5-7 white eggs are laid in May. PILEATED WOODPECKER _Phloeotomus pileatus pileatus_ Next to the nearly extinct Ivory-bill this is the largest of our Woodpeckers. (L. 17.) Both sexes have a flaming red crest (reaching the forehead in the male) the remainder of the plumage being black, with the throat, a stripe from the bill down the sides of the neck, and the basal half of the wing-feathers white; bill horn-color. _Range._ Southeastern and Gulf States, north to North Carolina. The Northern Pileated Woodpecker (_P. p. abieticola_) is found thence northward into Canada and west to the Pacific. It is a larger bird, with the white areas larger. In the south the Pileated is by no means rare and seems not averse to the presence of man; but in the north he retires to the wilder forested areas and we are apt to see him only when we go a-camping. And he is well worth seeing with his flaming crest and powerful bill which, used either as a chisel or drum-stick, produces impressive results. Strangely enough the Pileated's notes resemble those of the Flicker but are louder. The nest is usually well up; the 3-5 white eggs are laid in April in the south, in May in the north. RED-HEADED WOODPECKER _Melanerpes erythrocephalus. Case 3, Figs. 21, 22; Case 6, Fig. 43_ Adults of both sexes have the whole head red; young, during their first winter, have the head grayish brown, and a black band across the white wing-feathers. L. 9-3/4. _Range._ Eastern United States, west to Rockies; local east of the Alleghanies and north of Pennsylvania. Washington, rather common S.R., rare W.V. Ossining, rare P.R., common in fall, Aug. 27-Oct. 12. Cambridge, irregular at all seasons; sometimes common in fall. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 25; occasionally winters. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Feb. 19-Nov. 6; a few winter. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 4-Sept. 17; rare in winter. Adding to the normal habits of a Woodpecker marked skill as a flycatcher, the Red-head stops his grub-hunting and swings out after a passing insect with a dazzling display of red, white and blue-black. Noisy as he is conspicuous, he beats his log-drum, rolls a tree toad-like _krrring_, or, with tireless persistency utters a whistled croak. In the northeastern states Red-heads are distributed irregularly. They are rarely common in the summer, but in the fall they sometimes appear in numbers. Whenever they come we are soon aware of their presence. The nest is generally in a dead tree; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in May. RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER _Centurus carolinus. Case 3, Fig. 23_ Back and wings evenly barred with black and white, hence the name 'Zebra'; the female and young have the front part of the crown gray. L. 9-1/2. _Range._ Eastern United States, north to southern Pennsylvania, western New York and southern Minnesota; casually further. Washington, locally common P.R. Cambridge, A.V., one record. N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. SE. Minn., uncommon P.R. A common, hoarse-voiced resident of orange groves and gardens who with a _chuh-chuh_, jerkily hitches himself upward in the routine of the daily grub hunt. It is rare at the northern part of its range, but resident wherever found. The nest is in dead or living trees; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in late April or early May. NORTHERN FLICKER _Colaptes auratus luteus. Case 2, Figs. 21, 22; Case 3, Fig. 20_ The white rump and yellow wing-linings, displayed in flight; black breast-crescent, spotted underparts and fairly large size, readily distinguish this beautiful bird. The female very properly lacks the male's 'moustache.' L. 12. _Range._ Eastern North America, from North Carolina and southern Illinois to Canada and Alaska. The Southern Flicker (_C. a. auratus_) a smaller, darker race, inhabits the South Atlantic and Gulf States. Washington, common S.R., rare W.V. Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 30; a few winter. Cambridge, very common S.R., common W.V. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 10-Nov. 15 a few winter. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Mch. 7-Dec. 24; a few winter. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 21-Oct. 16. Thirty years ago the Flicker, High-hole or Yellow-hammer, was prey of any boy with a gun and was correspondingly wild and little known; now, thanks to the Audubon Society, he is almost as domestic as the Robin. In search of ants and their eggs, he hunts our lawns and even accepts the hospitality of our nest-logs. A great acquisition to our dooryard life is this bird of beautiful colors, quaint habits, and strange notes. His loud, strongly accented call, _kÃ©e-yer_, his rapidly repeated mellow _weÃ©chew, weÃ©chew_, possess character even if they lack musical quality. The Flicker nests in holes and lays from 5-9 white eggs in late April or early May. GOATSUCKERS, SWIFTS, HUMMINGBIRDS. ORDER MACROCHIRES NIGHTHAWKS, WHIP-POOR-WILLS, ETC. FAMILY CAPRIMULGIDÃ CHUCKWILL'S WIDOW _Antrostromus carolinensis. Case 6, Fig. 40_ A larger, browner bird than the Whip-poor-will, with branched, not simple bristles at the sides of the bill. Breast-patch whiter in the male than in the female. L. 12. _Range._ Southern states north to Virginia; wintering from southern Florida southward and migrating northward in March. Washington, one record. Cambridge, A.V., one record, Dec. What the Whip-poor-will is to the north the Chuckwill is to the south. The difference in their names expresses the syllabic difference in their calls, but the Chuckwill's notes are uttered more evenly and lack the marked accent on the first ""Whip"" of its northern cousin's song. The Chuckwill lays its two eggs in April on the ground in the woods, where it lives. They are white with delicate lilac markings and a few brownish spots. WHIP-POOR-WILL _Antrostomus vociferus vociferus. Case 6, Fig. 41_ Outer wing-quills barred with rusty, breast-band white in the male, buff in the female. L. 9-3/4. _Range._ Breeds from northern Georgia north to Canada, winters from the Gulf States southward, starting north in April. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 13-Oct 13. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 19-Oct. 17. Cambridge, formerly S.R., now chiefly T.V., Apl. 30-Sept. 20. N. Ohio, locally common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, rare, spring records only, Apl. 19-May 21. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 17-Sept. 28. A mysterious, silent, flitting shadow, should we chance to arouse it from its sleep in the forest by day, at dusk the Whip-poor-will takes the center of the stage and announces his presence to the world. _Whi['p]-poor-will, whi['p]-poor-will_ he calls with a snap and a swinging rhythm that makes the twilight ring with the oft-repeated notes. Two eggs are laid on the ground in the woods in May. They are dull white with delicate obscure lilac markings, and a few brownish gray spots. NIGHTHAWK _Chordeiles virginianus virginianus. Case 6, Fig. 39_ A white mark across the black outer wing-quills is very conspicuous in flight; seen from below it suggests a hole in the bird's wing. The female has the throat buff and no white band in the tail. L. 10. _Range._ Eastern North America from the Gulf States and Georgia north to Canada and Alaska. Winters in the tropics coming north in April. The Florida Nighthawk (_C. v. chapmani_) a smaller race (L. 8-1/2) is a Summer Resident in the Gulf States. Washington, not common S.R.; abundant T.V., Apl. 19-Oct. 8. Ossining, common S.R., May 9-Oct. 11. Cambridge, rare S.R., common T.V., May 15-Sept. 25. N. Ohio, locally common S.R., May 1-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., common T.V., May 1-Oct. 14. SE. Minn., common S.R.. May 4-Sept. 30. Doubtless because we see the Nighthawk and only hear the Whip-poor-will the notes of the latter have been often attributed to the former, with the result that many people think there is but one species. While it is true that there is a general resemblance in form, in details of color and markings, the two birds are quite unlike, while so far as notes and habits are concerned, few members of the same family differ more. The Whip-poor-will haunts the shadows of the woods and rarely flies far above the ground, the Nighthawk, like a Swift, courses high in the open, even over city house-tops, where anyone who looks may see him. The Whip-poor-will's notes have made him famous, the Nighthawk calls only a nasal _peent, peent_, and, diving earthward on set wings, produces a hollow, booming sound. Both nest on the ground, but the Nighthawk lays in the fields or on pebbly roofs, and its two finely marked eggs (laid in May or June) are quite unlike those of the Whip-poor-will. SWIFTS. FAMILY MICROPODIDÃ CHIMNEY SWIFT _ChÃ¦tura pelagica. Case 6. Fig. 42_ A near relative of the Hummingbird, not of Swallows. Note the 'spine'-tipped tail-feathers. _Range._ Eastern North America; winters in Central America; reaches the Gulf States in March. Washington, abundant S.R., Apl. 6-Oct. 27. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 19-Oct. 23. Cambridge, abundant S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 20. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 20. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Apl. 16-Sept. 29. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 18. A twittering courser of evening skies who makes his home in our chimneys. Here the bracket-like nest of dead twigs is attached to the bricks by the bird's saliva, to be loosened, at times, after heavy rains and fall to the fire-place below. In the fall great flocks roost in chimneys, generally large ones, returning night after night. The 4-6 white eggs are laid in May. HUMMINGBIRDS. FAMILY TROCHILIDÃ RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD _Archilochus colubris. Case 7, Figs. 4, 3_ Females and young lack the 'ruby' throat. _Range._ Eastern North America, nesting from Florida to Quebec; winters from central Florida to Panama. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 23-Oct. 23. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 30-Oct. 3. Cambridge, very common T.V., uncommon S.R., May 10-Sept. 20. N. Ohio, common S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, rare S.R., May 1-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 19-Oct. 8. Any Hummingbird seen east of the Mississippi may, with confidence, be called a Ruby-throat; exceptions will probably prove to be sphinx moths, which, it must be confessed, look singularly hummingbird-like as they hover before flowers. When the eggs are laid the male deserts the female, leaving to her the task of incubation and care of the young. The nest, most exquisite of bird homes, is saddled to a limb usually 15 or more feet up. The two bean-like white eggs are laid in May. PERCHING BIRDS. ORDER PASSERES FLYCATCHERS. FAMILY TYRANNIDÃ KINGBIRD _Tyrannus tyrannus. Case 7, Fig. 6_ Note the white-tipped tail; young birds lack the orange crest. L. 8-1/2. _Range._ North America; nests from northern Florida to Canada; winters in South America, reaching Florida in March. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 18-Sept. 23. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 10. Cambridge, common S.R. May 5-Sept. 1. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., Apl. 16-Sept. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 26-Aug. 31. A valiant defender of his home who, at the approach of Crow or Hawk, utters his steely, chattering, battle-cry and sallies forth to attack. Fearlessly he plunges down on an enemy many times his size who dodging this way and that beats a hasty retreat before his active, aggressive assailant. In the fall migration Kingbirds gather in loose flocks. The nest is placed near the end of a branch about 20 feet up; the 3-5 white eggs spotted with dark brown, are laid in May. GRAY KINGBIRD _Tyrannus dominicensis dominicensis. Case 7, Fig. 7_ Resembles the Kingbird but is lighter gray, and the tail lacks the conspicuous white tip. _Range._ West Indies, nesting north through Florida to southeastern South Carolina; winters to South America; reaches Florida early in May. A not uncommon summer resident in parts of Florida and the coastal region of Georgia and South Carolina, with the general habits and appearance of our Kingbird, but with a quite different call which suggests the words _pitÃ­rri-pitÃ­rri_. It nests in May, laying four salmon-colored eggs, marked with dark brown and lilac. CRESTED FLYCATCHER _Myiarchus crinitus. Case 7, Fig. 5_ The reddish brown tail-feathers may sometimes be seen and the crest is usually evident. L. 9. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from Florida to Canada; winters in the tropics, reaching Florida on its northward journey in March. Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 29. Ossining, common S.R., May 7-Sept. 12. Cambridge, rare S.R., May 15-Sept. 11. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 1-Sept. 18. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 25. A character of the woods distinguished alike by appearance, voice and habits. His crested head seems too big for his body; his exclamatory whistle, which sounds like a shout above a monotone of conversation, his habit of always lining his nest with a cast-off snake skin, all mark him as an odd genius. Even his wife's eggs, with their long chocolate streaks, are quite unlike any other birds' eggs. They are laid in a hole in a tree in May or June. PHOEBE _Soyornis phoebe. Case 4, Fig. 52; Case 5, Fig. 15_ Head slightly crested, somewhat darker than body. In the fall the underparts are tinged with yellow. L. 7. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from northern Mississippi and northwestern Georgia to Canada; winters from South Carolina to Mexico. The only Flycatcher to winter in the eastern United States and hence the first to reach us in the spring. Washington, common S.R., Feb. 25-Oct.; occasionally winters. Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 14-Oct. 29. Cambridge, common T.V., and not uncommon S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 10. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 14-Oct. 15. Glen Ellyn, S.R., Mch. 13-Oct. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 22-Oct. 11. The Phoebe is the best known member of a group of small Flycatchers which the beginner, and not infrequently the advanced student, names with more or less uncertainty. Fortunately for the field student, and as if to compensate for their close resemblance in plumage, they all possess distinctive, quite unlike, and easily recognizable calls, and consequently can readily be identified by their voices if not by their colors. The Phoebe shows so marked a fondness for our society, nesting under our piazzas, in barns or outbuildings, and calls his _pewit-phoebe_ so plainly, wagging his tail the while in a friendly, sociable kind of a way, that there is never any doubt about his identity; but we will not make the acquaintance of his less common, less confiding relatives so readily. The Phoebe's 4-6 white eggs (rarely with a few brown spots) are laid the latter half of April. OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER _Nuttalornis borealis. Case 8, Fig. 59_ With the general appearance of a large Phoebe, but with the breast and sides the color of the back, and a tuft of white feathers on each flank. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ North America; nests from northern New England northward (southward in the Alleghanies to North Carolina); winters in the tropics. Washington, casual T.V. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 20; Aug. 15-Sept. 16. Cambridge, rare T.V., May 20-June 6; formerly not uncommon S.R., one Sept. record. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 13-June 11; Aug. 11-Sept. 15. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 10-Sept. 9. To most of us the Olive-sided is known as a rare migrant passing northward in May, among the later transients, and southward in September. When traveling the bird retains the fondness of its kind for perching on tall tree-tops, but its loud, unmistakable, whistled ""come right _here_, come right _here_"" is usually heard only on the nesting ground. The nest is placed in coniferous trees about 25 feet up, and 3-5 white, brown-spotted eggs are laid in June. WOOD PEWEE _Myiochanes virens. Case 8, Fig. 63_ Resembles the Phoebe but is smaller with relatively longer wings and more evident wing-bars. L. 6-1/2. _Range._ Eastern North America; nesting from Florida to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 20-Oct. 12. Ossining, common S.R., May 10-Oct. 2. Cambridge, common T.V., not uncommon S.R., May 18-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., May 2-Sept. 27. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., May 9-Sept. 29. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 10-Sept. 23. In color Phoebe and Pewee are much alike and both are Flycatchers, but the resemblance ends there. Pewee loves the solitude of the forest rather than the sociability of the barnyard, and his pensive _pee-a-wee_ does not even suggest the business-like _pewit-phoebe_ of his better-known cousin. Nor does his dainty lichen-covered nest saddled so skillfully on the limb of a forest tree, recall the Phoebe's bulky moss and mud dwelling. Finally, the Pewee's eggs, laid in May, are wreathed with brown. YELLOW-BELLIED FLYCATCHER _Empidonax flaviventris. Case 8. Fig. 61_ The entire underparts, including the throat, are unquestionably sulphur-yellow. L. 5-1/2 _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from northern New York and northern New England northward into Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather common T.V., May; July 28-Oct. 6. Ossining, common T.V., May 17-June 4; Aug. 8-Sept. 20. Cambridge, T.V., sometimes rather common, May 25-June 3; Aug. 28-Sept. 8. N. Ohio, rare T.V., May 10. Glen Ellyn, rather rare T.V., May 20-June 5; Sept. 3. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 19. Known chiefly as a not common migrant who visits our woods on his journey to and from his northern home. He is a silent traveler and gives no clue to his identity by calling or singing, but his underparts are so much yellower than those of any other of our small Flycatchers that they make a definite field character. Nests in coniferous forests on the ground, laying 4 white, lightly spotted eggs in June. ACADIAN FLYCATCHER _Empidonax virescens. Case 8, Fig. 60_ Throat white, upperparts bright, light olive-green, without tinge of brown as in the Alder Flycatcher. _Range._ Eastern North America; rather southern, nesting from Florida north to Connecticut and Michigan; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. Ossining, common S.R., May 10-Aug. 27. N. Ohio, common S.R., May 4-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 6-Aug. 27, and probably later. On the low-sweeping limb of a beech over a stream is an ideal site for the frail nest of the Acadian. The bird is never found far from it and its low-ranging habits permit us to see its characteristic markings and hear its peculiar sudden, explosive little _pee-e-yÃºk_ and more commonly uttered _spee_ or _peet_. The creamy white, brown-spotted eggs are laid the latter part of May. ALDER FLYCATCHER _Empidonax trailli alnorum. Case 8, Fig. 62_ Larger than the Least Flycatcher, but resembling it in having the back olive-brown instead of olive-green as in the Acadian and Yellow-bellied Flycatchers. L. 6. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from northern New Jersey (locally) and mountains of West Virginia to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, irregularly common T.V., May 8-May 28; Aug. 16-Sept. 17. Ossining, rare T.V., May 19-May 31; Aug. 29. Cambridge, rare T.V., May 28-June 6; Aug.; occasional in summer. Traill's Flycatcher (_E. t. trailli_), a slightly browner bird is the Mississippi Valley form. N. Ohio, common S.R., May 7-Sept. 10. Glen Ellyn, quite common S.R., May 14-Sept. 19. S.E. Minn., common S.R., May 6-Aug. 10. A rare recluse of the alders who, traveling silently between his summer and his winter homes, makes few friends among men. Dwight describes its call note as ""a single _pep_,"" and its song as _ee-zee-e-up_, resembling that of the Acadian. The bird places the nest low down in the crotch of one of the bushes among which it lives and lays 3-4 white, brown-spotted eggs in June. LEAST FLYCATCHER _Empidonax minimus. Case 6, Fig. 44_ Smallest of the Flycatchers; like the Alder Flycatcher its back is olive-brown rather than olive-green; no evident yellow on the underparts. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from Iowa, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 20-May 20; Aug. 13-Sept. 15. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 25-Aug. 26. Cambridge, very common S.R., May 1-Aug. 25. N. Ohio, common T.V. Apl. 15-May 25; Aug. 25-Oct. 1; rare in summer. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., chiefly T.V., May 4-Sept. 24. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 13. A Flycatcher of lawns and orchard, seldom going far from the tree in which its nest with its white eggs is placed. A dry-voiced little bird whose unmusical, but distinctly uttered _chebÃ©c, chebÃ©c_ makes up in character what it lacks in sweetness. Between whiles he swings out for a passing insect only to call _chebÃ©c, chebÃ©c, chebÃ©c_ when he returns to his perch. LARKS. FAMILY ALAUDIDÃ PRAIRIE HORNED LARK _Otocoris alpestris praticola. Case 2, Fig. 42_ Note the long hind-toe nail (or the track it leaves), the little feathered 'horns,' the black patch on cheeks and breast (less evident in winter). Smaller than the Northern Horned Lark, which visits the United States only in winter, with the line over the eye white, and throat but faintly tinged with yellow. L. 7-1/4. _Range._ Nests in the Upper Mississippi Valley from Missouri and in the Atlantic States (locally), from Connecticut northward; winters southward to Texas and Georgia. The Horned Lark (_Otocoris alpestris alpestris_), is a more northern race, nesting in the Arctic regions and migrating southward as far as Ohio and rarely Georgia, when it is often associated with the resident Prairie Horned Lark. It is larger than that race (L. 7-3/4) and has the throat and line over the eye yellow. Washington, common W.V., Aug. 11-Apl. Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., S.R., Mch.-Nov., a few in mild winters. A bird of open places--shores, plains, and prairies, and roadways--who runs (not hops) nimbly ahead of one, or, with a short note, rises, and on its long, pointed wings, flies on ahead. He usually returns to the ground, but may alight on a fence; his long hind toe-nail not being suited to grasping a small perch. The weak, twittering song is uttered on the wing, when the bird, like its relative the Skylark, mounts into the air. It also sings from a perch near the ground. The Prairie Horned Lark is the first of our small birds to nest, making its home on the ground and laying four finely speckled eggs early in March. After the nesting season the birds gather in flocks. CROWS, JAYS, ETC. FAMILY CORVIDÃ BLUE JAY _Cyanocitta cristata cristata. Case 2, Fig. 20_ Color, habits and voice combine to render the Blue Jay conspicuous. L. 11-3/4. _Range._ Eastern North America from Georgia to Quebec; migratory only at the northern limit of its range. The Florida Blue Jay (_Cyanocitta cristata florincola_, Case 4, Fig. 75) is smaller (L. 10-3/4) and grayer above. It is found throughout Florida. Washington, rather rare P.R., common T.V., Apl. 28-May 15; Sept. 15-Oct. 15. Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R., abundant T.V., Apl. and May; Sept. and Oct. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. If the Blue Jay were as good as he is beautiful he would be our most popular bird. But fine feathers do not always make fine birds, and to those who judge birds by human standards the Blue Jay's loud, harsh voice, overbearing manners, and nest-robbing habits are unpardonable. With all his faults, however, the true bird enthusiast loves him still. His bright colors, dashing ways and intelligence win our admiration and we feel honored when he makes his home near ours, building in early May a well-made nest in a tree-crotch, for the reception of the 4-6 olive-green, thickly speckled eggs. FLORIDA JAY _Aphelocoma cyanea_ Size of the Blue Jay but quite unlike it in color. The head, wings and tail are grayish blue without white markings; the back is pale brown, the underparts dirty white, with the throat inconspicuously streaked and a faint bluish breast-band. _Range._ Florida between lat. 27Â° and 30Â°, and chiefly along the coasts. This is the 'Scrub-Jay' of Florida and is not to be confused with the Florida Blue Jay. It lives in districts where scrub palmetto grows, but also comes into gardens and grows where it soon responds to proper treatment and becomes semi-domesticated. It nests early in April. CANADA JAY. _Perisoreus canadensis canadensis_ Size of the Blue Jay; a gray bird with a black crown and white forehead, cheeks and throat. _Range._ Northern New England and northern New York, northward; resident, rarely straggling southward. Cambridge, A.V., one record, Oct. It is singular that the Canada Jay at the north and the Florida Jay in the south should show exceptional confidence in man, while the Blue Jay always seems to regard him with suspicion. The very day we make camp in the north woods the Canada Jay or Whiskey Jack becomes our guest. As though assured of a welcome he fearlessly joins our party, helping himself to such supplies as please his fancy. Long before our arrival, when snow still covered the ground, he has reared his family and for the rest of the year has only his own wants to fill. RAVEN _Corvus corax principalis_ Much larger than the Crow, the throat with long, pointed feathers, instead of short, rounded ones. L. 24. _Range._ North America rare and local in the Eastern States, south to New Jersey on the coast and to Georgia in the mountains. Crows _caw_, while Ravens _croak_; but to be sure that you have actually seen a Raven he should be with Crows, when the Raven's much larger size is evident. Unless, however, you should visit the few localities in the eastern States where Ravens live you are not likely to make the bird's acquaintance. Ravens nest on cliffs as well as in trees. Their eggs, which resemble those of the Crow in color, are laid in April. CROW _Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos. Case 1, Fig. 19; Case 3, Fig. 27_ Sexes alike in color. L. 19-1/2. _Range._ North America; migratory at the northern limit of its range; roosting in colonies in winter. Washington, abundant P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R. abundant T.V. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch.-Nov., uncommon W.V. The Crow and the Robin are probably the best known of all our birds. The former we treat as an enemy and the latter as a friend, and one therefore is as wild as the other is tame. Whether the Crow deserves to be outlawed has not as yet been decided. But we should not condemn him out of court and let us remember that as an intelligent, self-respecting citizen, who animates wintry wastes with his shining sable form and clarion call, he has other than economic claims to our consideration. The nest is placed in a tree about 30 feet up, and 4-6 eggs, green thickly marked with brownish are laid in April. The Florida Crow (_C. b. pascuus_) is very near the northern bird, but has the wings and tail smaller, the bill and feet larger. It lives chiefly in the pine barrens of Florida and is much less common in the state than the Fish Crow. FISH CROW _Corvus ossifragus_ Brighter, more uniformly colored above and below, the feathers without dull tips. _Range._ Atlantic and Gulf coast region from the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island Sound southward. Migratory only at the northern limit of its range. Found throughout Florida, but elsewhere usually not far from tidal water. Washington, rather common P.R. Cambridge, A.V., one record, Mch. In life the Fish Crow may be distinguished from the common Crow by its smaller size and hoarser voice. The difference in size, however, is evident only when the two are together, but once the cracked, reedy _car_ (not _caw_) of the Fish Crow has been learned the species may always be identified when heard. It is somewhat like the note of a young Crow, but less immature. The nest and eggs are much like those of the common Crow. The eggs are laid in May. STARLINGS. FAMILY STURNIDÃ STARLING _Sturnus vulgaris. Case 2, Figs. 24, 25_ In winter conspicuously dotted with whitish; in summer with but few dots and a yellow bill; at all times with a short tail and long wings. L 8-1/2. _Range._ Introduced from Europe into Central Park, New York City, in 1890, now more or less numerous from Virginia to Maine; occasional west of the Alleghanies. It is a quick, active bird, probing the ground now this side, now that, as it walks rapidly over our lawns. The short tail and long wings are most noticeable in the air and distinguish the Starling from our other black birds. A long-drawn whistle, such as one calls to a dog, is the Starling's most common note, but it has many others. It nests in April, often after quarreling with Flickers for possession of a nest-hole in which to lay its pale bluish eggs. The young appear in mid-May and their harsh, rasping food-call is a common note for several weeks; then the birds begin to gather in companies which, later, form flocks of thousands. BLACKBIRDS, ORIOLES, ETC. FAMILY ICTERIDÃ BOBOLINK _Dolichonyx oryzivorus. Case 7, Figs. 13, 14_ In July, after nesting, the male molts into a plumage resembling that of the female, when both are known as Reedbird. L 7-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New Jersey and northern Missouri to southern Canada and westward to British Columbia; leaves the United States through Florida and winters chiefly in northwestern Argentina; returns to United States early in April. Washington, T.V., common in spring, abundant in fall; Apl. 26-May 30; July 23-Nov. 14. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., May 1-Oct. 5. Cambridge, very common S.R., May 8-Sept. 10. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, S.R., Apl. 27-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 5-Aug. 27. A bird with a dual personality; welcome minstrel of the meadows when nesting, dread scourge of the rice-fields when traveling. With the loss of his trim suit of black, white, and buff, Bob loses also his merry tinkling, rippling song, and acquires with his streaked Reedbird suit a single watchword. _Tink, tink_ he calls from somewhere overhead, and _tink, tink_ his comrades answer as they follow a trackless path through the sky on their 5000-mile journey. The nest is placed on the ground and 4-7 grayish, blotched eggs are laid late in May or early in June. COWBIRD _Molothrus ater ater. Case 5, Figs. 8, 9_ The male's brown head distinguishes him from other Blackbirds; the female wears a dull gray garb well designed to make her inconspicuous. L. 8. _Range._ North America; nesting from North Carolina and Louisiana to Canada; winters from Virginia and Ohio southward. Washington, rather rare P.R., common T.V. Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 23-Nov. 11. Cambridge, common S.R., Mch. 25-Nov. 1; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 10-Nov. 15. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Mch. 15-Sept. 10. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 11-Aug. 19. Outlaws among birds, they pair not neither do they build. Without moral standards or maternal instincts the female accepts the attention of any male that chances to win her fancy and deposits her eggs in the nests of other birds. She is a slacker and a shirker, who keeps much in the background during the breeding season. Color, habit, his sliding, glassy whistle, and guttural gurgling, make the male conspicuous. Leaving the care of their foster parents the young join others of their kind and flock in the grainfields or about cattle in the pastures. YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD _Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus. Case 6, Fig. 45_ Large size and a yellow head distinguish the male; the female is duller, the body brownish, the head yellowish. L. 10. _Range._ Mississippi Valley and westward, breeding from northern Illinois northward to Canada; winters from the west Gulf coast and southern California into Mexico; accidental east of the Alleghanies. Washington, A.V., one instance, Aug. Cambridge, A.V., one record, Oct. Glen Ellyn, A.V., May 21, 1898. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 21. Hanging their cradle nest in the quill-reeds or rushes, the Yellow-heads are not found far from it until the young take wing. The male entertains his mate with a variety of strange calls and whistles, but leaves to her the hatching of the brown speckled eggs and care of the young while they are in the nest. Like other Blackbirds they migrate and winter in flocks. RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD _Agelaius phoeniceus phoeniceus. Case 5, Figs. 5, 6_ The male in spring and early summer is unmistakable; in winter his feathers are tipped with brownish, more pronounced in the young. The streaked females require closer scrutiny. L. 9-1/2. _Range._ Eastern North America, nests from Florida to Canada; winters from Maryland southward, sometimes farther north. The Florida Red-wing (_A. p. floridanus_, Case 4, Figs. 28, 29) is smaller and with a slenderer bill. It inhabits Florida (except the southeast coast and Keys) and ranges west along the Gulf coast to Texas. The Bahama Red-wing (_A. p. bahamensis_) is still smaller. It is resident in southeastern Florida, the Keys and Bahamas. Washington, common P.R., abundant in migration. Ossining, common S.R., Feb. 25-Nov. 11. Cambridge, abundant S.R., Mch. 10-Aug. 30; a few winter. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 1-Nov. 15. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 19. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 8-Nov. 14. The Red-wing's mellow _kong-quer-reee_ is as certain an indication of the presence of water as is the piping of frogs in the spring. It may be only a bit of boggy marshland, it may be a reedy lakeside, but water there will surely be. On a frequented perch he half spreads his wings, fluffs out his scarlet epaulets, bursting into bloom, as it were, when he utters his notes--a singing flower! The nest is in the alders, button-bushes, or reeds, or even on the ground, and although the birds come in March, their pale blue, spotted, blotched, and scrawled eggs are not laid until May. Except when nesting, Red-wings live in flocks. MEADOWLARK _Sturnella magna magna. Case 2, Fig. 23_ A large, quail-like bird which shows white outer tail-feathers when it flies; if one can obtain a front view, the yellow underparts and black breast-crescent are conspicuous. L. 10-3/4. _Range._ Eastern North America, rare west of the Mississippi; nesting from North Carolina and Missouri to Canada; winters from southern New England and northern Ohio southward. The Southern Meadowlark (_S. m. argutula_, Case, 4, Fig. 79) is smaller and darker. It is resident in the south Atlantic and Gulf States. Washington, common P.R., less common in winter. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Feb. 20-Nov. 27; a few winter. Cambridge, common S.R., not common W.V. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 15; a few winter. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Jan. 24-Nov. 15; irregular W.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 15; rare W.V. The Meadowlark is a fifer of the fields, whose high, clear whistle is one of the most welcome bird songs of early spring. In May, when nesting, it often sings an ecstatic twittering warble on the wing. The alarm calls are an unmusical _dzit_ or _yert_ and a string of beady, metallic notes. The nest is placed on the ground. The 4-6 eggs are white, speckled with brown. WESTERN MEADOWLARK _Sturnella neglecta_ Grayer than the Eastern Meadowlark, with disconnected tail-bars and yellow spreading to the sides of the throat. _Range._ Western United States, rare east of the Mississippi. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 15. With the general appearance and habits of the Eastern Meadowlark, but differing in its call-notes and song. Instead of the sharp _dzit_ or _yert_ and metallic twitter of the eastern bird, the western species calls _chuck_, _chuck_, followed by a rolling _b-r-r-r-_. The eastern bird plays the fife but the western uses the flute, and its bubbling grace-notes are easily distinguishable from the _straight_ whistling of its eastern cousin. ORCHARD ORIOLE _Icterus spurius. Case 7, Figs. 10-12_ Adult males are unmistakable, but females and young males in their first fall wear a non-committal costume and must be looked at sharply. In their first nesting season, young males resemble the female but have a black throat. This is a smaller, more slender bird than the Baltimore Oriole, and the female is less orange. L. 7-1/4. _Range._ Eastern United States, nesting from the Gulf States to Massachusetts and Minnesota; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 20-Aug. 22. Ossining, common S.R., May 2-Aug. 6. Cambridge, S.R., sometimes rather common, May 15-July. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 5. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., Apl. 38. SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., May 10-Aug. 26. In the northern part of its range, the Orchard Oriole is somewhat less common, and more local than the Baltimore Oriole, while its duller colors and more retiring habits make it more difficult to see. The voice is richer, more cultured--if one may use the term--than that of its brilliant orange-plumed cousin; indeed, in my opinion, this species deserves a place in the first rank of our songsters. The nest of finely woven grasses is not so deep as that of the Baltimore. Three to five bluish white eggs, spotted and scrawled with black, are laid the latter part of May. BALTIMORE ORIOLE _Icterus galbula. Case 7, Figs. 8, 9_ The orange and black male needs no introduction; the female is tinted with orange strongly enough to show her relationship. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from northern Georgia to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 29-Aug. 26. Ossining, common S.R., May 2-Sept. 1. Cambridge, very common S.R., May 8 through Aug. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 15-Sept. 10. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Apl. 26-Sept. 4. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 1-Sept. 1. This is the orange-and-black whistler of our fruit and shade trees, whose wife skillfully weaves a pendant cradle at the end of some drooping branch, therein to lay her white eggs curiously marked with fine lines and blotches of black. The young, after leaving the nest in June, have a loud, babyish food-call, _dee-dee-dee-dee_, repeated time after time until their wants are satisfied. RUSTY BLACKBIRD _Euphagus carolinus. Case 5, Figs. 3, 4_ The bird's common name is based on the fall plumage of the male, which is broadly margined with rusty. By spring these tips wear off and the bird is glossy black. Size of the Red-wing but with a whitish eye and no red; the female unstreaked. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from the northern part of the northern states to Canada; winters from New Jersey and Ohio to the Gulf States. Washington, common W.V., Oct. 13-Apl. 30. Ossining, common T.V., Mch. 26-May 8; Sept. 28-Nov. 27. Cambridge, very common T.V., Mch. 10-May 8; Sept. 15-Oct. 31. N. Ohio, common T.V., Mch. 5-May 10; Sept. 10-Nov. 15. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Mch. 3-May 8; Sept. 12-Nov. 15; uncommon W.V. SE. Minn., common T.V., Mch. 26-Nov. 24. This is the least conspicuous of our Blackbirds. It nests chiefly north of the United States, migrates in small flocks, and is less noisy than the Red-wing or Grackle and not so much in evidence as the Cowbird. Dwight describes its notes as ""a confused medley of whistles, sweeter and higher-pitched than those of the Red-wing."" It nests in May, building in coniferous trees or near the ground, and laying 4-7 greenish eggs, heavily marked with brown and purple. PURPLE GRACKLE _Quiscalus quiscula quiscula. Case 5, Fig. 1_ Plumage varied with metallic and iridescent reflections; tail long, fan-shaped, often 'keeled' in flight; eye pale yellow. Male, L. 12-1/2. The female is smaller and duller; L. 10-1/2. _Range._ Eastern North America; nests east of the Alleghanies from northern Georgia to Connecticut; winters from Maryland southward. Washington, common T.V. and S.R., Feb. 20; a few winter. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Feb. 15-Nov. 8. Cambridge, rare S.R. The Florida Grackle (_Quiscalus quiscula aglÃ¦us_, Case 4, Fig. 74) is smaller than the Purple Grackle and has the head and neck violet-purple, the back bottle-green. It is resident in Florida and the Gulf States north to South Carolina. The Bronzed Grackle (_Quiscalus quiscula oeneus_, Case 5, Fig. 2) is the same size as the Purple Grackle, but has the body bronzy without iridescent markings. It nests from Texas up the Mississippi Valley and eastward through central New York and Massachusetts to New Brunswick, north to Canada; and in migration is found in the range of the Purple Grackle. It winters from the Ohio Valley southward. Washington, rare T.V., Feb 20-Apl. 17. Ossining, common T.V., Apl; Nov. Cambridge, abundant. S.R., Mch. 10-Nov. 1; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, abundant, S.R., Mch. 1-Nov. 15; rarely winters. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 15, SE. Minn, common S.R., Mch, 18-Nov. 1; rare in winter. The Grackle is the largest of our northern Blackbirds. In the south it is exceeded in size only by the Boat-tailed Grackle. It migrates in flocks and nests in colonies, often in parks and cemeteries. It feeds chiefly on the ground and is frequently seen upon our lawns when it may be known by its rather waddling, walking gait, and its long tail. Its notes are harsh, cracked and discordant, but when heard in chorus make a pleasing medley. The nest is sometimes placed in pines about 30 feet up, but also in bushes and even in holes in trees. The 3-7 eggs are usually pale bluish, heavily blotched and scrawled with brown and black. BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE _Megaquiscalus major major_ The male is a long-tailed, glossy blue-black bird. (L. 16.) The female is much smaller (L. 12), blackish brown above, buff below. _Range._ Florida north on the Atlantic coast to Virginia; west to Texas. This giant Grackle frequents lakes, lagoons and bays, where it feeds along the shore or among aquatic plants. The male, a poseur among birds, strikes strange attitudes with bill pointing skyward, and with apparent effort forces out hoarse whistles. The female is quiet and unassuming. They nest in colonies, building in bushes and laying in April 3-5 bluish white eggs, strikingly blotched and scrawled with blackish. FINCHES, SPARROWS, ETC. FAMILY FRINGILLIDÃ EVENING GROSBEAK _Hesperiphona vespertina vespertina_ A large, thick-set, heavy-billed, black and yellow Finch. The male with the forehead and most of the body yellow, the crown, wings and tail black; the inner wing-quills white. The female is brownish gray, more or less tinged with yellow, the wings and tail black with white markings. L. 8. _Range._ Western North America, wintering regularly eastward to Minnesota and irregularly to the North Atlantic States. Glen Ellyn, one record, Dec. 11, 1889. SE. Minn., common W.V., Oct. 17-May 19. [Illustration: EVENING GROSBEAK. Male and Female.] The Evening Grosbeak is a notable traveler from the far northwest whose rare, irregular, and unheralded visits and striking appearance make him always a welcome and distinguished guest. Of recent years these birds have come to the east with greater frequency, arriving in November and remaining as late as May. They feed largely on the buds and seeds of trees--maple and box-elder--and can often be attracted to our feeding-stations by the offer of sunflower seeds. They are usually associated in flocks of from six to eight to ten birds, and their notes when perching, have been described as resembling the jingle of small sleigh-bells, while their song is said to be a ""wandering jerky warble."" PINE GROSBEAK _Pinicola enucleator leucura. Case 2, Figs. 53, 54_ Adult males are unmistakable; but young males and female might be confused with the female Evening Grosbeak, but they lack the conspicuous white markings in the wings and tail of that species. L. 9. _Range._ Northern North America, wintering southward irregularly to Indiana and New Jersey; rarely as far as Kentucky and Washington. Washington, casual in winter. Ossining, irregular W.V., Dec. 18-Apl. 12. Cambridge, irregular W.V., frequently common, sometimes abundant, Nov. 1-Mch. 25. N. Ohio, occasional W.V. Glen Ellyn, uncommon and irregular W.V., Oct. 25-? SE. Minn., uncommon W.V. In the summer the Pines Grosbeak lives in coniferous forests, but on its irregular wanderings southward, like the Evening Grosbeak, it feeds upon the seeds of deciduous trees and bushes. The Grosbeak's call-note is a clear whistle of three or four notes which may be easily imitated; its song is said to be prolonged and melodious. The Pine and Evening Grosbeaks would be notable figures in any gathering of birds, but coming at the most barren time of the year when our bird population is at the minimum and the trees are leafless, they are as welcome as they are conspicuous. PURPLE FINCH _Carpodacus purpureus purpureus. Case 2, Figs. 32, 33; Case 4, Figs. 48, 49_ The adult male is dull rose rather than purple, the female is sparrow-like in appearance but may be known by a whitish line over the eye and the company she keeps. Young males resemble their mother their first winter. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Eastern North America; nesting from northern Illinois and northern New Jersey northward to Canada; winters from the Middle States to the Gulf. Washington, common W.V., Sept. 12-May 26, largely a migrant. Ossining, rare P.R., common T.V. Cambridge, P.R. common from Apl. to Oct.; irregular, but sometimes abundant in winter. N. Ohio, common W.V., Sept. 1-May 20. Glen Ellyn, fairly common T.V., Mch.-Apl., Sept.-Oct., uncommon W.V. Erratic wanderers which travel on no fixed schedule but seem to feel at home wherever they find themselves. Except when nesting, they usually live in small flocks which, if the fare of our feeding-stands please them, will sometimes live with us for weeks. The call-note is _creak-creak_, the song a flowing, musical warble often uttered in detached fragments. Four to six bluish, spotted eggs are laid in May; the nest being generally built in a coniferous tree. ENGLISH SPARROW; HOUSE SPARROW _Passer domesticus domesticus. Case 2, Figs. 30, 31; Case 4, Figs. 38, 39_ Unfortunately too well known to require description. L. 6-1/2. _Range._ First introduced into this country at Brooklyn, N.Y., from Europe in 1851; now found everywhere at all times. Hardy, pugnacious and adaptable, the Sparrow is a notable success in the bird world. We could overlook his objectionable traits if he possessed a pleasant voice, but his harsh, discordant notes and incessant chatter are unfortunately in harmony with his character. After all he gives a welcome touch of life to city streets and yards. Sparrows' nests are made of almost anything the birds can carry and built in any place that will hold them. The 4-7 finely speckled eggs are laid as early as March, and several broods are raised. AMERICAN CROSSBILL _Loxia curvirostra minor. Case 2 Figs. 49, 50_ Crossbills have the mandibles crossed; the absence of wing-bars distinguishes this species from the usually less common White-winged Crossbill. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England to Canada and southward in the Alleghanies to northern Georgia. Winters irregularly southward, rarely as far as Florida and Louisiana. Washington, irregular W.V., sometimes abundant. Ossining, irregular; noted in almost every month. Cambridge, of common but irregular occurrence at all seasons. N. Ohio, irregular, often common, sometimes breeds. Glen Ellyn, uncommon and irregular, Oct. 20-June 11. SE. Minn., W.V., Oct. 25. Crossbills and Grosbeaks are among winter's chief attractions. While the latter, as I have said above, will leave their summer homes in coniferous forests to feed in winter on the seeds of deciduous trees, the Crossbills are less adaptable. They are specialists in cone-dissecting. Their singularly shaped bills prevent them from eating many kinds of food available to other birds, but no other birds can compete with them in extracting the seeds from cones. Having had too limited an experience with man to have learned to fear him, they are so surprisingly tame that I have known birds to be plucked from trees as one would pick off the cones on which they were feeding. In March, while the ground is still snow-covered, they lay 3-4 pale greenish, spotted eggs in a well-formed nest, 15-30 feet up in a coniferous tree. WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILL _Loxia leucoptera. Case 2, Figs. 51, 52_ Both sexes have white wing-bars and the male is of a paler, more rosy red than the male of the American Crossbill. _Range._ Nests from northern New England to Canada; winters irregularly to southern Illinois and North Carolina. Washington, casual. Ossining, rare T.V., Oct. 29-Dec. 6, Cambridge, irregular W.V. N. Ohio, rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, rare, fall records only, Nov. SE. Minn., W.V., latest record Mch. 4. A rarer bird than the American Crossbill which, however, it resembles in habits. Both climb about the branches of cone-bearing trees like little Parrots, while feeding keep up a low conversational chatter, and take wing with a clicking note. They have been found nesting in Nova Scotia as early as February 6. REDPOLL _Acanthis linaria linaria. Case 2. Figs. 47, 48_ Any little sparrow-like bird with a red cap is a Redpoll. Adult males have the breast also red. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests in Canada and Alaska; winters irregularly south ward to Ohio and Virginia. Washington, very rare and irregular W.V. Ossining, regular W.V., Nov. 25-Mch. 26. Cambridge, irregular W.V., often very abundant, Oct. 25-Apl. 10. N. Ohio, rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, irregular W.V., Nov. 6-Mch. 7. SE. Minn., common W.V., Oct. 31-Apl. 7. A winter visitor from the far North whose coming never can be foretold. Years may pass without seeing them, then late some fall, they may appear in numbers. They are usually in flocks and feed upon seeds as well as birch and alder catkins. In notes and general habits the Redpoll resembles the Goldfinch. Holboell's Redpoll (_A. holboelli_) is a slightly larger race, with a longer, more slender bill. It is a more northern form than the preceding, and rarely visits the United States. The Greater Redpoll (_A. l. rostrata_) is also larger than the common Redpoll, but has a shorter, stouter bill. It nests in Greenland and is of casual occurrence in the northern United States. The Hoary Redpoll (_A. hornemanni exilipes_) is a whiter bird than the preceding with no streaks on the rump and comparatively few on the underparts. It nests within the Arctic Circle and rarely visits the northern United States in winter. Satisfactory identification of these races of the Redpoll can be made only by expert examination of specimens. The field student, however, may call any Redpoll he sees the Common Redpoll with the chances of being right largely in his favor. GOLDFINCH _Astragalinus tristis tristis. Case 2. Figs. 35, 36; Case 4, Figs. 50, 51_ While he wears his 'Goldfinch' costume, the male will be known at a glance, but in winter, when he takes the dull yellow-olive dress of his mate, several glances may be required to recognize him, and this remark, of course, applies to the female at all seasons. L. 5. _Range._ North America; the eastern form nests from Arkansas and northern Georgia to Canada and winters from the Northern to the Gulf States. Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, very common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., P.R., common in summer, uncommon in winter. A beautiful, musical, cheerful bird, as sweet of disposition as he is of voice. To hear a merry troop of Goldfinches singing their spring chorus is to hear the very spirit of the season set to music. Their call-note is a questioning _dearie, dearie_, their flight-call _per-chiÃ©-o-ree, per-chiÃ©-o-ree_, as in long undulations they swing through the air. Their song is suggestive of a Canary's. They are late housekeepers, not nesting before the latter half of June, when 3-6 pale bluish white eggs are laid in a nest warmly lined with plant down. PINE SISKIN _Spinus pinus pinus. Case 2. Fig. 55_ A streaked, sparrow-like bird, with yellow markings in wings and tail which show in flight. L. 5. _Range._ North America; nests from northern New England north to Canada and in the mountains, south to North Carolina; in winter southward to the Gulf States. Washington, irregularly abundant W.V., Oct. 24-May 20. Ossining, irregular P.R. Cambridge, irregular W.V., Oct. 15-May 10; sometimes very abundant; one breeding record. N. Ohio, tolerably common W.V., Sept. 20-May 15. Glen Ellyn, irregular T.V., Apl. 8-May 24; Sept. 8-Nov. 29. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V., and W.V. Oct. 20-Apl. 9. The Siskin belongs in the group of winter visitants whose coming cannot be foretold. Some years it is rare or wanting, others abundant, a flock sometimes, containing several hundred birds. In general habits it resembles the Goldfinch, feeding on weed seeds and catkins, particularly of the alder, and on the seeds of conifers. The call-note is a high _e-eep_; its song like that of the Goldfinch but less musical. SNOW BUNTING _Plectrophanes nivalis nivalis. Case 2, Fig. 57_ The prevailing tone of plumage is white, particularly when the bird is on the wing; the long, hind toe-nail should be noted. L. 6-3/4. _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, winters irregularly south to Kansas and Virginia. Washington, W.V., casual, one instance. Ossining, irregular W.V., Oct. 25-Mch. 22. Cambridge, common W.V., Nov. 1-Mch. 15; abundant in migrations. N. Ohio, tolerably common W.V., Dec. 10-Mch. 15. SE. Minn., common W.V., Oct. 9-Mch. 14. Snow Buntings live in flocks and love open places, such as Horned Larks frequent, and are often found with them in fields or along the shore. Like the Horned Larks they are walkers, not hoppers, and like most walkers, it is exceptional for them to perch in trees. Hoffman described their notes as ""a high, sweet, though slightly mournful _tee_, or _tee-oo_, a sweet rolling whistle, and a harsh _bzz_."" LAPLAND LONGSPUR _Calcarius lapponicus lapponicus_ A sparrow-like bird, with reddish brown wings, a black or blackish breast, white, streaked underparts and a brownish back. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, wintering southward, rarely and irregularly in the Atlantic States, to New York (casually South Carolina) and more commonly in the Mississippi Valley to Ohio and Texas. Washington, W.V. one instance, Dec. Ossining. W.V., casual, Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio, tolerably common W.V., Nov. 15-Apl. 25. Glen Ellyn, common W.V., Oct. 16-May 16. SE. Minn., common W.V. [Illustration: LAPLAND LONGSPUR. Adult male in summer. In winter the throat and breast are mixed black and white.] A rare visitor from the far North who, if we see it at all will probably be found in the company of Horned Larks or Snow Buntings. It is a browner bird than either of them, so while this is not a case of 'birds of a feather' it _is_ a case of birds of a long hind toe-nail, since all three are distinguished by having a toe-nail actually longer than its toe. All three are walkers, which means also that they are ground-birds rather than tree-birds, and the tracks they leave in the snow, or on the beach, distinguish them from other birds if not from each other. VESPER SPARROW _Pooecetes gramineus gramineus. Case 4, Fig. 36; Case 5, Fig. 16_ Paler than any of our other field inhabiting Sparrows, except the Savannah, which is smaller; and differing from them all by having a reddish brown shoulder-patch and white outer tail-feathers. L. 6. _Range._ Nests from North Carolina and Kentucky to Canada; winters from its southern nesting limits to the Gulf States. Washington, P.R., very common T.V., less so in summer and winter. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 2-Nov. 4. Cambridge, common S.R., Apl. 5-Oct. 25. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 20-Nov. 7. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., Mch. 21-Oct. 25. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 1-Oct. 29. A Sparrow of broad fields and plains whose song voices the spirit of open places. Neither words nor musical notation can describe it recognizably. It has somewhat the form of the Song Sparrow's song, just as the two birds resemble each other in form but are unlike in detail. One must, therefore, first learn to know the bird--an easy matter, since it is common and can be readily identified by its white outer tail-feathers--and thereafter you will be the richer for a knowledge of this rarely appealing bit of bird music. The nest, as one might suppose, is built on the ground, and the 4-5 whitish spotted eggs are laid early in May. IPSWICH SPARROW _Passerculus princeps_ With a general resemblance to the Savannah Sparrow (Case 5. Fig. 23) but larger, L. 6-1/4, and decidedly paler. _Range._ Nests on Sable Island off Nova Scotia; winters south, along the coast, regularly to New Jersey; rarely to Georgia. Cambridge, casual, two instances, Oct. Few migratory birds have a more restricted breeding range than the Ipswich Sparrow. Confined to a sandbar island during the summer where it is never out of sight or sound of the sea, it seeks similar haunts during the winter when it is rarely found far from the immediate vicinity of the ocean. In general habits and nesting, it resembles the Savannah Sparrow, of which indeed, it is doubtless an island representative. SAVANNAH SPARROW _Passerculus sandwichensis savanna. Case 4, Fig. 47; Case 5, Fig. 23_ In general color slightly paler than the Vesper Sparrow; smaller than that species; no white tail-feathers; a touch of yellow before the eye and on the bend of the wing. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from Long Island and northern Iowa to Canada; winters from southern New Jersey and southern Indiana southward to Mexico. Washington, abundant T.V., Mch. 20-May 11; Sept. 21-Oct. 23; a few winter. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 3-May 13; Aug. 28-Oct. 28. Cambridge, abundant T.V., Apl., Oct.; breeds sparingly. N. Ohio, not common T.V., Mch. 20-May 12. Glen Ellyn, fairly plentiful S.R., Apl. 8-Oct. 20. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 23. An abundant Sparrow known only to bird students. It prefers fields to door-yards; lives much on the ground, and its darting flight, followed by a sudden dive to cover, and insignificant song all combine to make it rather difficult of identification. It nests in May, laying 4-5 white, speckled eggs in a nest on the ground. GRASSHOPPER SPARROW _Ammodramus savannarum australis. Case 7, Fig. 16_ A small, short-tailed Sparrow, without streaks on the underparts and a back pattern which suggests 'feather scales.' L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Eastern United States, nesting as far north as southern Minnesota, and southern New Hampshire; winters from southern Illinois and North Carolina to the tropics. The Florida Grasshopper Sparrow (_A. s. floridanus_) a smaller, darker race, is resident in the Kissimmee prairies of south central Florida. Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 17-Nov. 20. Ossining common S.R., Apl. 27-Oct. 23. Cambridge, rare S.R., May 16-Sept. 1. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 4-Sept. 13. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 6. Grasshopper, he is called, because his unmusical little song, _pit-tÃºck, zee-e-e-e-e_, sung from a low perch, resembles the sound produced by that insect. He is a common inhabitant of old fields, where sorrel and daisies grow, and when flushed at one's feet darts away to drop suddenly to the ground beyond. The 4-5, white, spotted eggs are laid in a ground nest in late May or early June. HENSLOW'S SPARROW _Passerherbulus henslowi henslowi. Case 7, Fig. 17_ With the general proportions of the Grasshopper Sparrow, but the underparts distinctly streaked and the nape olive. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from southern Missouri and Virginia to central Minnesota and New Hampshire; winters in the Southern States. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 21. Ossining, rare T.V., Oct. 5-Oct. 10. Cambridge, very rare S.R. N. Ohio, S.R., Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 8-Sept. 26. SE. Minn., common S.R. Henslow's Sparrow lives in isolated and sometimes widely separated communities, frequenting wet meadows in summer, but visiting, also, dry fields in winter. It has the general habits of the Grasshopper Sparrow and its notes are equally unmusical. The 4-5 grayish white, thickly speckled eggs are laid in a ground nest the latter half of May. LECONTE'S SPARROW _Passerherbulus lecontei. Case 7, Fig. 18_ The underparts are but slightly streaked, the crown is striped, and the nape reddish brown. L. 5. _Range._ Nesting in the interior of North America from our border States, northward and east to Minnesota; migrates southward and south-eastward, and winters locally from South Carolina to Florida and Texas. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 4-?; Sept. 8-Oct. 6. SE. Minn, uncommon S.R., May 1-Oct. 17. This is the third and rarest member of the trio of small, retiring Sparrows of which the Grasshopper Sparrow is the commonest. It is found east of the Mississippi only in the winter when it may be associated with the Grasshopper and Henslow's Sparrows. SHARP-TAILED SPARROW _Passerherbulus caudacutus. Case 6, Fig. 47_ A buffy Sparrow with the underparts sharply streaked with black. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Salt marshes of the Atlantic coast; nests from Virginia to Massachusetts; winters from New Jersey to Florida. Cambridge, formerly common S.R., but occurs no longer. An abundant inhabitant of salt marshes. There is, or was, a colony on the Hudson River immediately south of the long pier from which Piermont takes its name, but with this exception I have never seen this Sparrow beyond the sound of the surf. It runs about through the thick marsh grasses taking wing only when hard pressed. Its song is short and insignificant. It nests on the ground, the 3-4 grayish white, finely speckled eggs being laid in late May or early June. NELSON'S SHARP-TAILED SPARROW _Passerherbulus nelsoni nelsoni_ Resembles the Sharp-tailed but is smaller and has the throat, breast and sides deeper, very slightly, if at all, streaked with blackish; the upperparts more broadly margined with whitish. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests in the interior from South Dakota northward to Great Slave Lake; migrates south to Texas and southeast through New York and Massachusetts to North Carolina and Florida. Washington, rare T.V., May-Sept. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., Sept. 28-Oct. 17. Cambridge, formerly uncommon T.V. Glen Ellyn, one record, Oct. 2, 1893. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V. This is a fresh-water representative of the Sharp-tail which nests in the prairie sloughs of the interior and reaches the Atlantic coast during its migrations and in the winter. It resembles the Sharp-tail in habits and when on the coast, may be found associated with it. The Acadian Sharp-tailed Sparrow (_P. n. subvirgatus_) is similar to the Sharp-tailed Sparrow but is paler above; the throat, breast and sides are washed with cream-buff and indistinctly streaked with ashy. It nests on the salt marshes of the Atlantic coast from Maine to Cape Breton and in Prince Edward Island; and winters from South Carolina to Florida. In general habits it resembles the two preceding. The three Sharp-tails may be distinguished chiefly by the color and markings of the breast. In the Sharp-tail these are _pale_ buff _distinctly_ streaked with blackish. In Nelson's they are _deep_ buff lightly if at all streaked. In the Acadian they are cream-buff indistinctly streaked with _grayish_. The Sharp-tail may be known from the other two by its distinct black marks below, but the other two cannot certainly be distinguished from each other in life where both may be expected to occur. SEASIDE SPARROW _Passerherbulus maritimus maritimus. Case 6, Fig. 46_ An olive-greenish Sparrow, with a yellow mark before the eye and on the bend of the wing; the underparts _not_ distinctly streaked. L. 6. _Range._ Salt marshes of the Atlantic Coast; nests from Virginia to Massachusetts; winters from Virginia to Georgia. In the Piermont marsh, referred to under the Sharp-tailed Sparrow, there are Seasides as well as Sharp-tails, but this is the only place in which I have seen Seasides away from the sea. There they are abundant in the grassy marshes. Their song is weak and unattractive. Like the Sharp-tail they nest on the ground, laying 3-4 white or bluish white eggs, clouded or finely speckled with cinnamon-brown, the latter part of May. This northern Seaside Finch is migratory, coming the latter part of April and remaining until the latter half of October, but in the South there are several races which for the most part are resident in the same locality throughout the year. Thus we have: Macgillivray's Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. macgillivraii_).--Atlantic Coast from North Carolina south to Matanzas Islet, Florida. Dusky Seaside Sparrow (_P. nigrescens_), an almost black species from Merritt's Island, at the head of Indian River, Florida. Cape Sable Sparrow (_P. m. mirabilis_), Cape Sable, Florida. Scott's Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. peninsulÃ¦_), Gulf Coast of Florida from Tampa to St. Marks; Northwest Florida Sparrow (_P. m. juncicola_) Coast of Florida west of St. Marks; Alabama Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. howelli_), Coast of Alabama and Mississippi. Louisiana Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. fisheri_), Coast of Louisiana to Northeast Texas; and Sennett's Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. sennetti_), Coast of Texas from Galveston at least to Corpus Christi. LARK SPARROW _Chondestes grammacus grammacus. Case 7, Fig. 19_ The chestnut and white head markings and the white-tipped tail-feathers are conspicuous field-marks. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Mississippi Valley; nests from Louisiana to Minnesota and Ohio; winters from Mississippi southward; casual east of the Alleghanies, chiefly in the fall. Washington, A.V., Aug., two captures. N. Ohio, rare S.R., Apl. 28. Glen Ellyn, local and uncommon S.R. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 20-Aug. 2. Few field experiences have given me more pleasure than the discovery near my home at Englewood one November 2, many years ago, of a Lark Finch--one of the 'casuals' which had presumably been carried far from its course by a severe storm of the preceding days. The bird's strongly marked face and conspicuously white-tipped tail-feathers made an impression which testifies to their value as field-characters. In its own range this beautiful Sparrow is a sweet-voiced inhabitant of the fields, nesting on the ground or in low trees and bushes, and laying 3-5 white eggs, spotted and blotched with blackish, in May. HARRIS'S SPARROW _Zonotrichia querula. Case 7, Fig. 21_ A large Sparrow, larger even than the Fox Sparrow; with a pinkish bill, the crown, throat and breast more or less blackish; cheeks buff. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ Interior of North America, nesting in North Carolina; winters from Kansas to Texas; rare east of Wisconsin. Glen Ellyn, one record, May 19. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 6; Sept. 21-Oct. 25. When migrating this Sparrow reminds one of a White-throat. It has a sharp _clink_ note and frequents brier patches and bushy places. WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW _Zonotrichia leucophrys. Case 7, Fig. 22_ Resembles the White-throat but throat gray, like the breast, space before the eye black, not yellow, white in the crown more conspicuous. L. 6-3/4. _Range._ Nests in Canada; winters from Virginia and Ohio to Mexico; not a common migrant in the Atlantic States. Washington, irregularly common W.V. and T.V., May 1-17; Oct. 7-Nov. 20. Ossining, rare T.V., May 9-26; Oct. 3-30. Cambridge, uncommon T.V., May 12-22; Oct. 1-20. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 22-May 20; Sept. 5-Oct. 16. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V.; chiefly spring, Apl. 24-May 31; Oct. 2-21. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 30-; Sept. 26-Oct. 14. This distinguished-looking cousin of our White-throated Sparrow is rare enough in the Eastern States, always to command our attention when we are so fortunate as to meet him. He resembles the White-throat in habits and choice of haunts but his song has a tender, appealing quality, lacking in the White-throat's more cheerful lay, charming as that is. WHITE-THROATED SPARROW _Zonotrichia albicollis. Case 2. Figs. 45, 46; Case 4, Fig. 40_ The adults may be recognized at sight by their white throat, but this character is less prominent and sometimes almost wanting in young birds (Fig. 46) which will require close scrutiny. L. 6-3/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and central Minnesota northward; winters from southern New England and Ohio to the Gulf. Washington, very common W.V., abundant T.V., Mch. 18-May; Sept. 15-Dec. 16. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 10-May 21; Sept. 20-Oct. 30; a few winter. Cambridge, very common T.V., Apl. 25-May 15; Oct. 1-Nov. 10; a few winter. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 1-May 21; Sept. 10-Nov. 7. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 9-May 26; Sept. 13-Nov. 7. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 8-; Sept. 2-Nov. 13. This clear-voiced whistler is known to many persons who have never seen it. When anyone returning from the bird's summer range tells me ""I heard a bird sing like this,"" I know before he whistles a note that he will probably imitate the White-throat. Fortunately the song has so much character and its intervals conform so closely to those of our musical scale, that a recognizable imitation of it is within the power of everyone. There is much variation in the arrangement of the notes and migrants never seem to sing with the power of nesting birds, nor do fall songs compare in volume or execution with those of spring. The call-note is a characteristic sharp _clink_. The White-throat is abundant, migrating and wintering in companies which frequent bushy places, hedgerows and undergrowth generally. The nest is placed on the ground or in bushes in late May or early June. The eggs. 4-5 in number, are bluish white, speckled or blotched with brown. TREE SPARROW _Spizella monticola monticola. Case 2, Fig. 44; Case 4, Fig. 46_ A dusky spot in the center of the breast and a reddish brown cap and streak behind the eye are distinguishing characters. L. 6-1/2. _Range._ Nests in Canada; winters from southern Canada south to Arkansas and South Carolina. Washington, abundant W.V., Oct.-Apl. 1. Ossining, common W.V., Oct. 10-Apl. 27. Cambridge, common W.V., abundant T.V., Oct. 25-Nov. 25; Mch. 20-Apl. 20. N. Ohio, abundant W.V., Oct. 24-May 3. Glen Ellyn, common W.V., Oct. 4-Apl. 28. SE. Minn., common T.V., Oct. 6-May 5; a few winter. From October to April companies of Tree Sparrows harvest the season's crop of weed seeds, feeding usually near woods or hedge-rows to which they go to rest and roost. Their merry chatter is one of the season's most cheerful notes, and in the spring we may hear their canary-like song. CHIPPING SPARROW _Spizella passerina passerina. Case 4, Fig. 45; Case 5, Fig. 31_ In summer, the chestnut cap, black bill, and whitish line over the eye mark the 'Chippy'; but in the fall and winter the crown is like the back, the line over the eye is brownish, and the bill is brown; but the gray rump, shown well in flight, is a good character the year around. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Mississippi to Canada; winters from South Carolina to the Gulf. Washington, common S.R., abundant T.V., Mch. 9-Nov. 11, occasionally winters. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 5-Nov. 7. Cambridge, abundant S.R., Apl. 12-Oct. 25. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 23-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, not very common S.R., Apl. 5-Nov. 5. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 8-Oct. 26. The friendly Chippy is the most familiar and domestic of any of our native Sparrows. He makes tentative visits to our piazzas and, cats permitting, will take up his residence there, building a neat, hair-lined nest in the vines or a nearby bush. Unassuming in voice as he is in manner, his _Chippy-chippy-chippy_, many times repeated, expresses contentment, even if it does not attain high musical rank. Madame Chippy has fine taste in eggs, laying, in early May, little blue gems, beautifully marked with brown or black. CLAY-COLORED SPARROW _Spizella pallida. Case 6, Fig. 48_ The Clay-colored Sparrow resembles a winter Chipping Sparrow, but is paler and has a white line over the eye and a brownish rump. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Interior states east to Illinois; winters from Texas southward. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 26-Oct. 19. A Chipping Sparrow of the Plains which nests on the ground and in low bushes. It is not common east of the Mississippi. FIELD SPARROW _Spizella pusilla pusilla. Case 4, Fig. 43; Case 5, Fig. 14_ The upperparts are brighter reddish brown than in any of our other Sparrows, and the bill is 'pinker.' L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from northern Florida and central Louisiana to Minnesota and Maine; winters from New Jersey and Illinois to the Gulf States. Washington, very common P.R. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 2-Nov. 7. Cambridge, common S.R., Apl. 12-Nov. 1; casual in winter. N. Ohio, abundant in summer, Mch. 6-Oct. 25. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common S.R., Mch. 27-Oct. 11. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 1-Dec. 28. 'Bush Sparrow,' Mr. Roosevelt always called this bird, and the name gives a better conception of its haunts than that of Field Sparrow, since it is found in bush-grown fields. From a bush-top it sings its clearly whistled, sweet, appealing song, varying the relation of notes and trills, but never their musical quality. In a bush also it nests, laying 3-5 white eggs, marked with reddish brown, in May. SLATE-COLORED JUNCO _Junco hyemalis hyemalis. Case 2, Fig. 43; Case 4, Fig. 41_ The plumage of the female is tinged with brownish, but the prevailing tone is slate-gray, unlike that of any of our other Sparrows. The white outer-tail feathers are conspicuously flashed in flight. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and northern New York to Canada and southward in the mountains to Pennsylvania; winters in all the Eastern States. The Carolina Junco (_J. h. carolinensis_), a slightly larger race without a brownish tinge, nests in the higher parts of the Alleghanies from Maryland to northern Georgia, descending to the adjacent lowlands in winter. Washington, abundant W.V., Sept. 26-May 12. Ossining, common W.V., Sept. 19-May 4. Cambridge, rather common W.V., abundant T.V., Sept. 20-Nov. 25; Mch. 20-Apl. 20. N. Ohio, abundant W.V., Oct. 2-May 5. Glen Ellyn, W.V., abundant spring and fall, Aug. 30-May 13, SE, Minn., common T.V., Mch. 4-; Sept. 20-Nov. 12. Gray skies and a snow-covered earth are the Junco colors, and when he flashes them along the hedgerows and wood borders we know that although it is only late September, winter will soon be with us. From that time until April the Junco is of our commonest birds. He visits our food-shelf and roosts in our evergreens, becoming almost as domestic as the Chipping Sparrow. The Junco's call-notes are a sharp _tsip_, a contented _chew-chew-chew_, and a sharp kissing call. Its modest, musical little trill we shall not hear until spring. The nest is built on the ground, and the 4-5 white, speckled, or spotted, eggs are laid late in May. BACHMAN'S SPARROW _PeucÃ¦a Ã¦stivalis bachmani_ With a general resemblance to a Field Sparrow but bill black and larger, cheeks and underparts more buffy, tail shorter, no evident wing bars. _Range._ Southeastern United States from central Georgia to Virginia and from northwestern Florida to central Illinois; winters from North Carolina to northern Florida. Where 'scrub' oaks grow beneath the pines, or post, or white oaks form open woods, there one may look for this rather retiring, sweet-voiced Sparrow. If one can imagine a Hermit Thrush singing the Field Sparrow's chant, he will have some conception of the rare quality of Bachman's Sparrow's song. The nest is built on the ground, the white unmarked eggs being laid early in May. The Pine Woods Sparrow (_P. Ã¦. Ã¦stivalis_), is a darker race, more streaked above with black. It is resident in Florida (except the northwestern part) and southern Georgia where it frequents pine forests undergrown with scrub palmetto. SONG SPARROW _Melospiza melodia melodia. Case 2, Fig. 34; Case 4, Fig. 42_ Streaked below, with a conspicuous spot in the center of the breast. _Range._ Most of North America, the eastern form west to the Rockies, nesting from Virginia and Missouri to Canada and wintering from Illinois and Massachusetts to the Gulf. Washington, common P.R., abundant T.V., Mch. and Oct. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, very abundant S.R., Mch. 10-Nov. 1; locally common W.V. N. Ohio, P.R., abundant in summer, common in winter; Glen Ellyn, common S.R. Feb. 12-Nov. 2. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 16-Nov. 11. If the so-called 'English' Sparrow is the European Sparrow, the Song Sparrow is the American Sparrow. He is found in every State and from the Valley of Mexico to Alaska. He is abundant, musical, and familiar and probably better known than any other member of his family native to this country. His is one of the first birds' songs to be heard in the spring, and the last in the fall, and when in midsummer, the adults, while molting, are silent, the rambling, formless song of the young may be heard. Usually the Song Sparrow is found near water and not far from bushes into which he flies when alarmed. Then we hear his characteristic call-note, an impatient _chimp_, _chimp_, unlike that of any other of our Sparrows. The nest is built on the ground and the 4-5 bluish white brown-marked eggs are laid late in April. LINCOLN'S SPARROW _Melospiza lincolni lincolni. Case 7, Fig. 15_ A broad band of buff across the streaked breast. _Range._ Chiefly western United States; in the East, nests from northern New York and northern Minnesota into Canada; winters from Mississippi to Central America; rare east of the Alleghanies. Washington, rare T.V., May 8-21; Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Ossining, rare T.V., Sept. 29-Oct. 16. Cambridge, not uncommon T.V., May 15-May 25; Sept. 14-Oct. 10. N. Ohio, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 25-May 25. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., fall records only, Sept. 11-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 17-; Sept. 10-Oct. 30. We know the species only as a rare, retiring migrant, frequenting hedgerows, and undergrowth. I have never heard its song while migrating. SWAMP SPARROW _Melospiza georgiana. Case 4, Fig. 44; Case 5, Fig. 22_ Note the bright chestnut cap, grayish, unstreaked breast, and reddish brown rump of the summer plumage; in winter, the crown is darker and streaked with black. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from New Jersey and Illinois to Canada; winters from Nebraska and New Jersey to the Gulf. Washington, very common T.V., Apl. 12-May 19; Sept, 28-Oct. 29; a few winter. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 4-Dec. 2; a few winter. Cambridge, abundant S.R., Apl. 12-Nov. 10; a few winter. N. Ohio, common T.V., Mch. 23-May 20. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 2-May 26; Sept. 2-Oct. 24; possibly S.R. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 5-Nov. 18. The Swamp Sparrow is a Sparrow of the marshes whose _tweet-tweet-tweet_ many times repeated, is associated with the music of Marsh Wrens. It nests on the ground in May, laying eggs not unlike those of the Song Sparrow. FOX SPARROW _Passerella iliaca iliaca. Case 4, Fig. 37; Case 5, Fig. 7_ A large, bright, reddish brown Sparrow, which, because of its red-brown tail, and in spite of its stout bill, is sometimes mistaken for the Hermit Thrush. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ Nests in northern Canada; winters from Ohio and Maryland to the Gulf States. Washington, very abundant T.V., Mch. 13-May 11; Oct. 23-Nov. 15: a few winter. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., Mch. 4-Apl. 20; Oct. 14-Nov. 28. Cambridge, abundant T.V., Mch. 15-Apl. 12; Oct. 20-Nov. 15; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, common T.V., Mch. 12-Apl. 23; Oct. 1-Nov. 16. Glen Ellyn, fairly common T.V., Mch. 11-Apl. 28; Sept. 22-Nov. 8. SE. Minn., common T.V., Mch. 12-; Sept. 17-Nov. 12. A vigorous scratcher in the undergrowth who, using both feet at once, kicks the leaves out behind him; a master musician among our Sparrows whose loud, clear, joyous notes form one of our most notable bird songs. We hear it only for a brief time in spring and fall as the birds pass us on their migration. TOWHEE _Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus. Case 4, Figs. 32, 33; Case 6. Fig. 51_ The female is brown where the male is black; both are unmistakable L. 8-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern Georgia and central Kansas; winters from Ohio and Potomac Valleys to the Gulf. Washington, common S.R., very common T.V., Apl. 5-Oct. 21; a few winter. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 21-Oct. 31. Cambridge, common S.R., Apl. 25-Oct. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 10-Oct. 25. Glen Ellyn, not common, S.R., Mch. 30-Nov. 18, SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 11-Nov. 8. _Chewi['n]k, towheÃ©_, the clear, emphatic, strongly accented call announces the presence of a bird whose colors are as distinctive as its notes. The Towhee feeds on the ground in and near bushy places, but when the desire to sing comes upon him he leaves his lowly haunts and taking a more or less exposed perch, fifteen to twenty feet from the ground, utters his _sweet-bird-sin-n-n-g_, with an earnestness which goes far to atone for his lack of striking musical ability. The nest is built on the ground and the 4-5 white, finely speckled eggs are laid during the first half of May. The White-eyed Towhee (_P. e. alleni_) of Florida and the coast region north to Charleston, South Carolina, has the eye yellowish instead of red and the white markings are more restricted. Its call is higher than that of the northern bird and its song shorter. CARDINAL _Cardinalis cardinalis cardinalis. Case 4, Figs. 34, 35._ The male, with his conspicuous crest and bright colors, can be confused with no other species; the female is much duller and the crest is less prominent but still evident. L. 8-1/4. _Range._ Resident from the Gulf States to southern New York and northern Ohio; rarely found further north. Washington, common P.R.; less common than formerly. Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, irregular but not very infrequent at all seasons. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare S.R. SE. Minn., rare. Next to the Mockingbird's medley, the rich, mellow whistle of the Cardinal is the most prominent bird voice in the choir of southern songsters. Passing most of the time in the undergrowth, where, in spite of his brilliant colors, he readily conceals himself, he makes no attempt, when singing, to hide his fiery plumes, but selecting a conspicuous perch, challenges the attention of the world. The female Cardinal also sings, but her song has much less volume than that of her mate, and is more rarely heard. The call-note of both sexes is a minute; sharp, _cheep_, which one would attribute to a bird half their size. The Cardinal nests in bushes, laying 3-4 whitish eggs speckled and spotted with brown, in April. The Florida Cardinal (_C. c. floridanus_), a slightly smaller, deeper colored (especially in the female) race of the preceding, inhabits the peninsula of Florida. BLUE GROSBEAK _Guiraca cÃ¦rulea cÃ¦rulea. Case 6, Figs. 52, 53_ Should be confused only with the Indigo Bunting, but it is larger and the male is darker and has brown wing-bars. L. 7. _Range._ Nests from Florida to Maryland and southern Illinois; winters in the tropics, uncommon east of the Alleghanies. Washington, very uncommon, S.R., May 1-Sept. 20. Cambridge, A.V., one instance, May. The Blue Grosbeak is an unfamiliar bird to most eastern students. Ridgway states that its haunts resemble those of the Field Sparrow or Indigo Bunting. Its call is a strong, harsh _ptchick_, its song a beautiful, but rather feeble warble. The nest is usually built in bushes and the 3-4 pale bluish white eggs are laid in May. ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK _Zamelodia ludoviciana. Case 7, Figs. 25, 26_ The male needs no introduction; the streaked plumage of the female betrays her Sparrow ancestry; the white stripe over her eye is a conspicuous mark. Young males in the fall resemble the female, but have a rose-tinted breast. L. 8. _Range._ Nests from central Kansas and central New Jersey north to Canada, and, in the mountains, south to northern Georgia; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather common T.V., May 1-30; Aug. 29-Oct. 6. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., May 3-Oct. 1. Cambridge, very common S.R., May 10-Sept. 10. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., common T.V., Apl. 27-Sept. 28. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 23. Distinguished alike by plumage and song, the Rose-breast is one of our most notable bird citizens. His song resembles in form that of the Robin, but has a more lyrical, flowing, joyous quality, and, unlike the Robin, he often sings while flying. The call-note of both sexes is a sharp _peek_ which, like the Cardinal's _cheep_, seems too small for the bird. The Rose-breast lives and nests in woodland, particularly second-growths, building a frail nest ten to twenty feet from the ground. The 4-5 blue, brown-marked eggs are laid the latter half of May. INDIGO BUNTING _Passerina cyanea. Case 7, Figs. 23, 24_ The male, well seen, is unmistakable. The female is very 'sparrowy' and, unless one gets a suggestion of blue in her plumage, can best be identified by her unsparrow-like, sharp _pit_. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Louisiana to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 9. Ossining, common S.R., May 4-Oct. 17. Cambridge, common S.R., May 15-Oct. 1. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 26-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., May 1-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., common S.R. Apl. 28-Oct. 2. ""July, July, summer-summer's here; morning, noontide, evening, list to me"" the Indigo sings in rather hard but brilliant little voice. To me the words express the rhythm as well as the spirit of the song. We hear them most often in bushy fields and open second-growths, along hedge-rows or from briery clumps in which the bird's nest may be hidden. The pale, bluish white eggs are laid the latter half of May. PAINTED BUNTING _Passerina ciris. Case 6, Figs. 49, 50_ The male is one of our most brilliantly colored birds, the female has the color of a Vireo but the bill of a Sparrow. _Range._ Southern States north to southeastern North Carolina and southern Kansas; winters from southern Florida southward. ""Painted"" Bunting he is called, but the brilliancy and luster of his plumage were not painted by human hands. 'Nonpareil' he has also been named, and, in the eastern United States, at least, he is without equal in the brightness of his colors. The bird's haunts are not unlike those of the Indigo Bunting, and its song is said to resemble the Indigo's but to be more feeble. It builds in bushes and low trees, laying 3-4 bluish white, brown-spotted eggs in May. DICKCISSEL _Spiza americana. Case 7, Fig. 20_ The yellow on the breast and, in the male, black crescent will distinguish this species from all its Sparrow kin. L. 6. _Range._ Chiefly prairies of the Mississippi Valley, from Texas and Mississippi north to Minnesota and southern Ontario; now rare east of the Alleghanies. Washington, formerly ""very abundant,"" now seen only occasionally, May-Aug. Cambridge, casual, found nesting at Medford, June 9. 1877, where several birds were observed; not uncommon in 1833-34 (see Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, III, 1878, 45. 190). N. Ohio, rare S.R., May 1. Glen Ellyn, rather rare and local S.R., formerly common. May 3-Sept. 5. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 11-Aug. 20. The Dickcissel is a bird of the fields who, from a weed-stalk or fence by the wayside, sings his unmusical _dick-dick cissel, cissel, cissel_. The nest is built on the ground or in a bush and the 4-5 pale blue eggs are laid the latter half of May. TANAGERS. FAMILY TANGARIDÃ SCARLET TANAGER _Piranga erythromelas. Case 7, Figs. 27, 28_ The black wings and tail of the male will distinguish him from our other two red birds--the Cardinal and Summer Tanager. The olive-green female may be known from all our other olive-green birds by her larger size. L. 7-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern Georgia and southern Kansas to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common T.V., less common S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 15. Ossining, common S.R., May 4-Oct. 9. Cambridge, rather common S.R., May 12-Oct. 1. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 28-Oct. 2. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 29. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 11. As a family Tanagers are the most strikingly colored of American birds, but among the nearly 400 species none appears more brilliant in life than the male Scarlet Tanager. The leaf-colored female is as difficult to see as the male is conspicuous. Both have the same characteristic call--_chip-chÃºrr, chip-chÃºrr_. The song suggests a Robin's but is more forced and has a hoarse undertone. They live and nest in the woods, building on a horizontal limb 10-20 feet up. The 3-4 greenish blue, brown-marked eggs are laid late in May. SUMMER TANAGER _Piranga rubra rubra. Case 5, Figs. 33, 34_ The male is usually red like the Cardinal, but lacks the Cardinal's crest; the female is more yellow than the female of the Scarlet Tanager. _Range._ Southern States; nesting north to Maryland and Illinois; winters in the tropics. Washington, uncommon S.R., Apl. 18-Sept. 19. Cambridge, one record. The ""Summer Redbird's"" _chicky-tucky-tuck_, is as clearly pronounced and unmistakable as the Scarlet Tanager's _chip-chÃºrr_. Its song is somewhat sweeter than that of its scarlet cousin, but bears a general resemblance to it. Both pine and deciduous woods are inhabited by this bird. Its nesting habits resemble those of the Scarlet Tanager. SWALLOWS. FAMILY HIRUNDINIDÃ PURPLE MARTIN _Progne subis subis. Case 5, Fig. 25_ Largest of our Swallows. The female is duller above than the male, and below is brownish gray. L. 8. _Range._ Nests locally from the Gulf to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 1-Sept. 14. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 11. Cambridge, formerly locally common S.R., Apl. 20-Aug. 25. N. Ohio, common S.R. Apl. 1-Sept. 5. Glen Ellyn, local S.R., Mch. 23-Sept. 10. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 1-Sept. 9. Fortunate is the man whose hospitality the Martins accept. Their cheery notes and sociability make them the best kind of guests. The Audubon Society will send one plans for a Martin house, and tell one where to place it. Martins nest in May and lay white eggs. CLIFF SWALLOW _Petrochelidon lunifrons lunifrons. Case 6, Fig. 55_ The rusty rump is distinctive. L. 6. _Range._ Nests locally from Georgia to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, rare S.R., Apl. 10-Sept.--? Ossining, common S.R., May 1-Sept. 12. Cambridge, S.R., much less than formerly. Apl. 28-Aug. 25. N. Ohio, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 6-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, not common, local S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 16. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 13-Sept. 12. Cliff Swallow it is in the West, but ""Eave"" Swallow it should be in the East where the rows of flask-shaped mud nests cluster thick beneath projecting roofs. They prefer unpainted buildings and the modern barn rarely knows them. The white, brown-spotted eggs are laid in the latter half of May. BARN SWALLOW _Hirundo erythrogaster. Case 5, Fig. 32_ Chestnut underparts and a forked tail are the chief characters of this beautiful Swallow. L. 7. _Range._ Nests from North Carolina and Arkansas to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., more abundant T.V., Mch. 30-Sept. 17. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 15-Sept. 22. Cambridge, common S.R., but fast decreasing, Apl. 20-Sept. 10. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 30-Sept. 22. Glen Ellyn, S.R., fairly common and increasing. Apl. 7-Sept. 1. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 28-Aug. 31. Barn Swallows are far more beautiful, more graceful and more companionable than Purple Martins. But while we are erecting special dwellings for the Martins we are making our barns Swallow-proof. A pair of Barn Swallows are not only cheerful neighbors but good investments. Let us make it possible for them to enter the hay-mow. We may even supply shelves as foundations for their open mud nests. The white, spotted eggs are laid in the latter half of May. TREE SWALLOW _Iridoprocne bicolor. Case 5, Fig. 24_ Silky white below and shining bluish green above; young birds are mouse-colored above but below are snowy white, unmarked, as in the adult. L. 6. _Range._ Nests chiefly from southern New England northward and winters from South Carolina to Central America. Washington, common T.V., Mch. 26-May 26; July 8-Oct. 14. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 4-May 26; Aug. 4-Oct. 16. Cambridge, S.R., formerly common, now common only as a migrant, Apl. 5-Oct. 8. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 10-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., rare S.R., Apl. 21-Sept. 8. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 30-Aug. 31. We see comparatively few Tree Swallows during the spring, but from July to October, as they journey slowly southward, they are the most abundant members of their family. In countless thousands long ropes of Swallows crowd the wayside wires from pole to pole. At night, with others of their tribe, they roost in the marshes. Tree Swallows they are called because they nest in hollow trees and, like some other hole-nesting birds, they may be induced to occupy nesting-boxes, making a welcome addition to our list of bird tenants. The 4-7 white eggs are laid in May. BANK SWALLOW _Riparia riparia. Case 6. Fig. 54_ Note the small size, dull plumage, and breast-band. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ A native of the Old World as well as of the New. In North America nesting from Louisiana and Virginia nearly to the Arctic Circle; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., more common T.V., Apl. 13-Sept. 19. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 18-Oct. 1. Cambridge, formerly common S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 1; common T.V. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 6-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn, fairly common T.V.; a few S.R., Apl. 22-Sept. 3. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 10-Sept. 25. The Bank Swallow is a bird of the air who tunnels the earth for a nesting-place. Where river or road has left a bank, its face may be dotted with the entrances to the Bank Swallow's dwellings. At the end of two or three feet the nest of grass and feathers is placed, fit receptacle for the pearl-white eggs, which are usually laid the latter half of May. During the migrations the Bank Swallow travels with other members of its family, sharing their roost in the marshes by night and their wayside perch by day. ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOW _Stelgidopteryx serripennis. Case 6, Fig. 56_ With the general appearance of the Bank Swallow, but slightly larger, grayer below, and with no breast-band. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf States north to Massachusetts and Minnesota: winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 2-Sept. 3. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 17-Aug. 12. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 15-Sept. 20. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 14-Aug. 26. Least common of our Swallows. It nests in small colonies of about half a dozen pairs, sometimes in holes, at others under bridges, crevices in cliffs and similar situations. In the fall, it flocks with other species of its family. Its 4-8 white eggs are laid the latter half of May. WAXWINGS. FAMILY BOMBYCILLIDÃ BOHEMIAN WAXWING _Bombycilla garrula_ Similar to the Cedar Waxwing, but larger, the primary coverts and secondaries tipped with white, the primaries tipped with white or yellow, the under tail-coverts chestnut. L. 8. _Range._ Western Canada; in winter east to Minnesota and rarely as far as Connecticut. Glen Ellyn, one record, Jan. 22, 1908. SE. Minn., irregular W.V., until Apl. 1. There are comparatively few authentic records of this beautiful bird east of the Alleghanies. Enthusiastic bird-students are, I fear, apt to give Waxwings, seen in winter, the benefit of the doubt and call them 'Bohemians.' Look especially for the white marks on the Bohemian's wings. Its large size might not be apparent unless the two species were seen together. CEDAR WAXWING _Bombycilla cedrorum. Case 2, Fig. 40; Case 4, Fig. 54_ Crest usually conspicuous; tail tipped with yellow; a black 'bridle.' _Range._ Nests from North Carolina and Kansas to Canada; winters irregularly throughout the United States. Washington, very common P.R., less so in winter. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, not common P.R., common S.R., abundant T.V. in spring, Feb. 1-Apl. 25. N. Ohio, irregularly common in summer. Glen Ellyn. S.R., Jan. 21-Sept. 24; occasional W.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Feb. 25-Sept. 28. A Waxwing's crest is as expressive as a horse's ears. One moment it points skyward the next it flattens and disappears. They are as sociable as ""Love Birds,"" traveling in small flocks which, like one bird, dive into a tree and perch so close together that often several will be almost touching, and with common accord they take wing. They feed mainly on small fruit both wild and cultivated but are also expert flycatchers. They nest in June, usually in shade or fruit trees, building a well-made nest for the beautiful, clay-colored, black-spotted eggs. SHRIKES. FAMILY LANIIDÃ NORTHERN SHRIKE _Lanius borealis. Case 2, Fig. 56_ Larger than the Migrant and Loggerhead Shrikes with a grayish, not black, forehead and a lightly barred, not plain white breast. L. 10-1/4. _Range._ Nests in Canada, winters south to Texas and Virginia. Washington, rare and irregular W.V., Oct.-Feb. Ossining, tolerably common W.V., Oct. 26-Apl. 17. Cambridge, common W.V., Nov. 1-Apl. 1. N. Ohio, not common W.V., Nov. 6-Apl. 3. Glen Ellyn, not common W.V., Oct. 24-June 5. SE. Minn., common W.V., Oct. 17-Mch. 28. A grim, gray bird that comes out of the far North in the fall. His mission is death to birds and mice and he makes no attempt to disguise it but boldly advertises his presence by perching where he may be seen as well as see. Mice he can plunge on, but Sparrows, Siskins or Redpolls he may have to pursue on the wing, following every twist and turn until he reaches striking distance. Slowly he bears his victim, in his feet, to some tree there to hang it on thorn or in crotch from which it may be devoured at leisure. An executioner by birth, the Shrike or ""Butcher Bird"" evidently pursues his calling with no regrets and when spring time approaches adds his voice to the chorus of bird song. LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE _Lanius ludovicianus ludovicianus. Case 4, Fig. 55_ A gray bird with black wings and tail marked with white which shows in flight; smaller than the Northern Shrike with a black forehead and unmarked breast. L. 9. _Range._ Florida north to North Carolina, west to Louisiana. The Loggerhead has the general habits of his larger northern cousin the ""Butcher-bird,"" but he feeds, as a rule, on smaller game. Grasshoppers and lizards form the larger part of his fare and the barbed wire fences not infrequently are his shambles. A flight is ended by an upward swing to the chosen perch which may be a tree-top, a telegraph wire, or lightning-rod tip. From such a lookout he keeps a sharp watch for his prey, which he detects at surprisingly long distances; meanwhile uttering the gurgles, squeaks and pipes which constitute his song. The nest is built in hedges or low trees in early March. The 3-5 eggs are dull white thickly marked with brown and lavender. The Migrant Shrike (_Lanius ludovicianus migrans_) is a northern race of the Loggerhead from which it differs only in being somewhat paler above and grayer below. It is a Summer Resident from Kansas and western North Carolina to Minnesota and Maine and winters from the Middle States southward. Generally speaking, it may be said that any Shrike found north of Maryland in the winter is a Northern Shrike; that any Shrike found north of Virginia in the summer is a Migrant Shrike, and that any Shrike found south of that state in the summer is a Loggerhead. VIREOS. FAMILY VIREONIDÃ BLACK-WHISKERED VIREO _Vireosylva calidris barbatula_ Resembles the Red-eyed Vireo but has a dusky streak on each side of the throat. _Range._ Cuba and Bahamas, north in spring to southern Florida. This is a tropical species which reaches southern Florida early in May and returns to its winter home after nesting. In general habits and notes it resembles the Red-eye. RED-EYED VIREO _Vireosylva olivasceus. Case 6, Fig. 66_ An olive-green bird, silky white below, a white line, bordered by black over the red eye, a grayish cap and no white band on the wings. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 21-Oct. 17. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 19. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 10-Sept. 10. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Apl. 27-Oct. 1. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., May 5-Oct. 5. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 5-Sept. 15. A tireless soliloquist, the Red-eyed Vireo repeats from our shade and fruit trees in endless succession the broken phrases of his monotonous, rambling recitation. He sings all day and he sings throughout the summer, pausing only to sleep or to swallow the caterpillar he hunts while singing. Patient, persistent mediocrity is expressed by the Red-eye's song, and only his nasal, petulant call-note, _whang_, suggests that he is not altogether satisfied with life as he finds it. The nest, like that of our other Vireos, is a deep cup hung from between a crotch from 5 to about 40 feet above the ground. The 3-4 eggs, which are laid in late May, are white spotted with reddish brown. WARBLING VIREO _Vireosylva gilva gilva. Case 7, Fig. 29_ Smaller than the Red-eye, without black and white lines over the brown eye, the underparts faintly tinged with yellowish. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from Louisiana and North Carolina to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 21-Sept. 12. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., May 3-Sept. 18. Cambridge, locally common S.R., May 5-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 3-Sept. 15. While the Red-eye's song lasts the greater part of the day, the Warbling Vireo's continues for only about four seconds, then, after an interval, it is repeated. It is an unbroken strain running up and down the middle of the scale and has it in a reminder of the Purple Finch's lay. This species is less generally distributed than the Red-eye. It may be common in one locality and absent from another. Its nesting habits and eggs are much like those of the Red-eye, but the male has the singular custom of singing while it sits upon the nest. PHILADELPHIA VIREO _Vireosylva philadelphicus. Case 7, Fig. 30_ A small, olive-green Vireo, with pale yellow underparts and a whitish line over the eye. L. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and northern Michigan into Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, very rare T.V., May; Sept. Ossining, rare T.V., Sept. 20-Oct. 20. Cambridge, rare T.V. Glen Ellyn, rather rare T.V., May 14, 15; Aug. 21-Sept. 30. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V., May 9. Rarest of our Vireos; but few students know it as a migrant and fewer still as a nesting bird. Its song and nesting habits resemble those of the Red-eye. YELLOW-THROATED VIREO _Lanivireo flavifrons. Case 6, Fig. 69_ Breast bright yellow; a yellow ring around the eye, two white wing-bands, bill rather stout. L. 6. _Range._ Nests from Florida and Texas to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 19-Sept. 29. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 7. Cambridge, commons S.R., May 6-Sept. 10. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 2-Sept. 26. SE Minn., common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 15. A less common bird than the Red-eye, but like it generally distributed through woodland, garden and orchard. It's song resembles the Red-eye's in form but is richer in tone, more deliberately uttered, and not continuous. ""See me--I'm here--where are you?"" he seems to say, and after a pause repeats the query. The nest has the deep cup-shape of our other Vireo's but is externally covered with lichens. The eggs, laid the latter part of May, are white with a few specks of black or brown. BLUE-HEADED VIREO _Lanivireo solitarius solitarius. Case 6, Fig. 68_ Eye-ring and lores white, head grayish blue, underparts white, the sides yellowish; two wing-bars. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from the mountains of northern New Jersey and of Pennsylvania to Canada; winters from the Gulf States southward. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 6-May 18; Sept. 6-Nov. 3. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 23-May 14; Sept. 8-Oct. 20. Cambridge, common T.V., rare S.R., Apl. 20-May 8; Sept. 15-Oct. 5. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 17-May 20; Sept. 1-30. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 9-19; Aug. 11-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 3-Sept. 28. We know this Vireo chiefly as a migrant, one of the earliest of the group of small arboreal wood-haunting birds (Vireos and Warblers) to reach us in the spring. Its song, as well as its movements, are deliberate. Vireo-like it peers beneath the leaves or inspects the blossoms, removing a caterpillar here or an insect's egg there, the while singing leisurely a rich-toned rendering of the Red-eye's theme. It nests late in May, hanging its cup-shaped basket to a crotch usually five to ten feet above the ground. The eggs are white with a few black or brown spots. The Mountain Solitary Vireo (_L. s. alticola_) has a slightly larger bill and bluer back. It nests in the mountains from Maryland to Georgia and winters southward to Florida. WHITE-EYED VIREO _Vireo griseus griseus. Case 6, Fig. 67_ White or yellowish white eyes; whitish underparts, washed with yellow on the sides. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Florida and Texas to Wisconsin and Massachusetts; winters from South Carolina to the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 18-Oct. 19. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 3. Cambridge, rare S.R., May 8-Sept. 20; formerly common. Glen Ellyn, rare, spring only, May 24-June 5. An inhabitant of bushy undergrowths whose snappy calls possess almost the character of human speech, so clearly and emphatically are the syllables enunciated. One's presence seems to excite both his curiosity and his disapproval, for he looks one over from this side and that all the while giving expression to remarks which sound far from complimentary. The nest is hung from a crotch, rarely more than 6 feet from the ground. The eggs laid in April, in the South, in May in the North, are white with a few blackish spots. The Key West Vireo (_V. g. maynardi_) has a longer bill and is somewhat paler below than the White-eye. It is resident in southern Florida and the Keys. BELL'S VIREO _Vireo belli belli. Case 6, Fig. 65_ Smallest of our Vireos; crown ashy, lores and eye-ring whitish. L. 4-3/4. _Range._ Mississippi Valley; nests from Texas to northwestern Indiana and South Dakota; winters in the tropics. Resembles the White-eye in habits, notes, and choice of haunts, but, according to Goss, its notes are not so harsh and emphatic. WOOD WARBLERS. FAMILY MNIOTILTIDÃ BLACK AND WHITE WARBLER _Mniotilta varia. Case 6, Fig. 57_ The female is less conspicuously striped than the male, but both are quite unlike any of our other birds. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Louisiana to Canada; winters from Florida southward. Washington, abundant T.V., less common S.R., Apl. 8-Oct. 18. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 18-Oct. 1. Cambridge, very common S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 5. N. Ohio, common T.V., a few S.R., Apl. 22-Sept. 26. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 28-May 28; Aug. 11-Sept. 27. SE. Minn., common T.V., uncommon S.R., Apl. 23-Oct. 12. This species and the three Nuthatches are our only birds that creep down as well as up; but the Nuthatches wear no body stripes and are otherwise too unlike the Creeper to be confused with him. The Downy Woodpecker 'hitches' himself upward advancing by jerks; the Brown Creeper, true to its name, _creeps_. The nest is built on the ground and the white, brown-marked eggs are laid in April in the South, in May in the North. PROTHONOTARY WARBLER _Protonotaria citrea. Case 5, Fig. 29_ The female is duller than the male, but is too like him to be mistaken for the mate of any other Warbler, while he is in a class by himself. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Florida to Delaware and southeastern Minnesota; winters in the tropics. Washington, of irregular occurrence in May. N. Ohio, one record, May 9. Glen Ellyn, rare, spring only, May 13-15. SE. Minn., common S.R., of Mississippi bottoms, May 7-Aug. 16. No description or illustration prepares one for the gleaming beauty of the Golden Swamp Warbler. Cypress swamps or willow-bordered sloughs, where it may nest in the opening in old stubs, are its chosen haunts, and in such places it is sometimes found in numbers. The white eggs, thickly marked with brown, are laid in May. SWAINSON'S WARBLER _Helinaia swainsoni. Case 5, Fig. 28_ No wing-bars, plain brown above, white below. L. 5. _Range._ In summer from Florida and Louisiana north to southern Illinois and southeastern Virginia; winters in the tropics. Comparatively few bird students have seen this retiring Warbler in its haunts. ""Water, tangled thickets, patches of cane, and a rank growth of semi-aquatic plants,"" Brewster states, seem indispensable to its existence. Its song in general effect, the same writer says, recalls that of the Northern Water-Thrush. The nest is built in bushes, canes, etc., and the white eggs are laid in May. WORM-EATING WARBLER _Helmitheros vermivorus. Case 7, Fig. 31_ Head striped with black and buff; body unstreaked, no wing-bars. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from South Carolina and Missouri to Connecticut and Iowa; winters in the tropics. Washington, quite common S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 15. Ossining, common S.R., May 7-Aug. 23. Cambridge, A.V., one instance, Sept. Comparatively few bird students can claim close acquaintance with this slow-moving, dull-colored bird who lives on or near the ground, usually in dry woodlands. Its song, resembling that of the Chipping Sparrow, will attract only an attentive ear, while its local distribution further prevents it from being more commonly known. It nests on the ground, the white, brown-marked eggs being laid in May. BACHMAN'S WARBLER _Vermivora bachmani. Case 5, Figs. 20, 21_ All but the central pair of feathers with white spots near the end; no wing-bars; size small, the bill sharply pointed and slightly decurved. L. 4-1/2. _Range._ In summer known from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas and Missouri; in winter recorded only from Cuba. When migrating, this little-known species associates with other bird travelers and may be found high or low. When nesting, it frequents swampy woods and, although it usually sings from the tree-tops, it builds in bushes within a few feet of the ground, laying 3-4 white eggs in the latter half of April or in May. Its song has been compared to that of both the Parula Warbler and the Chipping Sparrow. BLUE-WINGED WARBLER _Vermivora pinus. Case 7, Fig. 35_ Outer tail-feathers white near the end; two white wing-bars; female duller than the male. _Range._ Nests from Missouri and Virginia north to Minnesota and Connecticut; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather uncommon T.V., Apl. 26-May 22; Aug. 13-Sept. 2; a few breed. Ossining, common S.R., May 4-Sept. 7. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, irregular, possibly S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 1. In second growths, among birches, and at the border of the woods one may hear the wheezy, lazy, _swee-chee_ of the Blue-wing. I make it a rule to see the singer always with the hope that he may prove to be the rare Brewster's Warbler, which usually sings like the Blue-wing, but in color is nearer the Golden-wing, being, in fact, like the Golden-wing but with the underparts and cheeks white unmarked with black. It appears to be a hybrid between the Blue-wing and Golden-wing. (Case 7, Fig. 38.) A much rarer supposed hybrid between these two Warblers is known as Lawrence's Warbler. It is yellow below, like the Blue-wing, but has the black throat and cheeks of the Golden-wing. Some individuals sing like the Blue-wing, others like the Golden-wing, and this is true also of Brewster's Warbler. (Case 7, Fig. 37.) The Blue-wing nests on the ground, laying 4-5 white delicately speckled eggs the latter part of May. GOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER _Vermivora chrysoptera. Case 7, Figs. 34, 36_ A gray bird with a yellow patch on the wings and a black or blackish breast. _Range._ Nests from northern New Jersey and southern Iowa north to Massachusetts and central Minnesota and south in the mountains to northern Georgia; winters in the tropics. Washington, uncommon, T.V., May 1-30; Aug. 8-21. Ossining, rare S.R., May 8-Aug. 25. Cambridge, rather common S.R., May 12-Aug. 25. N. Ohio, rare T.V., Glen Ellyn, irregular, not common T.V., May 4-18; Aug. 16-Sept. 24. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 5-Sept. 9. The Golden-wing's _zee-zee-zee-zee_ resembles the Blue-wing's song in tone but the syllables are all on one note. When nesting, the Golden-wing prefers second growths, and birches, but when migrating it may be found in the woods with others of its family. The nest is made on the ground, and the eggs, which resemble those of the Blue-wing, but are more heavily marked, are laid in May or early June. NASHVILLE WARBLER _Vermivora rubricapilla rubricapilla. Case 7, Fig. 33_ No wing-bars or white in the tail; adult with a partly concealed chestnut patch in the gray crown; eye-ring white. L. 4-3/4. _Range._ Nests from northern Pennsylvania and Nebraska to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, uncommon T.V., Apl. 28-May 19; Sept. 5-Oct. 2. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 7-27; Aug. 11-Oct. 4; may breed. Cambridge, rather common S.R., May 5-Sept. 15; abundant T.V. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 28-May 27; Sept. 1-Oct. 16. Glen Ellyn, regular T.V., Apl. 27-May 25; Aug. 20-Oct. 19. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 1-Sept. 29. Thayer in ""Warblers of North America"" says that the Nashville is one of the most agile and restless of the gleaning Warblers. It prefers birches, but is found in rather open growths of other trees. Its commoner song consists of a string of six or eight or more lively rapid notes, running into a rolling twitter. It has also a flight-song. The nest is placed on the ground; the eggs, which are laid in May or early June, are white, spotted with reddish brown. ORANGE-CROWNED WARBLER _Vermivora celata celata. Case 7, Fig. 32_ A dusky, olive-green bird, obscurely streaked below; without wing-bars or white patches in tail. L. 5. _Range._ Chiefly the interior, nests from Manitoba northward; winters in Florida and the Gulf States. Washington, casual T.V., two records, Oct. Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, rare T.V., in fall. Oct. 5-Nov. 15. N. Ohio, rare T.V., Apl. 27-May 21. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 1-21; July 28-Oct. 7. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 25-; Aug. 18-Oct. 16. The Orange-crown is a rare fall migrant in the North Atlantic States, but common in Florida and southern Georgia in the winter. It frequents the upper branches of trees though, as with most members of its genus, it nests on the ground. Its call-note is a sharp, characteristic _chip_; its song is said to resemble that of the Chipping Sparrow. TENNESSEE WARBLER _Vermivora peregrina. Case 8, Fig. 64_ Adult male in spring with a grayish blue crown and white underparts; female and young bright olive-green above, yellowish below; no wing-bars. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from northern New England northward; winters in the tropics. Washington, T.V., rare in May; occasionally common, Aug. 31-Nov. 30. Ossining, rare T.V., May 22-27; Aug. 22-Oct. 2. Cambridge, rare T.V., May 15-25; Sept. N. Ohio, common T.V., May 4-25; Sept. 10-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 30-June 6; July 29-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 30-; Sept. 30-. A dull-colored little Warbler which we know as a rather rare migrant, associated with the traveling companies of its family on their northward and southward journeys. The song is described by Mrs. Farwell as noticeable but not musical and resembling that of the Chipping Sparrow. NORTHERN PARULA WARBLER _Compsothlypis americana usneÃ¦. Case 7, Fig. 39_ A small, bluish Warbler with a yellow patch on the back, a dark band on the breast, and white wing-bars. L. 4-3/4. _Range._ Nests from Virginia and Louisiana to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, T.V., but dates not distinguishable from those of _americana_. Ossining, common T.V., May 2-28; Sept. 21-Oct. 7. Cambridge, common T.V., May 1-28; Sept. 10-30. N. Ohio, not common T.V., May 1-18. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 3-28; Aug. 25-Oct. 1. SE. Minn., common T. V., May 5-Sept. 9. A common migrant, traveling with other Wood Warblers, but in summer usually restricted to swampy localities where usnea moss flourishes. Of, or rather _in_ this, it makes its nest, laying 4-5 white, brown-marked eggs the latter half of May. To describe its song as several wheezy notes running into a little trill, conveys no idea of pleasing character. It is easily recognized and, in time, acquires associations with what, to bird-lovers, is the most delightful season of the year. The Southern Parula Warbler (_C. a. americana_) is a slightly smaller race with less black about the lores and on the breast in the male. It summers in the Southeastern States north to Virginia, and winters in the tropics. Its habits resemble those of the northern race, but it nests in the hanging, gray tillandsia or Spanish 'moss' instead of in usnea. CAPE MAY WARBLER _Dendroica tigrina. Case 8, Figs. 65, 66_ Male with chestnut cheek-patches and a white patch on the wing; female and young streaked below, the rump more yellow than the back; tail-feathers with terminal spots. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from northern New England northward; winters in the tropics. Washington, sometimes very common, usually uncommon T.V., May 1-20; Aug. 4-Oct. 17. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., Aug. 20-Oct. 1. Cambridge, rare T.V., May 15-25; Aug. 25. N. Ohio, not common T.V., May 4-18. Glen Ellyn, irregular T.V., Apl. 30-May 21; Sept. 8-15. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 8. This beautiful Warbler was formerly considered one of our rarer migrants, but of recent years it appears to be increasing in numbers. On its nesting ground the bird is said to frequent the upper branches of tall evergreens (though one of the few nests which has been found was within three feet of the ground), but when migrating it may be found in the trees of lawns, orchards, and woodland and I have seen it among poke-berries. The Cape May's song is a thin squeak which is compared to the songs of the Black and White and also Blackpoll Warblers. YELLOW WARBLER _Dendroica Ã¦stiva Ã¦stiva. Case 8, Figs. 40, 41_ A small yellow bird streaked below with brownish; inner webs of tail-feathers yellow. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from Missouri and South Carolina to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., abundant T.V., Apl. 4-Sept. 28. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 27. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Apl. 14-Sept. 10. Glen Ellyn, not very common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 10. Show me willows over water and any day in May or June I'll show you a Yellow Warbler. Shade and fruit trees also attract him and he may build his cotton-padded nest in their branches or in the shrubbery below. The song is a simple _we-chee, chee, chee, chee, cher-wee_, resembling that of the Chestnut-side, but has its own distinctive tone which permits of ready identification, once it has been learned. The bluish white eggs, thickly marked with shades of brown, are laid the latter half of May. BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER _Dendroica cÃ¦rulescens cÃ¦rulescens. Case 6, Figs. 58, 59_ The male is unmistakable; the female may be known by the white spot at the base of the outer wing-feathers. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern Connecticut, the mountains of Pennsylvania, and southern Michigan north to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, very common T.V., Apl. 19-May 30; Aug. 4-Oct. 9. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 25-May 28; Aug. 26-Oct. 10. Cambridge, rather common. T.V., May 10-25; Sept. 20-Oct. 10. N. Ohio, common. T.V., Apl. 27-May 29; Sept. 5-Oct. 16. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 29-May 29; Aug. 25-Oct. 10. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V., May 11. A true Wood Warbler, traveling through the trees with the scattered bands of other members of his family as he journeys to and from his summer home. This, in the northern part of his nesting range, is in coniferous forests, in the southern part, deciduous forests. In both, however, the birds require heavy undergrowth in which their bark-covered nest is built within a foot or two of the ground. The grayish white, brown-marked eggs are laid in late May or early June. Miss Paddock in ""Warblers of North America"" describes the Black-throated Blue's song as ""an insect-like buzzing note repeated three or four times with a rising inflection."" Cairn's Warbler (_D. c. cairnsi_) is a nearly related race having, in the male, black centers to the feathers of the back. It nests in the upper parts of the Alleghanies, from Maryland to Georgia, and winters in the West Indies. MYRTLE WARBLER _Dendroica coronata. Case 5, Fig. 27_ The yellow rump is always evident, but in fall and winter the whole plumage is duller, more brownish and the yellow patches at the sides of the breast and in the crown are less conspicuous. A rather large Warbler. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and northern Minnesota to Canada; winters from Kansas and southern New England to the tropics. Washington, abundant W.V., Aug. 7-May 23. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 13-May 28; Aug. 16-Nov. 11; a few winter. Cambridge, abundant T.V., Apl. 12-May 20; Sept. 1-Nov. 1; a few winter. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 12-May 20; Sept. 15-Nov. 3. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 8-May 28; Sept. 25-Dec. 29. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 6-; Sept. 9-Oct. 28. A hardy Warbler which, like the Tree Swallow, can substitute bayberries for insects. When the former are available some individuals remain in the North, enduring our winters without apparent discomfort. Its call-note, _tchep_, is as distinctive as its markings, and this fact connected with its general distribution and abundance, makes it one of the best known members of this little-known family. Thayer in ""Warblers of North America"" describes its common song as ""a loud silvery 'sleigh-bell' trill, a vivid, sprightly utterance."" It nests in coniferous forests, building from four to twenty feet from the ground and laying 3-5 white eggs marked with shades of brown, in late May or early June. MAGNOLIA WARBLER _Dendroica magnolia. Case 8, Fig. 42_ The female is duller than the male, but both have the crown gray, a white stripe behind the eye, a yellow rump and the white tail-patches near the middle of the tail, making the tail, when seen from below, appear white, broadly banded with black. L. 5 _Range'_ Nests from northern Massachusetts and northern Michigan, and in the Alleghanies, from West Virginia to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 22-May 30; Aug. 15-Oct. 6. Ossining, common T.V., May 9-28; Aug. 13-Oct. 11. Cambridge, T.V., rather common, May 12-25; not uncommon, Sept. 10-25. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 28-May 27; Sept. 1-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., May 3-June 5; Aug. 12-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 6-; Aug. 12-Sept. 9. A common migrant distinguished by the beauty of his costume even in this family of gayly clad birds. When traveling, the Magnolia may be found in woods and woody growth of varied character, but when nesting, it shows a fondness for spruce forests, building in small spruces usually within six feet of the ground. The Magnolia's song resembles the Yellow Warbler's in tone. Thayer in ""Warblers of North America"" describes it as ""peculiar and easily remembered; _weeto: weeto-weeeÃ©te-eet_, or _witchi, witchi, witchi tit_, the first four notes deliberate and even and comparatively low in tone, the last three hurried and higher pitched, with decided emphasis on the antepenult _weet_ or _witch_."" The eggs, laid in the first half of June, are white marked with brown. CERULEAN WARBLER _Dendroica rara. Case 8, Figs. 46, 47_ The adult male will be recognized at sight, but the female and young must be looked at sharply. The whitish or yellowish line over the eye, in connection with the white wing-bars make a fair field-mark. L. 4-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Texas and Alabama to Minnesota and western New York; locally from North Carolina to Delaware. Washington, several records in May, one in fall. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn, not common, local S.R., May 8-Aug. 19. SE. Minn., rare S.R. A tree-top Warbler of deciduous forests, nesting from 25 to 60 feet above the ground. Its song bears a marked resemblance to that of the Parula and its call-note is said to be like the _tchep_ of the Myrtle Warbler. The white eggs, heavily blotched with brown, are laid in May. CHESTNUT-SIDED WARBLER _Dendroica pensylvanica. Case 8, Figs. 43, 44_ Adults are distinguished by their chestnut sides, yellow crown and wing-bars, but the young are wholly different, silky white below, yellowish green above. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from northern New Jersey and, in the Alleghanies, South Carolina, north to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, abundant T.V., Apl. 19-May 30; Aug. 10-Oct. 14. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., May 2-Sept. 24. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 5-Sept. 10. N. Ohio, T.V., May 2-25. Glen Ellyn, rare S.R., common T.V., May 1-Sept. 26. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 3-Sept. 15. Scrubby second growths undergrown with bushes, roadside borders of trees and bushes, and the brushy margins of woods are all resorts of the Chestnut-side. Here he attracts our attention by his rather loud, frequently uttered song, which strongly suggests that of the Yellow Warbler. The nest is built within a few feet of the ground and the white, brown-marked eggs are laid the latter part of May. BAY-BREASTED WARBLER _Dendroica castanea. Case 8, Figs. 69, 70_ The adult male is unmistakable; the female has chestnut on sides and crown, a grayish streaked back and white wing-bars; the young bird in the fall cannot, in the field, be certainly distinguished from the young Blackpoll, but has the underparts tinted with buff instead of with yellow. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England into Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, sometimes abundant, usually uncommon T.V., May 2-27; Aug. 29-Nov. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 14-28; Aug. 5-Sept. 26. Cambridge, rather rare T.V., May 15-25; Sept. 12-28. N. Ohio, common T.V., May 4-23; Sept. 7-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common; T.V., May 8-June 5; Aug. 13-Oct. 4. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V., May 13-; Aug. 18-Sept. 15. The Bay-breast is one of the rarer members of its family. Most of us know it only as a migrant passing northward in May and southward in September, when it may be found in woodlands associated with other migrating Warblers. Its song resembles that of the Black and White Warbler. Mrs. Farwell describes it as ""a poor, weak, monotonous saw-filing note."" The nest has been found in hemlocks 15-20 feet from the ground. The white eggs, finely marked with shades of brown, are laid in June. BLACK-POLL WARBLER _Dendroica striata. Case 8, Figs. 71, 72_ In the spring, a black cap, white cheeks and a gray, black streaked back distinguish the male; a gray, black-streaked back, the female. In the fall, young and old are olive-green, streaked with black above; yellowish white below, and thus closely resembles the young Bay-breast. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and northern Michigan into Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, abundant T.V., Apl. 28-June 16; Aug. 31-Oct. 20. Ossining, common T.V., May 7-June 6; Aug. 30-Oct. 16. Cambridge, abundant T.V., May 12-June 5; Sept. 8-Oct. 20. N. Ohio, common T.V., May 6-June 2; Sept. 1-Oct. 16. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., May 2-June 8; Aug. 23-Sept. 27. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 8-; Aug. 27-. Toward the end of the May Warbler 'waves' the Blackpolls come in force. They are excessively fat and, perhaps for this reason, move rather slowly for a Warbler. They are Wood Warblers, but at this season may overflow into the trees of our lawns and orchards. Mrs. Farwell describes the Blackpoll's song as ""a succession of hesitating, staccato, unmusical notes varying greatly in volume. The notes separated, not combined in twos, as in the Black and White Warbler's song."" When nesting this Warbler frequents stunted spruce forests, placing its nest in these trees a few feet above the ground, and laying 4-5 white, brown-marked eggs the latter part of June. BLACKBURNIAN WARBLER _Dendroica fusca. Case 8, Figs. 67, 68_ The orange breast, fiery in the spring male, duller in the female and fall males, is distinctive. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Massachusetts (locally) and central Minnesota north to Canada and southward in the Alleghanies to Georgia; winters in the tropics. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 30-June 3; Aug. 14-Oct. 7. Ossining, common T.V., May 10-29; Aug. 15-Oct. 15. Cambridge, T.V., uncommon, May 12-22; rare, Sept. 15-30. N. Ohio, common T.V., May 4-June 8; Aug. 12-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 3-; Sept. 4. The remoteness of their homes prevents us from making the acquaintance of the brilliantly plumaged birds of the tropics, but among them all we will find none more beautiful than this flame-breasted Warbler, which each spring comes from his tropical winter home almost to our doors. In the summer he seeks the seclusion of coniferous forests and the higher branches of spruce or hemlock. There his nest is made sometimes 80 or more feet above the ground, and in late May or early June the white eggs, spotted, speckled and blotched with brown, are laid. The Blackburnian's song is described by Miss Paddock in ""Warblers of North America"" as ""very shrill and fine, growing even more shrill and wiry as it rises toward the end."" YELLOW-THROATED WARBLER _Dendroica dominica dominica. Case 5, Fig. 18_ A gray Warbler with a yellow throat. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Southeastern States, nesting north to Maryland; wintering from central Florida southward. Washington, rare S.R., rather common late in July and Aug.; Apl. 19-Sept. 4. The loud, ringing _ching-ching-ching, chicker, cherwee_ of the Yellow-throated Warbler is one of the characteristic bird songs of spring in southern woods. The bird usually sings from the upper branches of tall trees, often cypresses, in Florida, but further north, from pines, where he can be far more easily heard than seen. The nest is placed 30-40 feet from the ground and the white eggs, thickly marked with shades of brown, are laid in April. The Sycamore Warbler (_D. d. albilora, Case 5, Fig. 19_) is a nearly related race of the Yellow-throat which inhabits the Mississippi Valley nesting as far north as southern Michigan and wintering in the tropics. It differs from the Atlantic coast form in having a smaller bill and no yellow in front of the eye. As its name implies, it favors sycamore trees. BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLER _Dendroica virens virens. Case 6, Fig. 62_ The female has a yellow throat and a band of black spots on the breast, but both sexes may be known by the yellow cheeks and the large amount of white in the tail. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from Long Island and northern Ohio north to Canada and south in the Alleghanies to Georgia. Washington, very common T.V., Apl. 22-May 30; Aug. 26-Oct. 21. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 30-June 3; Sept. 1-Oct. 26; a few breed. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 1-Oct. 15. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 25-May 24; Sept. 1-Oct. 16; a few breed. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 29-June 6; Aug. 22-Oct. 12. SE. Minn., common T.V., uncommon S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 22. The quiet little _zee-zee, zee-ee-zee_ of the Black-throated Green announces the arrival of the vanguard of true Wood Warblers, which for the succeeding two weeks will pass in countless numbers through our woodlands, still almost leafless. At this time we may find him wherever trees grow, but his real summer home is coniferous forests, especially of hemlocks, in which he often builds his nests 15-20 feet above the ground. The eggs, laid in late May or early June, are white spotted and speckled with brown. A southern form of this Warbler (_D. v. waynei_) has been described from the vicinity of Charleston, S.C. KIRTLAND'S WARBLER _Dendroica kirtlandi. Case 8, Fig. 45_ A large Warbler, pale yellow below; crown slaty; back brownish streaked with black. _Range._ Nests in Oscoda, Crawford and Roscommon Counties, Michigan, winters in the Bahamas; in migration has been found within the area from Minneapolis, Minn., to Toronto, Ont., south to St. Louis, Mo., and Fort Myer, Va., and south-eastward. Washington, one record, Sept. 25, 1887. N. Ohio, rare T.V., May 9 and 11. Glen Ellyn, one record, May 7, 1894. SE. Minn., one record, Minneapolis, May 13. Kirtland's Warbler has one of the smallest nesting areas of any North American bird and consequently is one of our rarest species. In the summer it lives among the jack-pines of north central Michigan, nesting on the ground beneath them. When migrating, it may be found usually near the ground, where it may be identified by its habit of tail-wagging. Its song is described by Wood in ""Warblers of North America"" as belonging to the whistling type with the clear, ringing quality of the Oriole's. The 3-5 eggs, laid early in June, are white speckled with brown in a wreath at the larger end. PINE WARBLER _Dendroica vigorsi vigorsi. Case 4, Fig. 57; Case 6, Fig. 60_ The male is bright greenish yellow below, sometimes duskily streaked; the female is tinged with brown above, below is soiled whitish, tinged with yellow. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf States to Canada; winters from southern Illinois and Virginia southward. Washington, quite uncommon S.R., Mch. 20-Oct. 29, abundant in fall. Ossining, casual. Cambridge, locally common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 20; occasional W.V. N. Ohio, rare T.V., Apl. 29-May 15. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., spring records only, Apl. 17-May 24. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 26-. Pine Warblers seem almost as much a part of pine woods as the trees themselves. They feed on the ground below the pines, they glean from the bark of the trunk, or from the clusters of 'needles' on the topmost boughs, the very peace of the pines is expressed in their calm, even, musical trill; and where there are no pines there are no Pine Warblers. During the migration, it is true, they may be found elsewhere, but at that season they are travelers, and travelers cannot always be responsible for their surroundings. Their nest, of course, is always built in pines, usually from 30-50 feet above the ground. The eggs laid in March in the South, and early June in the North, are white wreathed with brown at the larger end. YELLOW PALM WARBLER _Dendroica palmarum hypochrysea. Case 6, Fig. 61_ Underparts bright yellow streaked with reddish brown; cap reddish brown; line over the eye yellow. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Maine northward; winters from North Carolina to the Florida Keys; west to Louisiana. Washington, T.V., common. Mch. 31-Apl. 29; Sept. 4-Oct. 28. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 11-May 5; Sept. 20-Nov. 8. Cambridge, usually common, sometimes abundant, T.V., Apl. 15-May 5; Oct. 1-15. A tail-wagging Warbler that frequents bushy places, weedy fields and open pine woods and gardens, living near the ground where it may be easily seen. Its call-note, _chip_, is distinctive and one learns in time to recognize it. Its song is a trill, clear and sweet, but by no means loud. The Palm Warbler (_D. p. palmarum_) is the Mississippi Valley form of the Atlantic coast race, from which it differs in having the line over the eye white instead of yellow; the yellow of the underparts paler and confined to the throat and breast. It is not infrequent during the fall migration in the North Atlantic States and, in Florida, is far more common than the Yellow Palm. Washington, rare T.V., Apl. 22-May 18; Sept. 18-Oct. 11. Ossining. T.V., Apl. 29; Sept. 30-Oct. 12. Cambridge, uncommon T.V. in fall, Sept. 15-Oct. 10. N. Ohio, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 24-May 20; Sept. 10-Oct. 16. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 23-May 19; Sept. 4-Oct. 18. SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 23; Sept. 17-Oct. 3. Both races nest on the ground. PRAIRIE WARBLER _Dendroica discolor. Case 8, Fig. 48_ A small Warbler with a reddish brown patch in the back, yellowish wing-bars, and much white in the tail. L. 4-3/4. _Range._ Nests from Florida and northern Mississippi to Michigan and New Hampshire. Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 12-Sept. 20. Ossining, rare S.R., May 2-Sept. 14. Cambridge, locally common S.R., May 8-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, rare, Apl. 29, May 9, and 14. Scrubby second growths, hillsides with scattered cedars and barberries, and, sometimes, bushy places in the pines are the haunts of the miscalled Prairie Warbler. Common and generally distributed in the South, it is local in the North and not always found in districts which seem to supply all its wants. Its song is composed of six or seven minute _zees_, the next to the last one usually the highest. The nest is generally built within 4 feet of the ground, the eggs, laid in May, are white marked with shades of brown, often wreathed about the larger end. OVEN-BIRD _Seiurus aurocapillus. Case 6, Fig. 64_ An olive brownish bird, white streaked with black below, with an orange, black-bordered crown and no white on wings or in tail. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Missouri to Canada; winters from Florida southward. Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 17. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 27-Oct. 10. Cambridge, very common S.R., May 6-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Apl. 22-Oct. 1. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., common T.V., Apl. 28-Sept. 30. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 22. The Oven-bird, and its near relatives the Water-Thrushes, bear so little resemblance in color and habits to the true Wood Warblers, that one might well think they were members of another family. Their plumage lacks the bright colors, white wing-bars and tail-patches possessed by most Warblers, and, instead of hopping and flitting from twig to twig, they spend their time chiefly _walking_ on the ground, where they find their food. It is not so much its abundance as its song which makes the Oven-bird well known. Years ago Mr. Burroughs wrote it, _teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher_, and no one has improved on this description. The Oven-bird also sings an ecstatic warbling on the wing; a thrilling performance. The nest is built on the ground and, like a Dutch oven, is roofed over with the entrance at one side. The eggs, laid in May, are white, marked chiefly at the larger end with brown. NORTHERN WATER-THRUSH _Seiurus noveboracensis noveboracensis. Case. 8, Fig. 56_ Underparts white tinged with pale _yellow_, everywhere--_including throat_--streaked with black; no white in tail or wings. L. 6. _Range._ Nests from northern New England to Canada, south in the mountains, to West Virginia; winters in the tropics. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 22-June 2; July 21-Oct. 6. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 11-21; July 28-Oct. 3. Cambridge, abundant T.V., May 8-June 1; Aug. 10-Oct. 10. N. Ohio, common, T.V., Apl. 26-May 25; Sept. 1-15. The two Water-Thrushes and the Oven-bird are _walking_ Warblers, and the Water-Thrushes, furthermore, are _teeterers_, nervously tipping tail and body with apparently exhaustless energy. When migrating, the Northern Water-Thrush often seeks refuge beneath the shrubbery of our lawns, but when nesting it frequents the borders of streams in deep woods, building its home on the ground or in the roots of an upturned tree. Its call-note is a sharp _chink_; its song a hurried rush of loud musical notes, closing abruptly. The 4-5 eggs, laid in the latter half of May or early June, are white with numerous brown markings chiefly about the larger end. Grinnell's Water-Thrush (_S. n. notabilis_), a slightly larger and darker form, nests in the Northwest and is casually found as a migrant on the Atlantic coast. LOUISIANA WATER-THRUSH _Seiurus motacilla. Case 5, Fig. 5_ Line over eye and underparts white, the latter tinted with _buff_ (not with yellow, as in the preceding species); the throat white _unmarked_; no white in wings or tail. L. 6-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Texas to southern New England and southeastern Minnesota; winters in the tropics. Washington, rare S.R., Apl. 2-Sept. 14. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 9-Aug. 24. N. Ohio, tolerably common S.R., Mch. 28-Sept. 15. SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., Apl. 17-Aug. 26. A shy spirit of woodland brooks, the Louisiana Water-Thrush resembles the Northern Water-Thrush in habits but is more difficult to see; its call-note is louder, its song, wilder, more ringing. Like the Oven-bird it also has a flight, or 'ecstasy'-song. It nests in a bank or among the roots of a fallen tree, laying 4-6 eggs, white with numerous brown markings, in late April or early May. KENTUCKY WARBLER _Oporornis formosus. Case 8, Fig. 52_ A yellow line from the bill around the eye; crown blackish; no white on wings or tail. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Texas to southern Wisconsin and the lower Hudson Valley; winters in the tropics. Washington, not very uncommon S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 2. Ossining, common S.R., May 2-Aug. 27. N. Ohio, rare, Apl. 27 and May 12. Wet woodland with luxuriant undergrowth of bushes, ferns and skunk cabbage are the favorite haunts of this sweet-voiced Warbler, and its nest is usually built among vegetation of this character. Its freely uttered song is a loud, clear two-syllabled whistle, in tone like the voice of the Carolina Wren or Cardinal. Its 4-5 eggs, laid in late May or early June, are white, speckled chiefly about the larger end with shades of brown. CONNECTICUT WARBLER _Oporornis agilis. Case 8, Figs. 77, 78_ A complete white eye-ring; male without black on the gray breast. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests in the interior from north Michigan to Manitoba; winters in the tropics. Washington, T.V., very rare in spring, May 24-30; common from Aug. 28-Oct. 24. Ossining, rare T.V., Aug. 26-Oct. 9. Cambridge, fall T.V., sometimes locally abundant, Sept. 10-30. N. Ohio, tolerably common T.V., May 7-24. Glen Ellyn, fairly common T.V., May 12-June 28; Aug. 14-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V., June 1. In the Atlantic Coast States this Warbler is found only as a fall migrant, at times in considerable numbers. It lives on the ground in or at the border of woods usually where there is dense undergrowth, and would easily escape observation were it not for its sharp call-note, _peek_, by which it may be identified. Its song, heard only on its migrations up the Mississippi Valley and on its nesting ground, has been described as resembling that of both the Oven-bird and Maryland Yellow-throat. The only nest recorded was found by Ernest Seton near Carberry, Manitoba, June 21, 1883. It was on the ground and contained 4 eggs, white with a few spots about the larger end. MOURNING WARBLER _Oporornis philadelphia. Case 8, Figs. 75, 76_ Male without white eye-ring; and with a black breast veiled with gray. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from northern New York and Michigan to Canada, south in the mountains to West Virginia; winters in the tropics. Washington, very rare T.V., May 6-30; Aug. 17-Oct. 1. Ossining, rare T.V., May 28-29; Aug. 18-Oct. 1. Cambridge, rare T.V., May 22-June 5; Sept. 12-25. N. Ohio, tolerably common T.V., May 5-28. Glen Ellyn, rather rare T.V., May 18-June 8; Aug. 17-. SE. Minn., uncommon T.V., May 13-; Aug. 1-Sept. 10. The Mourning Warbler is one of the rarer Warblers which, by good fortune, we may occasionally see toward the end of the spring migration. It is usually found in the lower growth, being a brush and tangle haunter of woods and clearings. Its song, which is described as clear and ringing, is uttered frequently, often from a dead limb. The nest is built in briars or bushes within a foot or two of the ground. The eggs, laid in the first half of June, are white with a few brownish spots at the larger end. MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT _Geothlypis trichas trichas. Case 8, Figs. 50, 51_ The gray-bordered, black mask of the male makes him unmistakable. The female is without distinctive markings, but may easily be identified by her notes and actions. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Virginia and the lower Mississippi Valley northward; winters from North Carolina to Florida. Washington, abundant S.R., Apl. 13-Oct. 21. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 28-Oct. 23. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 5-Oct. 20; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Apl. 25-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., May 2-Oct. 2. SE. Minn., common S.R. A fidgety, inquisitive inhabitant of bushy undergrowth along roadsides and wood borders, whose impatient off-repeated call-note, _chack, chack_, and energetic song of _wichity, wichity, wichity_, soon become familiar to the bird-student. It nests on or near the ground and the white, lightly spotted eggs are laid in the latter half of May. The Florida Yellow-throat (_G. t. ignota_), a more deeply colored race, is found from North Carolina to southern Florida. In the last-named State it usually inhabits scrub palmetto growths. YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT _Icteria virens virens. Case 8, Fig. 49_ A large bird, superficially, quite unlike the true Warblers but nevertheless agreeing with them in essential structure. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Texas and northern Florida to southern Minnesota and (locally) Massachusetts; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 16-Sept. 28. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 28-Aug. 29. Cambridge, rather rare and irregular S.R., May 15-Sept. N. Ohio, common S.R., May 1-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, local, not common. May 10-Aug. 16. SE. Minn., rare S.R. (?). If the Chat lived in England what a wealth of lore, legend, and literature would owe its origin to his strange ways and stranger notes! Here he is known to few but the initiated, who find an endless interest in his odd song-medley and peculiar antics. Go yourself to the brush-grown, thickety wood borders and clearings he loves and let him be his own interpreter. You may even find his nest low down in some crotch with its white, evenly speckled eggs, and hear his angry _ch[)u]t_ as he resents your presence. HOODED WARBLER _Wilsonia citrina. Case 8, Figs. 54, 55_ The yellow face and black 'hood' distinguishes the male, but both sexes may be known by the large amount of white in the outer tail-feathers. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Louisiana north to Michigan and Connecticut; winters in the tropics. Washington, locally common, S.R., Apl. 19-Oct. 1. Ossining, rare S.R., to Sept. 1. N. Ohio, rare. May 8, 9, 12 and 22. Color, song, habit and temperament combine to make the Hooded Warbler one of the most attractive members of its family. As one sees it flitting from bush to bush in woodland undergrowth, displaying its white outer tail-feathers as it flies, pausing now and again to utter its simple, sweet whistled song, one is impressed not only by its beauty but by its gentleness. It nests in a bush within a foot or two of the ground, laying 3-5 white eggs, wreathed with shades of brown spots, early in May, in the South, in June, in the North. WILSON'S WARBLER _Wilsonia pusilla pusilla. Case 8, Figs. 73, 74_ The female usually lacks the black cap, when she resembles the female Hooded, but is smaller and has no white in the tail. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and northern Minnesota northward; winters in the tropics. Washington, rather common T.V., May 1-26; Aug. 27-Oct. 6. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 9-30; Aug. 10-Sept. 9. Cambridge, common T.V., May 12-25; uncommon, Sept. 5-20. N. Ohio, tolerably common T.V., May 5-June 2; Sept. 5-15. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 7-June 26; Aug. 16-Sept. 21. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 2-; Aug. 23-Sept. 27. Wilson's Warbler, a flycatching Warbler of the lower growth, favors bushes near water, but is also found in dryer places. Thayer in ""Warblers of North America"" says that its ""song has much of the ringing clarity of the Canada's and Hooded's songs."" It nests on the ground, laying 4 eggs, usually with a wreath of spots at the larger end, early in June. CANADIAN WARBLER _Wilsonia canadensis. Case 8, Fig. 53_ Above gray, no white in wings or tail; breast with a necklace of black spots, paler and less numerous in the female. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Massachusetts and central Minnesota northward, south in the mountains to Tennessee; winters in the tropics. Washington, very common T.V., May 5-June 2; July 31-Sept. 25. Ossining, common T.V., May 6-June 2; Aug. 10-Oct. 11. Cambridge, common, May 12-30, rare, Sept. 1-15; rare S.R. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 28-May 27; Sept. 1-18. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., May 5-June 6; Aug. 15-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 8-; Aug. 18-Sept. 5. The Canadian Warbler haunts the lower growth of deciduous forests. It is ""a sprightly, wide-awake, fly-snapping Warbler, vivid in movement and in song"" (Thayer). ""The song is liquid, uncertain, varied, bright and sweet"" (Farwell). It nests on the ground early in June, laying 4-5 eggs much like those of Wilson's Warbler. REDSTART _Setophaga ruticilla. Case 8, Figs. 57, 58_ The female is yellow where the male is flame-color; young males resemble the female, but usually have more or less black on the breast. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Arkansas and North Carolina to Canada; winters in the tropics. Washington, very abundant T.V., Apl, 15-May; Aug. 19-Sept. 30; a few breed. Ossining, common S.R., May 1-Oct. 3. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 5-Sept. 20. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn. not common S.R., common T.V., May 3-Oct. 5. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 2-Sept. 22. His bright colors, graceful, aerial pirouetting, abundance, and frequently uttered song make the Redstart the most conspicuous as well as one of the most attractive of our woodland Warblers. So exquisite a creature should be as widely known as are violets or daisies. The Redstart builds its well-made nest in a crotch, usually about fifteen feet above the ground. The 4-5 grayish white eggs, spotted and blotched chiefly at the larger end, are laid in mid-May. WAGTAILS AND PIPITS. FAMILY MOTACILLIDÃ AMERICAN PIPIT _Anthus rubescens. Case 4, Fig. 62; Case 5, Fig. 17_ Outer tail-feathers white, bill slender, back grayish. L. 6-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Newfoundland to Greenland; winters from Maryland to Florida and Mexico. Washington, W.V., sometimes abundant, Oct. 2-May 12. Ossining, common T.V., Mch. 26-(?); Sept. 24-Nov. 16. Cambridge, T.V., abundant Sept. 20-Nov. 10; rare Apl. 10-May 20. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 6-May 20; Oct. 19. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., Apl. 15-; Sept. 30-Oct. 18. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 4-; Oct. At first glance a Pipit might be mistaken for a Sparrow--let us say, a Vesper Sparrow; but note that it walks, instead of hops, that it constantly wags or 'tips' its tail, that it has a slender, not stout bill. Meadows, pastures, plowed fields, golf-courses, are frequented by Pipits, usually in flocks of a dozen or more. When flushed, with a faint _dee-dee_, they bound lightly into the air but usually soon return to earth. Sprague's Pipit (_Anthus spraguei_), a slightly smaller species, nests in Montana, Dakota, and northward, and is sometimes found in small numbers on the coast of South Carolina and Georgia in winter. THRASHERS, MOCKINGBIRDS, ETC. FAMILY MIMIDÃ MOCKINGBIRD _Mimus polyglottos polyglottos. Case 4; Fig. 76_ To be confused in color only with the Loggerhead Shrike, but larger, with a longer tail, no black on the face and totally different habits. L. 10-1/2. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf to Iowa and Maryland; rarely to Massachusetts; winters from Maryland southward. Washington, uncommon P.R., less numerous in winter. Cambridge, rare S.R., Mch. to Nov. No southern garden is complete without a Mockingbird to guard its treasures with his harsh alarm-note and extol its beauties in his brilliant, varied song. He is to the South what the Robin is to the North--and more, for he is present throughout the year while the Robin is with us only during the nesting season. The Mocker builds in bushes, orange-trees or other dense vegetation, from late March, in southern Florida, to early May in Virginia. The 4-6 eggs are blue heavily marked with brown. CATBIRD _Dumatella carolinensis. Case 4, Fig. 81; Case 6, Fig. 71_ Both sexes of the Catbird wear the same costume at all seasons and all ages. L. 9. _Range._ Nests from Florida and Texas to Canada winters from South Carolina to the tropics. Washington, abundant S.R., Apl. 34-Oct. 11; occasionally winters. Ossining, common S.R. Apl. 28-Oct. 25. Cambridge, abundant S.R., May 6-Oct. 1; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 21-Oct. 5. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 30-Oct. 6. If the Catbird's name were based on his song instead of on his call-note, he might have won the popularity he deserves, but which seems forever denied him. Taking kindly to civilization he makes his home near ours, asking only the shelter of our shrubbery and a share of our small fruits in return for three months of music such as but few birds can produce. The Catbird nests in bushes and thickets laying 3-5 greenish blue eggs in May. BROWN THRASHER _Toxostoma rufum. Case 4, Fig. 82; Case 6, Fig. 72_ Tail and bill much longer than in the Thrushes; white wing-bars; eye pale yellow. L. 11-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Florida and Louisiana to Canada; winters from North Carolina and SE. Missouri to Florida and Texas. Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 8-Oct.; occasionally winters. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 22-Oct. 28. Cambridge common S.R., Apl. 36-Oct. 20. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 6-Oct. 15. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Apl. 9-Oct. 11. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 15-Oct. 7. In the wealth of new experiences and awakened associations which crowd the bird-lover's days in April and May, none stands out more clearly in my memory than the first Thrasher's song. The rich, distinctly enunciated notes ring loud and clear above all other songs as the bird from some tree-top gives his musical message to the world. The performance concluded he returns to the undergrowth whence one may hear his explosive, whistled _wheÃ¨u_ or sharp kissing note. The nest is built in bushy growths or on the ground in May. The 3-6 eggs are grayish white finely speckled with reddish brown. WRENS. FAMILY TROGLODYTIDÃ CAROLINA WREN _Thryothorus ludovicianus ludovicianus. Case 4. Fig. 64_ Largest and most brightly colored of our Wrens. Note the buff or whitish line over the eye. L. 5-1/2. _Range._ Gulf States north to Connecticut and Iowa; non-migratory. The Florida Wren (_T. l. miamensis_) a slightly larger, more richly colored form, inhabits Florida from Palatka southward. Washington, common P.R. Cambridge, rare or casual. N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. The Carolina Wren is a bird of the woods, whose loud, musical whistles are among the most conspicuous of southern bird notes. They suggest those of both the Cardinal and Tufted Titmouse, but are more varied in character. A common scolding call is recognizably wren-like, while another suggests a tree-toad's _krrring_. The nest is built in holes, in April. The 4-6 eggs are white with numerous reddish brown and lavender markings. BEWICK'S WREN _Thryomanes bewicki bewicki_ Size of the House Wren, but with the tail nearly half an inch longer; its outer feathers tipped with gray. _Range._ Mississippi Valley from the Gulf States to southern Michigan; rare east of the Alleghanies. Washington, rare and local T.V., Mch. 26-July-; may winter, Nov. 24-Dec. 22. A house Wren of the States west of the Alleghanies with a tail that seems to be at the mercy of passing breezes, and a song resembling the Song Sparrow's, but louder. Its nesting habits resemble those of the House Wren. The 4-6 eggs, laid in April, are white speckled with reddish brown and lavender. HOUSE WREN _Troglodytes aÃ«don aÃ«don. Case 4, Fig. 63; Case 6, Fig. 70_ No introduction is needed to this feathered tenant of many bird-lovers. L. 5. _Range._ Nests from Virginia and Kentucky to Canada; winters from South Carolina and lower Mississippi Valley to Mexico. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 13-Oct. 11. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 23-Oct. 14. Cambridge, formerly abundant S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 25; now rare and local. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 5. Glen Ellyn, S.R. in isolated pairs; Apl. 26-Oct. 13. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 18. The familiar inhabitant of our bird-houses whose numbers seem limited only by the nesting-sites we offer him. His little fountain of melody bubbles forth irrepressibly to cheer his mate or challenge a rival. With the exhaustless energy of their kind they fill their nest-box with twigs, grasses and feathers, wherein are laid 6-8 minutely and evenly speckled pinkish eggs. WINTER WREN _Nannus hiemalis hiemalis. Case 2, Fig. 58_ Smaller than the House Wren; underparts brownish, flanks and belly finely barred. L. 4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and Central Michigan north to Canada and, in the Alleghanies, south to North Carolina; winters from the Northern States to the Gulf. Washington, rather common W.V., Aug. 10-May 1. Ossining, tolerably common W.V., Sept. 18-Apl. 27. Cambridge, T.V. uncommon, Sept. 20-Nov. 25; rare, Apl. 10-25; a very few winter. N. Ohio, tolerably common. W.V., Sept. 14-May 17. Glen Ellyn, fairly common T.V., Apl. 1-May 10; Sept. 9-Nov. 7. SE. Minn., common T.V., rare W.V., Sept. 22-Apl. 3. The Winter Wren comes to us from the North when the House Wren leaves for the South and remains with us until the House Wren returns in the spring. But one by no means takes the place of the other. The Winter Wren is a wood Wren that lives in fallen tree-tops, old brush-piles or similar retreats, and his nervous _chimp, chimp_, as with cocked-up tail he hops into view for a second, is like the call of the Song Sparrow rather than the scolding note of most Wrens; nor does his rippling, trickling song resemble the House Wren's sudden outburst. The nest is built in the roots of a tree or similar location. The 5-7 eggs, laid in early June, are white, finely, but rather sparingly speckled with brownish. SHORT-BILLED MARSH WREN _Cistothorus stellaris. Case 8, Fig. 80_ Smallest of our Wrens; the head and back streaked with white. L. 4. _Range._ Nests from central Missouri and northern Delaware to Saskatchewan and southern Maine; winters from southern Illinois and southern New Jersey to the Gulf. Washington, very rare T.V., two instances, May. Ossining, rare S.R., to Oct. 16. Cambridge, formerly locally common S.R., May 12-Sept. 25; now chiefly T.V. N. Ohio, rare, May 12, 14, 16 and 19. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., May 8-Oct. 17. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 13-Sept. 19. Although we have only six species of Wrens in the eastern United States, they are so unlike in their choice of haunts that few localities which will afford them the hiding places they all love are without one or more of them. The House and Bewick's Wrens make their homes near ours; the Carolina and Winter Wrens prefer the woods; the Long-billed Marsh Wren's haunts have given him his name, and if we should call the present species Meadow Wren, its home would be similarly indicated, for it lives in wet, grassy places rather than among the cat-tails. Ernest Seton describes its note as resembling the sound produced by striking two pebbles together, while its song is a series of _chaps_, running into _chap-r-r-rrr_. The globular nest is built on the ground, and the 6-8 eggs, laid in May, are usually pure white. LONG-BILLED MARSH WREN _Telmatodytes palustris palustris. Case 8, Fig. 79_ Darker and larger than the Short-billed Marsh Wren, with a blackish brown crown and white stripe over the eye. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Virginia to Canada; winters from southern New Jersey to South Carolina. Worthington's Marsh Wren (_T. p. griseus_) is the form of the Atlantic coast from South Carolina to Florida. Marian's Marsh Wren (_T. p. marianÃ¦_) is found on the more southern Atlantic coast and on the Gulf coast of Florida; while the Prairie Marsh Wren (_T. p. iliacus_) nests in the Mississippi Valley east to Indiana north to Canada, and winters along the Gulf coast. Where two races may be expected to occur together (for example, in the South, during the winter) field identification of the various races may be left to experts and the average observer must be content with plain ""Marsh Wren."" Washington, very numerous S.R., Apl. 15-Nov. 1. Ossining, common S.R., May 10-Oct. 28. Cambridge, locally abundant S.R., May 15-Oct. 1; sometimes a few winter. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 21-Sept. 20. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., May 16-Oct. 10. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 5-Sept. 9. As well look for pond lilies on a rocky hillside as a Marsh Wren outside a marsh. Give him cat-tails for cover and to support his bulky nest and he is at home. His scolding notes betray his ancestry and his reeling, rippling song, delivered both from a perch and on fluttering wings above the reeds, suggests in form, at least, that of the House Wren. The 5-9 eggs, laid in early June are uniform chocolate or thickly marked with brown. CREEPERS. FAMILY CERTHIIDÃ BROWN CREEPER _Certhia familiaris americana. Case 2, Fig. 59_ Tail-feathers with stiffened points, bill slender and slightly carved. L. 5-3/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and south along the Alleghanies to North Carolina; winters south to Florida. Washington, common W.V., Sept. 22-May 1. Ossining, tolerably common W.V., Sept. 20-May 7. Cambridge, common T.V., rather common W.V.. Sept. 25-May 1; one summer record N. Ohio, common W.V., Oct. 1-May 9. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common W.V., Sept. 15-May 19. SE. Minn., common T.V., uncommon W.V., Sept. 25-Mch. 30. To see the Brown Creeper is to knew him but so inconspicuous is he that unless you chance to observe him drop from one to tree near the foot of another, you may overlook the little figure creeping spirally upward. Nor are his thin, weak, squeaky call-notes more likely to attract attention than he is himself. A true bird of the bark, he not only hunts upon it but builds his nest behind it, laying 5-8 white, brown-spotted eggs in May. NUTHATCHES. FAMILY SITTIDÃ WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH _Sitta carolinensis carolinensis. Case 2, Figs. 38, 39; Case 4, Fig. 65_ Crown black, cheeks white; breast white; the female with a gray crown. L. 6. _Range._ Nests from Gulf States to Canada; a Permanent Resident. The Florida White-breasted Nuthatch (_S. c. atkinsi_) a slightly smaller form in which the female as well as the male has the crown black, is the race inhabiting Florida, the Atlantic coast to South Carolina and the Gulf coast to Mississippi. Washington, common T.V. and W.V., less common S.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, P.R., rare in summer, uncommon in winter, common in migrations; most numerous in Oct. and Nov. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, fairly common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. During the summer we will see comparatively little of this bird who, with equal ease, climbs either down or up a tree trunk, but in the winter he will be a constant patron of the nuts and suet on our lunch counters. Habit, markings, his unmistakable _yank-yank_, all distinguish him from our other birds, except his Canadian cousin to which, after all, he bears only a family resemblance. In April, 5-7 white, brown speckled eggs are laid in a hole in a tree, lined with feathers, etc. RED-BREASTED NUTHATCH _Sitta canadensis. Case 2, Figs. 60, 61_ Underparts brownish, a line through the eye, black in the male, slate in the female. Smaller than the White-breasted Nuthatch. L. 4-3/4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England and northern Minnesota into Canada; south along the Alleghanies to North Carolina; winters from southern Canada to the Gulf States. Washington, irregularly abundant W.V., sometimes rare, Sept. 15-May 10. Ossining, irregular W.V., Aug. 8-May 8. Cambridge, irregular T.V., and W.V., Aug. 15-Nov. 25; Nov. 25-Apl. 15. N. Ohio, tolerably common W.V., Sept. 4-May 22. Glen Ellyn, irregular T.V., Apl. 24-May 21; Aug. 19-Dec. 12. SE. Minn., common T.V., uncommon W.V., Sept. 24-Apl. 21. Late in August when I hear a note such as one might imagine a baby Nuthatch would utter, I know that the Red-breasted Nuthatch has arrived from the north perhaps to spend the winter, or, may be, to go farther south. He never seems quite as familiar as his larger, louder-voiced, white-breasted cousin, and if one wants to make his acquaintance it is well to follow the sound of his penny-trumpet-like notes until their author is discovered. BROWN-HEADED NUTHATCH _Sitta pusilla. Case 4, Fig. 66_ The head is browner than in the figure; the nape has a downy white patch. Smallest of our Nuthatches. L. 4-1/2. _Range._ Nests from Florida to southern Delaware and southern Missouri; a Permanent Resident. The Brown-headed Nuthatch is a bird of southern pine forests; one may travel for miles without seeing a single individual and then discover a company of a score or more. They pass most of their time among the upper branches uttering a _pit-pit_ as they hunt for food, or all suddenly joining in a metallic _tnee-tnee-tnee_, when they are apt to take flight to the adjoining trees. The nest is in a hole in a tree or stump, generally near the ground; 5-6 white, heavily marked eggs being laid in March. TITMICE. FAMILY PARIDÃ TUFTED TITMOUSE _BÃ¦olophus bicolor. Case 4, Fig. 67_ A large, gray Titmouse, with a conspicuous crest, black forehead, and reddish brown flanks. L. 6. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf States north to New Jersey and Nebraska. Resident, except at the northern limit of its range. Washington, very common P.R., more so in winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, only two records, Apl. 4 and Nov. 19. The loud _peto, peto, peto_ of the Tufted Tit can be confused only with certain notes of the Carolina Wren, but while skilfull stalking is required to see the Wren, one may walk up and inspect the Tit with little or no caution. When he sees us he may change his call to a hoarse _dee-dee-dee_ which at once betrays his relationship to the Chickadee. The nest is made in a hole, and the 5-8 white, brown-marked eggs are laid in April. BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE _Penthestes atricapillus atricapillus. Case 2, Fig. 37_ Crown black, wing-coverts margined with whitish. L. 5-1/4. _Range._ Nests from central Missouri and northern New Jersey north into Canada, south, along the Alleghanies to North Carolina; winters south to Maryland. Washington, rare and irregular W.V., Oct. 19-Apl. 19. Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R., more numerous in fall and winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, fairly common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R. While the Chickadee is with us throughout the year, it is during the winter that he takes first place in our affections. Active, cheerful, friendly, he is an ever welcome visitor to our lunch-counters, and often shows complete and winning confidence in us by perching on our hands. His clearly enunciated _chick-a-dee_, with its variations, we accept as his characteristic language, but the sentiment expressed in his two- or three-noted whistle seems to belong to the Pewee rather than the sprightly Black-cap. It is, in fact, often falsely attributed to that bird, even when our books tell us that the Pewee is wintering in the tropics! The Chickadee nests in holes, usually within ten feet of the ground, laying 5-9 white, brown-speckled eggs in the first half of May. CAROLINA CHICKADEE _Penthestes carolinensis carolinensis. Case 4, Fig. 68_ Smaller than the Black-cap; without white margins on the wing-coverts. L. 4-1/2. _Range._ Southeastern United States, north to northern New Jersey and central Missouri. The south Florida form (_P. c. impiger_) is slightly smaller and darker. Washington, very common P.R., particularly in winter. Whether because of a different temperament or because milder winters make him less dependent on man's bounty, the Carolina Chickadee does not show that unquestioning confidence in our good faith which makes the Black-cap so dear to us. The _chick-a-dee_ note is less clearly and more hurriedly given by the Carolina, and the _pe-wee_ whistle is not so loud and usually consists of four notes instead of two. The nesting habits and eggs of the two species are alike, but the southern bird begins to lay in March. BROWN-CAPPED CHICKADEE _Penthestes hudsonicus_ Similar to the Black-cap but crown dark brown; back brownish ashy. _Range._ Northern New England and Canada; rarely further south in winter. Represented by three races: the Acadian Brown-capped Chickadee (_P. h. littoralis_) of northern New England, New Brunswick. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland; the Labrador Brown-capped Chickadee (_P. h. nigricans_) of Labrador, and the Hudsonian Brown-capped Chickadee (_P. h. hudsonicus_) of the region west of Hudson Bay. Until recent years the Brown-capped Chickadee was rarely seen far south of its breeding range, but during several winters it has invaded New England in considerable numbers and has been found in the lower Hudson Valley, Long Island, Staten Island and northern New Jersey. At close range an experienced observer may know it by its dark brown head, while Brewster states that its ""nasal, drawling, _tchick, chee-day-day_"" at once distinguishes it from the Black-cap. All three races have been reported in these winter migrations and only expert examination of specimens can determine whether the little wanderer is from Labrador, New Brunswick, or the country west of Hudson Bay. OLD-WORLD WARBLERS, KINGLETS AND GNATCATCHERS. FAMILY SYLVIIDÃ GOLDEN-CROWNED KINGLET _Regulus satrapa satrapa. Case 2, Figs. 62, 63; Case 4, Figs. 72, 73_ Very small, olive-green birds with a flame and yellow crown-patch in the male and a yellow crown-patch in the female. L. 4. _Range._ Nests from northern New England northward and, in the Alleghanies, south to North Carolina. Washington, abundant W.V., Sept. 30-Apl. 27. Ossining, common W.V., Sept. 20-Apl. 28. Cambridge, very common T.V., not uncommon W.V., Sept. 25-Apl. 20. N. Ohio, common W.V., Sept. 26-May 4. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., irregular W.V., Sept. 19-May 8. SE. Minn., common T.V., Mch. 30-; Sept. 21-Dec. 1. It is surprising, in the depth of winter, when in great coat and muffler we keep warm only by vigorous exercise, to see these dainty, feathered mites, unconcerned by the temperature, flitting here and there in their search for insects' eggs and larvÃ¦. They have small fear of man and we may readily approach near enough to hear their thin _ti-ti_ or see their golden-crown. In proportion to its size, this diminutive species lays a larger number of eggs than any other of our birds, as many as 9 or 10 white, brown-marked eggs being laid in their pensile, mossy nest in the latter part of May. RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET _Regulus calendula calendula. Case 4. Figs. 70, 71; Case 5. Figs. 36, 37_ A white eye-ring; two whitish wing-bars, no white in the tail; adult male with a ruby crown-patch; absent in females and young. L. 4-1/2. _Range._ Nests chiefly north of the United States; winters from Virginia and Iowa southward. Washington, abundant T.V., Apl. 12-May 15; Sept. 25-Nov. 1; occasionally winters. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 8-May 13; Sept. 16-Nov. 3. Cambridge, rather common T.V., Apl. 12-May 5; Oct. 10-30. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl, 1-May 23; Sept. 9-Nov. 3. Glen Ellyn, fairly common T.V., Mch. 22-May 19; Sept. 9-Oct. 27. SE. Minn., Mch. 12-; Sept. 18-Oct. 24. A tiny, olive-green bird, with a large white eye-ring, fluttering actively among the yellowing leaves, uttering from time to time a wren-like _cack_ as he twitches his wings and showing little or no fear of man can be only the Ruby-crown, southward bound. He returns before the trees are clad, as the author of a song as marvelous in volume as it is musical in tone; a whistled song of rare sweetness. BLUE-GRAY GNATCATCHER _Polioptila cÃ¦rulea cÃ¦rulea. Case 4. Fig. 69_ A slender, gray mite with a comparatively long tail of which the central feathers are black, the outer ones white. L. 4-1/2. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf States to southern Wisconsin and southern New Jersey; winters from the Gulf States southward. Washington, rather common S.R., Mch. 30-Nov. 23. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., Apl. 22-Aug. 20; possibly later. SE. Minn., rare S.R. In color, form, proportions and voice, the Gnatcatcher may properly be called 'dainty.' His slightly explosive call-note _tin-ng_, is louder than his exquisitely finished, varied, miniature song. The nest is almost as fine in workmanship as a Hummer's. The 4-5 white, thickly speckled eggs, are laid in April and early May. THRUSHES, BLUEBIRDS, ETC. FAMILY TURDIDÃ WOOD THRUSH _Hylocichla mustelina. Case 6, Fig. 74_ Head brighter than tail; underparts _white_, heavily spotted with large, round black dots. Largest of our Thrushes. L. 8-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Florida and Texas north to central Minnesota and southern New Hampshire; winters in the tropics. Washington, common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 10. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 30-Oct. 2. Cambridge, locally common S.R., May 10-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Oct. 1. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 29 SE. Minn., common S.R., May 1-Sept. 19. Most familiar of our Thrushes. From late April to early August his bell-like notes are heard, not only in the forest, but in wood-bordered village streets and from the shade trees of our lawns. His sharp, pebbly, _pit-pit_, is prominent in the chorus of protesting notes which greet the Screech Owl should he leave his retreat before diurnal birds have gone to bed. The nest is usually built in small trees about 8 feet from the ground. The 3-5 greenish blue eggs are laid in May. There is a second brood in June. VEERY _Hylocichla fuscescens fuscescens. Case 6, Fig. 73_ Upperparts, including tail, uniform cinnamon-brown, breast buff with indistinct brownish spots; sides white. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ Nests from northern New Jersey and northern Illinois into Canada and south in the Alleghanies to Georgia; winters in the tropics. A closely related western form, the Willow Thrush (_H. f. salicicola_) nests in Minnesota and westward, and migrates through the Mississippi Valley. To the field naturalist it is essentially the Veery. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 26-June 2. Aug. 18-Sept. 25. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 5. Cambridge, locally abundant S.R., May 8-Sept. 5. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Oct. 1. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 24-May 29; Aug. 26-Sept. 3; SE. Minn., common S.R. May 5. Low, wet woods with considerable undergrowth, where skunk cabbage and hellebore flourish are the home of the Veery. Here he winds his mysterious double-toned spiral song, and here, on the ground, hidden beneath the rank vegetation, he builds his nest. The eggs, laid late in May, resemble those of the Wood Thrush. The Veery's common call is a clearly whistled _wheÃ©-you_, quite unlike the _quirt_ or _pit-pit_ of the Wood Thrush. Except in mountainous regions and some local 'stations,' the Wood Thrush and Veery are the only Thrushes which nest in the eastern United States south of Massachusetts. GRAY-CHEEKED THRUSH _Hylocichla aliciÃ¦ aliciÃ¦. Case 8, Fig. 82_ Upperparts uniform olive; eye-ring whitish, not buffy as in the Olive-backed Thrush (Case 8, Fig. 81); sides of throat and breast less buffy than in the Olive-back. L. 7-1/2. _Range._ Nests north of the United States. Bicknell's Thrush (_H. a. bicknelli_) a slightly smaller, southern form, nests in the higher parts of the Catskills, the mountains of northern New York and northern New England, and northward and eastward into Canada; both visit us in migration and both winter in the tropics. Washington, rather common T.V., May 8-31; Sept. 15-Oct. 20. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 15-June 1; Sept. 20-Oct. 17. Cambridge, uncommon T.V., May 18-28; Sept. 15-Oct. 9. N. Ohio, not common T.V., Apl. 29-May 23. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., May 7-June 4; Aug. 26-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 7-; Sept. 8. The Gray-cheeked and Bicknell's Thrushes are merely the larger northern and smaller southern forms, respectively, of the same species. They are known in the United States chiefly as migrants and can be distinguished with certainty in life only by an expert under favorable conditions. The larger form is the commoner. The species may be known from the Veery and Wood Thrush by its olive, instead of cinnamon-brown back, and from the Olive-backed Thrush by its whitish eye-ring and paler breast. Brewster describes the song of the southern form (Bicknell's Thrush) as exceedingly like that of the Veery but more interrupted, while the ordinary call-note is practically identical with the _pheu_ of the Veery. The nest is placed in low trees or bushes. The eggs are greenish blue spotted with brown. OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH _Hylocichla ustulata swainsoni. Case 8, Fig. 81_ Upperparts uniform olive; eye-ring buff; breast and sides of the throat deeper than in the Gray-cheeked Thrush. L. 7-1/4. _Range._ Nests from northern Michigan and northern New England northward into Canada and southward in the mountains to West Virginia; winters in the tropics. Washington, common T.V., Apl. 19-June 2; Sept. 2-Nov. 1. Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 2-30; Sept. 19-Oct. 22. Cambridge, common T.V., May 13-28; Sept. 15-Oct. 5. N. Ohio, common T.V., Apl. 22-June 13; Sept. 2-Oct. 24. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Apl. 23-June 6; Aug. 16-Oct. 24. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 1-; Sept. 25-. We know this Thrush chiefly as a migrant when, in the latter part of May, and again in September and October, it passes us _en route_ to and from its northern home. At these seasons we may even hear its whistled _puit_ from the sky as it journeys through the night. ""Its song,"" Dwight says, ""lacks the leisurely sweetness of the Hermit Thrush's outpourings, nor is there pause, but in lower key and with greater energy it bubbles on rapidly to a close rather than fading out with the soft melody of its renowned rival."" The Olive-back nests in bushes or low trees, and lays 3-4 greenish blue brown-spotted eggs in June. HERMIT THRUSH _Hylocichla guttata pallasi. Case 4, Fig. 77; Case 5, Fig. 26_ Back midway in color between Figs. 77 and 26; the tail noticeably brighter, more rusty. L. 7-1/4. _Range._ Nests from Long Island (locally), the higher parts of Connecticut, and central Minnesota northward to Canada, and southward in the mountains to Maryland; winters from New Jersey and Ohio Valley to the Gulf States and Cuba. Washington, very common T.V., sometimes not uncommon W.V., Apl. 6-May 17; Sept. 18-Nov. 12. Ossining, common T.V.. Apl. 5-May 9; Oct. 18-Nov. 26. Cambridge, very common T.V., Apl. 15-May 5; Oct. 5-Nov. 15; occasionally one or two may winter; one summer record. N. Ohio, common T.V., Mch. 21-May 10; Oct. 2-28. Glen Ellyn, common T.V., Mch. 18-May 11; Sept. 14-Nov. 1. SE. Minn., common T.V. Apl. 1-; Sept. 13-Oct. 26. The Hermit is the only one of the Thrushes to winter in the eastern United States and it is, therefore, the first one to reach us in the spring. It comes early in April and takes about a month to complete its migration. It rarely sings at this season and then only an echo of the heavenly music which has won for it first place among American songsters. We may know the Hermit Thrush by the season in which he visits us, by his reddish brown tail, which he slowly raises and lowers after alighting, and by the low _chuck_ note with which he usually accomplishes this movement. The Hermit nests on the ground, laying, in the latter part of May, 3-4 greenish-blue eggs, slightly lighter in tint than those of the Wood Thrush. ROBIN _Planesticus migratorius migratorius. Case 4, Fig. 80; Case 5, Fig. 12_ In spring and summer the head is blacker, the breast brighter, the bill more yellow than in fall and winter. L. 10. _Range._ Nests from Virginia (in the mountains, northern Georgia) and northern Mississippi to Labrador and Alaska; winters from New Jersey and Ohio Valley to the Gulf. Birds from the lowlands, from Maryland southward, are somewhat smaller and paler and are known as the Southern Robin (_P. m. achrusterus_). Washington, rather common S.R., abundant T.V., from Feb-Apl.; irregularly common W.V. Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 4-Oct. 30; a few winter. Cambridge, very abundant S.R., common but irregular W.V. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Feb. 26-Nov. 30; a few winter. Glen Ellyn, very common S.R., rare W.V., Jan. 25-Nov. 19. SE. Minn., common S.R., rare W.V., Mch. 8-Nov. 11. The Robin is the best-known and probably most abundant of our native birds. Civilization agrees with him. Man has destroyed many of his enemies and has provided him with a bountiful supply of fruits and a vast area of lawns where worms are at his mercy. Sociable and trustful he has taken up his abode with us and become as much a part of our outdoor life as the flowers in our gardens and trees in our lawns. His varied calls have an intimate association with the hour and season and spring itself speaks through his cheerful song. Robins show their confidence in us by building their nests in situations where few birds would venture to rear a family, and from mid-April to July they are occupied with household cares. BLUEBIRD _Sialis sialis sialis. Case 4, Fig. 78; Case 5, Fig. 13_ The Bluebird's red, white and blue mark him as a truly American bird. L. 7. _Range._ Nests from the Gulf States to Florida; winters from Connecticut and northern Ohio southward. Washington, common S.R., and W.V. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, common S.R., Mch. 6-Nov. 1; more numerous during migrations, in Mch. and Nov. N. Ohio, common S.R., Feb. 17-Nov. 18; a few winter. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., Feb. 19-Nov. 18. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 16-Oct. 31. Not many years ago the Bluebird was as familiar as he was welcome about our homes; but too gentle to battle effectively with English Sparrows and Starlings for the possession of bird houses, he has sought such nesting sites in the orchard as the 'tree surgeons' have left. If we would not lose this bird, ""beloved of children, bards and spring,"" who wears our national colors so modestly, we must supply him with a home in which he may rear his family in peace. It may be placed not only in our garden, but also in the orchard where it is less likely to be occupied by Sparrows or Starlings. It should be erected not later than March 15, for the Bluebird's bluish white eggs are laid in the first half of April.

R. Harding] INTRODUCTORY. If all the methods as given in this book had been studied out by one man and he began trapping when Columbus discovered America, more than four hundred years ago, he would not be half completed. The methods given on the following pages are principally taken from articles published in the H-T-T, and as the writers give their own most successful methods, the trapper of little experience with fox will find them of great value. Their articles are from all parts of America, so that trappers from any section will find a method or methods that can be used. The red fox is the one most sets describe, yet what is a good method for one species is apt to be for others. A. R. HARDING. FOX TRAPPING CHAPTER I. GENERAL INFORMATION. Foxes are found in all parts of America, but probably most numerous in the New England States and parts of Canada. The range of the red is from Virginia to Alaska; grey, Southern and Southwestern States; cross, Northern New Jersey to Manitoba; black, Alaska, and the territories several hundred miles to the South and East; swift, the prairies or Great Plains; white and blue, the Arctic Regions. While their fur has been one of value for many, many years, and they have been hunted, trapped and snared, yet their numbers are holding up remarkably well owing to their shrewdness. While many tricks are claimed for foxes that they never did, yet they are very cunning animals and also fleet on foot. In hilly and mountainous countries they travel much on the highest ground, and have regular ""crossings,"" where the experienced hunter or trapper often makes a kill or catch. Foxes are carnivorous--living on flesh. Their principal food consists of rabbits, squirrels, mice, birds, bugs, eggs, etc. In some places where the food named is not plenty they visit creeks, lakes and ponds hunting crabs and fish. While they prefer fresh meat, they take stale and even decayed meats in severe weather. Most wild animals can be attracted a short distance by ""scent"" or ""decoy,"" and the fox is one of them. Several good recipts for scent are given, but if there are no foxes in your neighborhood you can use all the ""scents"" and ""decoys"" you wish on a hundred traps all season without making a catch. There is no ""decoy"" that will attract a fox a mile, but there are some that are good. That many of the writers made good catches is bourn out by the various photographs, and in some instances by personal visits by the author to the trapper. Foxes should not be trapped or shot until cold weather. In the states bordering on Canada about November 1st, while to the north they become prime sooner, while to the south they do not become prime until later. The pelt should be cased, that is skinned without ripping, and drawn upon a board. Several tacks or small nails can be used to hold the skin in place. Leave on the board only two to five days, according to the weather. When removed, turn fur side out. In drying, keep in a cool shady place and free from smoke. The number caught and killed annually is not known, but of the various kinds--red, grey, cross, white, etc.--it is several hundred thousand. [Illustration: ALMOST DRY ENOUGH TO TURN.] The following letters cover trapping and snaring pretty thoroughly, and all who read carefully and set their traps according to directions (if there are any foxes) will probably be successful. While the No. 2 Newhouse, which is a double spring, is known as the fox trap, the No. 1 1/2 single spring will hold the animal. We have known of several instances where fine ""reds"" were caught in a No. 1 trap. In those instances, however, the trap was fastened to a loose brush and every time the fox made a lunge the brush gave. In using the larger size, we advise using a brush or clog that will give with every pull or jump of the fox. Traps should be visited every other day, if possible, but never go only near enough to see that nothing has been disturbed. Owing to the wide distribution of the fox and the fact that they often have crossings near buildings so that their tracks are seen, etc., makes many inexperienced trappers think the number of animals larger than it really is. The fact that foxes travel during the coldest weather as well as any other time, gives the trapper an opportunity to show his skill when such animals as bear, coon, skunk, opossum and muskrat are ""denned up."" Fox skins at such times are at their best. As mentioned elsewhere, the greater per cent of the methods published in this book are taken from the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, an illustrated monthly magazine, of Columbus, Ohio, devoted to Hunting, trapping and raw furs. New trapping methods are constantly being published in that magazine, as experienced trappers from all parts of North America read and write for it. CHAPTER II. BAITS AND SCENTS. I prefer cat or muskrat for bait, says G. W. Asha. Cut it in pieces as large as an egg, place it in a perfectly clean can, zinc, screw cover, place it in the sun, allowing the bait to taint. This must be done in July or August, or can be done about two weeks before using. In regard to using scents, many don't believe scent is a help to trappers, but I'm one that believes in scent, because if there's a heavy rain storm it takes the scent from the bait. If a little scent is added, your bait is fresh again. Even heavy frosts have the same effect in this case. You have seen advertisements saying that scents will call an animal a mile. Don't take any stock in it, because any animal can't smell at the most only a few hundred feet away if the wind is right, not half as far if the wind is not right. If any of you are beginners trapping fox, scent is a great help, if you happen to tuck anything around the trap that have effect, if a little scent is added. A fox can smell only one thing at a time. If the scent is stronger than human scent, they will not smell the human scent. Too many accidents in this way have their effect because the fox is a forest animal in existence. I use for fall trapping the fox pure skunk glands and pure strained honey (not sugar fed honey) but clover or flower honey. Winter scent, pure matrix from the female fox taken in the running season during the heat, a little muskrat musk and pure strained honey. This scent attracts the male fox and is the strongest scent in existence. [Illustration: VERMONT HUNTER AND FOX SKINS.] Here is a first class fox decoy which can be made very easily, write Irving Brown, of Vermont. Take one half pint of skunk oil and the musk glands of a muskrat and one scent bag of a skunk, and you have the celebrated scent of Schofield, one of the first water set fox trappers in the East. This should be made in spring, but it is all right made at any time. It is not the best scent, however, but it is a most excellent one. Here is the secret of the best and it is hard to prepare because you cannot get the female fox in the running season, which is February or March, in this climate very easily. Take the matrix of a female fox taken in the running season or, in other words, cut out the entire sexual organs and place them in a pint of alcohol, and the result will be the best scent ever made. Some do not use alcohol but salt the matrix. This is the scent you will buy the secret for $5.00, and you will be told that foxes are just crazy to get it. This is in a measure true, but a red fox will not step into a trap unless you use care in setting it, with any kind of scent. I don't care how frantic a fox is to get at the bait. They don't commit suicide if they know it. There are many other ways to prepare for both mink and fox, all of them possessing merit, but my aim is to give the best, not those which are no use to the trapper. The more simple, as a rule, are the best. Some trappers are opposed to the use of scent, but you will find that man far behind others. The capture of fur bearing animals has become a science, as mink and fox become more wary so does man become more skillful in overcoming their shyness. We hear lots of secrets that were learned of the Indians. No doubt they had some good ones too, but the white trapper in the same place will outdistance any Indian I have ever seen or heard of. My experience among those people is that they are too lazy to use the care that a white man will use in either setting traps or stretching skins. * * * I have had a fox get into my snowshoes tracks and follow a long way because it was better traveling, says M. H. McAllister. Now that shows he was not afraid of human scent. Now about iron. How often does a fox go through a wire fence, or go near an old sugar house where there are iron gates? That shows he is not afraid of scent of iron. Once there was an old trapper here, and the young men wanted him to show them how to set a fox trap, and he told them he would. So he got them out to show them how, and this is what he told them: ""Remove all suspicion and lay a great temptation."" Well, there it is. Now, in order to remove all suspicion you must remove all things that are not natural. A man's tracks and where he has been digging around with a spade or with his hands are not natural around a spring, are they? No. Well then, there is where the human scent question comes in. By instinct he is shown that man is his enemy, and when a man has pawed the bait over he uses his sense and knows that there is danger, for it is not natural. [Illustration: LEFT FOR THE FOXES TO DEVOUR.] Now I have a question at hand. In one place he is not afraid and around the trap he is afraid. Now, how does he know when to be afraid or not? I think because when he sees a piece of bait in a new place it is not natural. Once last winter I knew where there was a dead horse and I used to go by it, and one day my brother was with me and of course he knew I could get a fox there, so to please him I set a trap, and not another fox came near. Well I smoked that trap, boiled it in hemlock and then smeared it with tallow, but the fox knew and never came within ten feet of it again, when they were coming every night before. When I went by there before I set my trap I left as much scent as after, and how could he tell when there was a foot of snow blown there by the wind after I set my trap. Now they don't appear to be afraid of human scent or iron in some places and around a trap they are, so now why should they know where to be shy? Well, because it may be in an unnatural place, unless it is instinct or good sharp sense. As for scent, I know that rotten eggs and onions are not natural, although the matrix of the female fox in the running season is very good. Also such as skunk or muskrat scent or fish, as it smells rotten and makes a strong smell. One word to the novice fox trapper, and I will leave space for something more valuable. You must make things look natural around the spring and smell natural, and put before them the food that God has provided for them, and you will have success by placing the trap in the mud of the spring, and putting a sod on the pan of the trap that has not been handled by the hand of a human being. CHAPTER III. FOXES AND ODOR. Last winter I could not trap much because the river along which I do my trapping and the woods all around were full of lumbermen, and I was afraid my traps would be stolen. I did a little experimenting on foxes in their relations to the odor of man and iron, says Omer Carmerk, of Quebec. The results of my experiences confirmed my previous observation that foxes are not afraid of the odor of iron, neither of the odor of man, but mighty suspicious of a bait connected with both odors. I made a trail about two miles long, scattered about it pieces of meat, chicken, rabbit, cheese, etc. I dragged a dead chicken, but I set no trap. Prior to my baiting the trail foxes were crossing it and following it without hesitation, but after I had put out the bait not a fox had ventured to cross that trail again. One day I saw where a fox had come near the trail, stopped, wheeled about and bounded off like a frightened deer. Another day, a fox tried to cross it at three different places but could not summon up enough courage, and at last, by making a long detour he crossed it at a place where there was no bait, not 20 yards from my cabin. One time a fox walked parallel to the trail several rods, then came nearer to it, stopped and turned back at full speed. The same foxes which were so afraid of my trail were going every night on the public road to eat horses. [Illustration: A GOOD RUNNER.] I will now relate one instance showing that the foxes smell traps. One day I chopped a chicken on a log. I threw the big pieces in the middle of three traps I had set the week before and left many small pieces on the log. The day after the snow around and on the log was all tramped down by foxes. One fox walked towards the big piece of meat, and when about two inches from a trap he stopped and turned back. I have no doubt he smelled the trap. When the traps are in the snow or wet ground the oxidation of iron produces a peculiar odor noticeable even to the human nostrils. One day I was going to look at a trap in a swamp road. My dog was trotting ahead of me, and when about ten feet from the trap he stopped and turned around. He detected the odor of the trap for he had not seen me set it, and he had good reasons to avoid it because when young he had often been pinched. Perhaps my experience does not harmonize with that of other trappers, but the ways of foxes as well as other animals are much influenced by their surroundings. I have observed that foxes frequenting the neighborhood of farms are less suspicious than those living in the deep woods. * * * For years, says a Southern trapper, I have invariably caught my fox, whether in a path, water or bait set; but can I swear my success is attributable to my extreme precaution? I always smoke traps to kill the smell of iron then handle them and everything around the setting with gloves, to erase human scent. I have found the summer and early fall months the best time to locate the haunts of the fox, as they are sure to use the same territory in the winter season. While on one of my recent investigating tours, a few days after a rain, I observed some facts that will be interesting. I struck an old road running through a farm, and readily noticed some fox tracks. Naturally I followed on and found they led under a wheat harvester, which had been recently left in the road and on under an iron gate, into the pasture beyond. All know that a harvester is largely constructed of iron and steel. Now if the fox is so afraid of this metal, as is supposed, does it seem reasonable that he would walk under such a mass of iron, or under an iron gate? In fox trapping the smoking and smearing process is advocated as well as the handling with gloves and concealing under the ground. In the light of my observations, are all these precautions absolutely necessary? On this same trip, in question, I noticed a fox track, and as usual followed it. To my surprise the animal went within a hair's breadth of a plow, passing right on, seemingly not either to care for red paint or iron construction. How is it, fox trappers? Does the iron and steel used in farm implements differ from that used in steel traps, so that the latter must be handled with such care as is advocated by many of the trapper's profession? Or is it the covering of the trap with earth that arouses suspicion? A red or grey fox will cross through or under a wire fence over the public highway at night, although the roads are continually traversed by the iron bound shoes of the horse. Even the tracks of man are visible here yet we, when trapping, brush out our tracks with great care. I have known a fox to follow where a plow has been dragged and have seen his tracks in the iron marked groove, just made by the locked wheel of a wagon. Considering these facts, does it seem possible that the fox has so great an antipathy to iron and to the human scent as supposed? (We believe that the conditions under which these are found have much to do with the foxes shrewdness. A wagon wheel or binder never caught a fox, but the scent coming from a trap--well that is different. Coming down to this would appear that the fox has some reasoning power or intellect.--Editor.) CHAPTER IV. CHAFF METHOD, SCENT. Get some chaff, a bushel will do, and put it out in some good place where there are foxes, writes a Maine trapper, J. F. Miller. Put some small pieces of meat in the chaff, (skunk, muskrat or cat is good), and take a shingle and pound the bed down solid all over. Don't have any soft place in the bed, and don't handle any of the chaff with bare hands, or the bait either. Leave it in this shape until you go on, then get your trap ready to set, but you want your trap clean and free from rust, and this is a good way to do. Scrape with an old knife, then use a clean pan and boil in clean water for twenty minutes, and no fox can smell your trap. Set in edge of bed and cover in good shape, and make it look as natural as possible, and don't walk all around in snow, stand in one place and walk in same tracks when you visit this place, and don't go only every other day. Now I will tell you of a good way to make a scent that will draw a fox to a trap. It will draw a fox a number of yards, but it will not draw them one mile or one half mile, and I doubt if it will one fourth mile, or any other scent that was ever made or ever will be. That is my idea of scents, but I know that they are good to draw animals to traps; they are like methods, some are better than others. This is not the best, but it is good. Take a cat, skunk and muskrat in April, dress them and chop them up fine and put them all in a glass jar. Put cover on and set them where it is warm so they will rot in good shape, and in the fall add a little fish oil and you will have something that will smell right loud. [Illustration: SOME PET FOXES.] Most anything that will smell strong is good scent, but no matter how good your bait and scent is, you must have the trap so the fox can't smell it, and know how and where to set it. Don't forget to set your trap where there are foxes. This is one thing to keep in mind, always set where you see signs. Some think they can set a trap any old way and place, and ought to make a catch, and then get discouraged. If you don't get your game the first night try again and keep right on trying; it is courage and grit that makes a successful trapper. Look for signs whenever you are in the woods, and study them and the animals that you want to catch. I always look up places in summer, and when the time comes to set traps I know just where every trap is going and how many I want. I tried a great many times to catch a fox before I was successful. I remember one time I got an old horse for fox bait in winter, and put him in a good place. We had a snow storm a few days afterwards, and boylike I started with my rabbit dog and gun to look for rabbits and to take a look at my old horse to see if the foxes had begun to feed on him, and when I got to him he was a sight to behold. The snow was all trodden down solid around him where they had circled and stood around and fed on him. That was too much for me. It took the rabbit fever all out of me for that day, and I started for home to get six No. 2 1/2 Newhouse traps to set around the horse, and I could not get home quick enough to suit me. I had always wanted to catch a fox so bad and I thought the time had come. I set them as well as I could and covered them up good, as I thought, and went home. It seemed to me that morning would never come. I knew I was going to have a fox, so I was up early and started after it. When I got almost to the bait I saw new tracks going towards the horse and that made my heart beat a little faster, as I was sure I had one, but they had gone as near as three feet and that was as near as they would go. They knew the traps were there as well as I did, and they never went there as long as my traps were set. CHAPTER V. TRAPS AND HINTS. My idea is that manufacturers make traps too strong for the animal it is made for, says C. F. Keith. Now the No. 2 is too strong for fox, and also it is very hard to conceal from view. Of course if you get a fox in a No. 2 you are more sure than if he is caught in a No. 1 1/2 or smaller. I use the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse for fox and I find it the best fox trap made. I have also used the Jump and the Blake & Lamb, but I do not like them as well. Some trappers think that the Blake & Lamb are the best mink traps made. I beg leave to differ with them, for the simple reason that I have lost many a mink by the trap cutting off the leg and the mink escaping, which never happens with the Newhouse. The Blake & Lamb trap are, without doubt, the best trap to conceal, but when it comes to be the best trap it is not in it with the Newhouse. I think if trappers would use long chains when using clogs, they would have better luck in trapping the fox. The kind of traps I use are the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse for fox, with four foot chains. When I first began to trap fox I used cheap traps, and many a fox have I lost by not knowing enough to use good traps. By all means, trappers, buy good traps in the first place and you will not be sorry. [Illustration: SILVER AND BLACK FOX SKINS.] Now let me first give you a few pointers on fox trapping. First, forget everything you have bought from humbugs and use common sense; second, study the habits of the fox and you will have better success. Third, be sure and have your traps in proper shape so the fox can't smell the iron; fourth, be careful in making a set, use the wooden paddle or gloved hand in placing dirt over trap; fifth, be sure that your bait is not scented with human scent, and use cat, skunk, or muskrat scents. I have bought scent for many years, but the best scent I can find is skunk essence or oil of anise. Skunk essence and honey equal parts, but never use skunk essence in early winter, as it will be a failure. I have trapped fox for many years and I am very successful and lucky, and every fall I believe I learn something. Another thing, never get discouraged, for it is grit that counts. When a fox turns the trap over reset it and place another trap in the bed, and you are liable to catch him the first night, but if this fails, turn trap bottom side up and he will get fooled, sometimes, not always, for fox trapping is uncertain. In the first place, when an animal gets into a trap he tears around for a while, says G. F. Moon, of Dakota, and if the trap be lightly clogged so he can move around, the trapper most generally finds his game when he visits the traps. On the other hand, let the trap get fastened solid and the animal sets his reasoning powers to work; he finds out that he can chew from the under side of the jaws of the trap, and that too without giving himself any pain, and finds that he can easily slip the trap off from the stump of his leg. Man has been known to do the same thing, when by accident he has been caught by the leg by a tree or a large rock falling on him. Surely the animal showed as much reason as the man. I once had a large fox trap set in a hollow log. The log was about the size of a barrel. A she fox got into the trap, and as the trap was a good bit out of the way I did not visit it for several days. When I did visit the trap the snow was all tramped down by foxes around the log and on the inside of the log by the fox in the trap. There were the remains of several rabbits and one whole rabbit fresh killed, one fresh killed quail and feathers enough to have been on a couple more quail. Now the question arises, ""Did the other foxes let instinct guide them to feed the unfortunate fox in the trap? Or did they use their power of reason?"" I leave that for others to answer. [Illustration: LIVE SILVER FOX.] CHAPTER VI. ALL ROUND LAND SET. I have made a close study of the red fox for years and the all round land set is one of my best and latest sets, says J. H. Shufelt, of Canada. First used last year and took 15 red foxes, and when properly and carefully set, is the most killing method I ever used. How to make the scent--This scent should be made in August, of house cat, muskrat or skunk, chopped fine and put in a two quart glass jar and sealed until it forms a liquid, and should fill the jar two-thirds full. Two weeks before using put in the musk of one skunk, one oz. oil of amber, and enough skunk oil to nearly fill the jar; get a new paint brush, a small one will do, and see that it is clean, to use scent with, and it should be kept in the jar. How to fix trap--I prefer a waxed trap. I find a smoked trap will rust on the under side after setting about a week. It's not so with a waxed trap. If properly waxed, water will not rust them. Take a large kettle of hot water and keep it boiling hot. Melt your beeswax in a cup or dish and pour on the water; now take your traps, six at a time, and dip them, and the wax will adhere to them; just leave the traps in the water long enough to warm them a little, when the wax will spread evenly over them; drain over kettle and hang up to dry a week before using. One half pound of wax is sufficient for three dozen traps and chains and will last one trapping season. [Illustration: NOVEMBER CATCH.] How to set the trap--I use rubber boots and set in the morning when the dew is on the grass or on a wet day. The set should be made near the foxes' runways or on high ground; dig out a place the size of your trap, take something with you to put the trap and dirt on--for this purpose I use a piece of oil cloth, two feet square--fill all around outside of your trap with fine dirt, and put a large leaf over your trap. I use a large leaf from a first growth basswood. As soon as they fall from the tree I gather them and lay them flat together in the mud until I want them to use. Why I prefer this particular kind of leaf is, they grow so large that one leaf covers the trap. After the leaf is over your trap cover with fine dirt or something that must be in keeping with the surroundings. Now stand in one place and take your brush from the jar and paint a circle about two feet in diameter, the width of your brush on the grass all around your trap. This should be repeated once or twice a week, especially after a heavy rain storm. Nothing can steal your bait, John Sneak'um cannot locate your trap. When visiting your traps carry an extra trap along, and when you make a catch set a clean trap by exchanging traps; always clean your trap after making a catch before setting again. Now boys, start in right, by using a good trap with a large pan, one that can be easily concealed. Don't try to catch a fox with a weak trap, for you will only be disappointed and at the same time be educating another fox, and he will make the rest shy, for they often travel in pairs. When making your sets, don't disturb anything around the place nor use a bush drag where there hasn't been one, for the fox is quick to notice. Use a grapple that can be concealed under your trap. Just try and see how slick a set you can make and try and learn the habits of the animal you are trying to catch, for that is the key to success. CHAPTER VII. SNOW SETS. Much has been said pro and con relative to trapping that most wary of our wild animals, the red fox. A few incidents pertaining thereto that have come under my observation may be worthy of mention, says J. A. Newton, of Michigan. There are practically three conditions under which trapping the fox may be done. First, by setting in beds, so called, of dry chaff or ashes before snow falls; secondly, in snow during the coldest weather, and lastly spring water setting as some writers have described. I shall confine myself to the two first mentioned conditions. In the first instance a spread of chaff or ashes covering three or four feet of space is made where foxes are known to travel. As a rule the most acceptable bait is lard scraps, suet, smoked meat rinds, etc. These are scattered in small bits in the bed, and as a lure nothing can be more efficacious than a few drops sprinkled in the bed composed of the female fox gland taken in the rutting season that has been dissolved in alcohol. It must be kept tightly corked. The same taken from the female dog at this period is about as potent. The traps must first be thoroughly smoked with some resinous twigs or corn cob, or be boiled in ashes to eradicate the scent of iron, rust, and of other game that has been caught. After this do not handle traps or bait except with gloves. [Illustration: AWAITING THE TRAPPER.] All old trappers in my section bait a fox a few nights before placing the trap, as the more visits Reynard makes to the bed, and devouring bait without having his suspicions aroused, the more reckless does he become and the easier is he taken when at last the trap is placed. One old trapper, who is very successful, does not set his traps until some night when the first snowfall is at hand. The new white mantle covers the bed and all human sign made in setting the trap. The clog should have been previously placed some days before so that the fox will become accustomed to the sight of it. The fox has not forgotten the exact location of the bed with its tidbits and comes to it with unerring precision even when covered by snow, and unless he by good luck kicks the trap over and springs it he now comes to grief. Old man Titus says: ""Having nailed the game don't kill on the spot but drag him off a ways. Then don't leave the carcass lying round conspicuous or it will scare the rest out of the neighborhood."" My first insight into the manner of snow trapping I gained from a man named Williams. Several of his sheep concluded to part company with this cold unappreciative world, and their owner determined to make them still serve a purpose. Hauling them off in as many directions as there were of the dead, he left them until deep snow and severe weather came, cutting off much of the natural prey of the fox which reduced him to seeking carrion. After their inroads on the bait had become well established, Williams placed a trap at each of the remains, covering a little snow over them and stapling to pieces of fence rails previously placed. ""Now,"" said Williams, ""the only thing to do is to keep away from here two or three days until a little more snow falls to cover our sign, or is drifted a little by the wind."" He used no scent of any kind, saying that ""starvation is the best lure in the world."" ""All I do is to smoke the traps and not handle barehanded,"" he added. After two or three days of snow flurrying weather we visited the traps and noted that one was missing. We could see a dim trail where it had been dragged away. We followed and found the fox in a drift. He was poor and had frozen hard. Five were taken at the sheep bait inside of two weeks, after which there came a thaw stopping further snow trapping. One old trapper tells of a fox that came near outwitting him, being not only the most cunning but also possessing a degree of meanness almost satanic. ""I baited him in a bed of chaff several nights,"" said he, ""and then set my trap. The trap could not have contained scent, but the old chap appeared to know it was there; he carefully nosed out and devoured every scrap of bait, and then as deftly dug the trap out, turned it over and sprung it and left a soiling evidence of his scorn and contempt for me upon it. That I was mad you needn't doubt for a minute. I tried setting three and four traps, hoping he'd make a miscue and get into some one of them, but no, he was too smart, he sprung them all each night and insulted me besides. All at once the thought struck me like a brick, I'll set the trap bottom side up. This I did, removing all the traps but one. ""The cat came back"" and as before turned the trap, bringing it right side up. I had set it full catch so that it would spring rather hard. He slipped a cog in not taking into account that the trap didn't spring when he turned it; when bestowing his disdain a too close contact brought a sharp click and he was fast. I never saw so sneaking and beat out an animal in my life. He would like to have had the ground open up and swallow him if it could."" An acquaintance of mine who is a settler in Northern Michigan heard a great squealing and commotion among his hogs one night late in November, and bounced out just in time to see a large bear drop one of his shoats as it passed through the bars. The porker was stone dead, being bitten through the nape of the neck. The settler, whose name is Clark, drew the pig into the woods and left it between two fallen trees. With his axe he chopped a niche large enough to contain a trap, when set, from each of the logs; a piece of moss was carefully fitted over each cavity and all of the chips were removed. Foxes there are very numerous, and Clark soon noticed that the bait was being sampled; he knew the fox nature in that they have a habit of walking logs or on the highest points when investigating an attraction. When the tracks to and from and circling the bait became frequent Clark placed a trap on each log, covering them neatly with patches of moss; the chain was fastened to clogs concealed under the logs, and the chains were hidden with strips of moss. Upon his first visit to the traps, two days later, the trapper found a fox in each trap, and several more were taken before crows and other scavengers had polished the bones of the bait. [Illustration: AFTER THE CHASE.] On the quiet, boys, I will say that it requires so much preparation, caution and patience to successfully trap the red fox that I have more frequently resorted to the hound and shotgun; by this means I have often taken the jacket of a cunning old dog fox, after running him over the hills an hour or two, that it would have taken much time and patience to trap. After one gets the runways learned, and if he possesses a good gun that loads properly, and is a tolerably fair shot at running game, the means is much quicker. It is like digging out a nest of skunks as against the slow process of trapping one at a time. * * * I had a little experience with a sly old female fox last winter, says Claude Roora, of Ohio. I had noticed on early snows where this old fox had two holes under an old rail fence where she would pass through every night, and also a stone beside a sheep path where she would stop. I picked out those three places to set traps for her under the next snow. One morning I thought it looked as though it was fixing for a snow. I got three No. 2 Victor traps and told my wife I was going to catch that old fox that night if it snowed. I went to the three places and was very careful not to tear things up any more than just to dig places the size of the traps. I had grapnels fastened to chains and dug holes deep enough to bury them, so that when the traps were set on top of them it would be just a little below level of the surface of the ground, and covered all up with dead grapevine leaves. About the time I got the last trap set it commenced snowing and quit snowing before dark. [Illustration: TRAP AND GRAPNEL.] Next morning I went early to get my fox before the hound men got out, thinking sure I would have her. When I got within one hundred yards of set No. 1 I saw her tracks leading straight to it. She went up within five or six feet of the trap, turned short off to the right and went down to set No. 2, went up within five or six inches of trap where she turned short off to the right again, made a few jumps down the hill, jumped over top of fence, circle back up the hill to sheep path, followed it out to set No. 3. She went up to this trap, raked every bit of snow and leaves off of trap and left trap bare and in plain sight, not even springing trap. I covered trap up again thinking I might fool some other fox, but in about half an hour the hounds came along on her track and one of them set his foot in the trap and his owner let him loose and threw the trap away. The hounds followed the fox up over the hill, routed it and ran it about an hour and holed it under a big rock, and the men went off and left it. Now the hounds had been in the habit of holing this fox under the same rock, and the most of us know that when a pack of hounds hole a fox they generally tear things up some. In other words, they leave some signs. I set the traps as nice as I knew how, and when I went back the next morning traps were turned upside-down and fox gone. So I concluded I would follow the track and see if I couldn't find her asleep and shoot her, but had not gone far when I found the snow had drifted so I could not follow her. I came back home discouraged. Next morning I thought I would go and see if she had been back on the hill. When I got to set No. 2 I saw where she had come up from the opposite side from what she had been in the habit of doing and stuck her right foot square in the trap. She went about one hundred yards where she got tangled in some grapevines and was waiting for me. Now I think there are instances where the scent of steel or human scent will scare animals away from your sets, and when you mix them both together they are a sure warning of danger with all shy animals. Now if this fox did not locate that trap at set No. 3 with her nose I would like to know how she did it, for I removed every bit of dirt I took out to make set and left all level and two and a half inches of snow ought to make things look as natural as any fox could expect to find a set, and at a rock where she had been in the habit of seeing things torn up by the dogs when she came out on previous occasions, and traps hidden out of sight, her nose surely told her where they were set. CHAPTER VIII. TRAPPING RED FOX. In the many years that he has been striving for his glossy pelt, man has evolved numerous clever schemes for outwitting the fox, but in the meantime Reynard has not been an idle observer regarding the ways of the human enemy, says J. L. Woodbury, of Maine. He lacks the advantage of books or tradition for handing down his store of accumulated knowledge, but in some mysterious way it is transmitted from generation to generation, nevertheless. So it is that the fox of the older and more thickly settled sections is a very different animal from the fox--even though it be of the same variety or species--inhabiting a part of the country where its kind has not been so persistently hunted. Tricks that prove effective with the latter are utterly lost on his better-schooled brother. Hence the simple methods advanced by some trappers are a bit amusing to the trappers here in the East, where the subject of this sketch reaches the acme of wisdom, and is, we believe, the peer in shrewdness and cunning of any animal in the world. However, we do not wish to be understood as ridiculing anybody's methods. We read the crudest of them with interest, realizing that they are all right in the region whence they came. [Illustration: CAUGHT IN MAINE.] I would advise the amateur fox trapper to begin with the water set if practicable. Nearly any one of the many different forms are good enough, with such modifications as will be found necessary to adapt it to varying conditions of different sets. As one should not begin operations until freezing weather, spring water should be selected for the trap. A good-sized spring works best, but if this is not to be had, utilize some of the little springs to be found in plenty near the sources of brooks. One with a dark bottom is to be preferred, as then there will be no sand to clog the trap, which may be pressed down into the mud until it is all hidden but the pan. This should be about an inch under the water, and covered with a lump of moss. The position of trap with relation to bait has so often been explained I need not dwell upon it here. If the spring be a large one it is easy to place the bait so that it will be protected by water on all sides save the one desired, but if a smaller pool be employed the side opposite the trap should be barricaded with stumps or brush; which work, by the way, had better be done some time during the previous summer. And rather than leave too narrow an approach to the bait if is better to set two or even more traps, for reynard's suspicions are quickly aroused by anything resembling an inclosure. As to the matter of bait, it may be said in general that foxes like about all kinds of meat. Yet the task of selecting a killing bait is not always as easy as might be expected from this, as individuals seem to have their particular preferences, while the morsel that would be eagerly sought by the same fox at one season will have no attraction for him at another. If you find ""signs"" in the vicinity of your sets, yet they remain unmolested, experiment with different kinds of baits, as the angler tries a variety of flies at every likely-looking pool. It is certain that mice, rabbits and grouse are among the best baits. For the ""scent"" part, some trappers claim to do well without them, but a good scent is unquestionably a great help. Many of those for which receipts are given I know to be effective. But the most tempting bait and the strongest lure will jointly prove unavailing if one's set be unskillfully made, and carelessness be practiced in going to and from trap. Water, of course, leaves no scent where it is possible to reach the set by boat or wading, but where this is impracticable arrange to go to trap but rarely, if it remain undisturbed. The height of springs vary but little with wet or dry weather, and this fact should be taken full advantage of by the fox-trapper. Carefully select a trap that will not spring of itself. See that the trigger is pushed well into the notch, pick out a good, close-fibred piece of moss for pan, not large enough to clog the jaws, and stick a few small twigs around it to hold it in place. Push the chain well down into the mud, have the bait exactly in the right place, and in fact use every care to have things fixed so that they will not be disarranged by trivial causes. Then in visiting, go no nearer than is necessary to see that bait or trap have not been disturbed. Skunks will often prove a great bother, as they take all kinds of bait and kick up no end of a ""bobbery"" when caught. The fact that their pelts pay the bill in part is but poor consolation, when one has just got a particularly shy old red coat about worked up to the ""biting"" point. Sometimes one will run upon natural conditions particularly favorable for a set--a rock, islet or piece of drift in mid-channel, or an old log spanning the stream. Experienced trappers are quick to note all such places as these, as well as points where, with a very little human handiwork, traps may be placed to advantage. It is best to make all essential preparations as long before setting as possible, though bearing in mind that the streams are usually much higher in the trapping season than during the summer. Also begin putting out baits some time before setting traps. No animal exercises afterward the same degree of caution as on the first two or three visits to a spot, and even so shy a creature as the fox, if he become accustomed to picking up a few choice bits at a place, will soon neglect much of his usual precaution in approaching it, and though he take alarm and shun it for a time will ere long get up sufficient confidence to renew his visits. If you find where there is a burrow with a family of young foxes, watch them all you can during your leisure moments. Learn where they get their food, where they cross the streams, and their general lines of travel. True, the family may be broken up and driven to sections miles away before time for trapping, but nevertheless a few traps should be placed in the old beats, as if one of this family should ever return to the vicinity he will be certain to revisit his former haunts. Many trappers, and especially young trappers, expect to get a fox the first night, and, as it would seem, think to make their set so that not the slightest taint of man or iron lingers about the spot after they leave it. They boil their traps in this or that, or smear them with some odorous substance (the very thing perhaps to draw the game's attention to them); they handle them gingerly with gloves (which are often as strongly imbued with man smell as their naked hands); strap hides, pieces of board or snow shoes to their feet when setting or visiting, and in fact go through a rigmarole that would require about half a day to set a single trap. Then they think that if the shyest old fox imaginable should come along that night he would walk into their snare as confidently as a cow into a stall, or a man into his own house. Without reflecting upon the methods of any one, we must say that we consider many of these expedients unnecessary, unless when dealing with an unusually shrewd customer. For my own part we make but little reckoning on a trap for the first two or three days, especially one with bait. Sometimes, of course, a storm helps us out, or we may nab a youngster who is green at the game; but this is an exception, not the rule. We take all needful precautions in respect to disturbance and scent, but our chief aim is to secrete and cover our trap well; to cover it so that no smell or iron can possibly reach the surface, and so that it will remain covered for weeks if necessary, and yet be ready for business, let the weather be what it will--snow or rain, heat or cold. Herein lies the essence of the art; to fix your trap so that it will not soon require your attention, then nature will speedily dispose of whatever scent you may have left about it. We are speaking now chiefly of land sets. In looking up a place for a set, select one if possible where some natural or artificial provision will admit of approach without leaving much scent--a hard-beaten path, a double stone wall, a line of ledges, or a combination of some such conditions, which should be invariably followed in going to and from trap. [Illustration: CAUGHT BY A MISSOURI TRAPPER.] When you have decided upon the place for a trap, make all possible preparations at a distance; then go to the spot and do your work as quickly and cleanly as you can. If the ground is soft, use a strip of board to stand on. If you use gloves, have some especially for the purpose, and never leave them lying about your dog's quarters or the house. It will do no hurt to smear them lightly with whatever you are using for scent. See that the trap rests evenly and firmly, so that if any part of it be stepped on it will not tip and pull apart the covering, or grate upon rocks or the chain. Make your excavation quite deep, filling in the bottom with some two inches of hemlock twigs or something of like nature, so as to prevent the gathering of moisture and a consequent freeze. Secure to a clog, or use a grapnel. The latter is in most cases preferable, as it may be buried from sight, while the former adds one more to the objects likely to arouse suspicion. The covering is something that you will pretty much have to learn for yourself. Like swimming, no one can teach it by any amount of talking; practice is necessary to acquire the trick. Moss, leaves and rotten wood are the principal materials used, though pinches of herbage and dirt may be added to harmonize with set and surroundings. Leaves, however, should be used sparingly, as they change shape with every phase of weather, and thus frequently spoil what would otherwise have remained a good covering. If well rotted they give less trouble in this respect, and offer less resistance to the jaws in closing. When using bait, if not setting in a bed, find a spot where little building is required to protect it--a hollow log or stump, the entrance to an old burrow, a niche in a ledge or hole under a rock. Sometimes, where a trout-stream flows under a step bluff, a little shelf is found in the face of the bluff (and one can usually be made if it is not already there); and by placing a trap on the shelf and the bait just above it, you have sly Mr. Fox at great disadvantage, as he must leap from the opposite side of the brook to the embankment to reach the bait. A projection in the face of a cliff, several feet from the ground, if it is inaccessible from overhead or either side may be similarly improved. Always be on the lookout for such places as these, where those sharp eyes and that keen, pointed nose will be kept at a distance from your set until it is too late for them to detect signs of danger. Old roads offer good possibilities for traps without bait. Unused plain roads, where the grass has sprung up may be practically covered by placing a trap in each wheel-rut and the central path. The space under a set of bars may be partly filled with brush and two or three traps placed side by side in the opening with good chances of success. We say two or three traps, as by so doing a larger opening may be left, which adds greatly to your chances. An attempt to coax this slippery fellow into narrow quarters quickly excites his suspicions. Cow and sheep paths are much traveled by reynard, especially those leading around and through swamps. These are more easily trapped than roads, a good method being to first go along the path with your decoy scent, applying at intervals to objects close beside the path, and then setting traps, without bait, between the ""doctored"" points. An old pelt of some sort dragged behind you will serve to kill your own scent, and to keep the intended victim to the path. As stated, an important element of successful fox trapping is to make as little disturbance, and to leave us little scent us possible, in working around, and going to and from trap. It follows then that one should not only aim so to fix his traps that they will require no actual attention under ordinary conditions of weather, except at considerable intervals, but should invariably locate them with a view to being able to look after them in a way not to arouse wily reynard's suspicions. [Illustration: WHITE FOX SKINS.] Sometimes, when trapping along a creek or other waters where it is not convenient to keep a boat, a rude raft may be constructed from which to make sets, and to be employed in visiting same. It simplifies the work one half to be able to do the whole thing by water, as water leaves neither scent nor trail. But where it is not possible to make use of this helpful agent, care should be taken to select a spot that can be approached over ledgy ground, or by jumping from rock to rock, two short strips of board to be stepped upon alternately, being often useful in bridging over any breaks that may occur in such line of approach. Where this method cannot be employed, owing to the nature of the ground, it is advisable to vary the route in visiting, as by always following the same line a well defined trail will soon be made, which is certain to excite suspicion in an animal as shy as the fox. When dealing with an unusually shrewd customer, some wear snowshoes or strap hide of some sort on the feet, either of which is not a bad plan, as well as that of dragging a fresh pelt behind one to obliterate one's trail. As to making beds of chaff, while I have no personal experience with this material, it never impressed me as being the proper thing for the purpose, as it is out of place in the woods or fields. If a man comes upon a pile of chaff any where away from buildings, it instantly occurs to him as being queer that it should be in such a place. Do you not suppose that the wild creatures, whose very existence depends upon their sharpness of observation, are likely to note the unfitness of the thing quicker than we? Of course, if the chaff be deposited in place early in the season, allowing time to discolor and decay, it may help the case, or feathers may be thrown over the bed. But in the latter event wind may at any time remove the covering. For myself, I have always had better luck in making sets for any animal with materials obtained from the immediate surroundings, and having therefore nothing foreign in smell or appearance to offend the creature's nose or eye. Now a few words as to the fox's regard for iron. Does he feel that it is a thing to be avoided or not? It is my belief, brother trappers, that he does, under certain circumstances, have a strong instinctive fear of metal of any kind. That is to say, when he finds it in places where as a rule it is not to be found. The fact that he will walk for miles on the railroad track, and even upon the rails, is no argument to the contrary, for the reason that he has become accustomed to the iron in such places. A large quantity does not alarm him, but a small piece, half hidden in the dirt, in field or wood where he is not accustomed to see it, awakes his distrust. For the same reason, he will trot deliberately out in the road in front of a passing team, when the mere snapping of a twig beneath the hunter's feet would send him off flying. He has learned that danger rarely comes to him from persons traveling by team; it is of the stealthy step and the swift act of raising a gun that instinct has taught him to stand in fear. And so it is with respect to iron. It is all right in its place, he knows, but he also knows that it is quite out of place--from his standpoint, at least--in proximity to his favorite articles of diet. Why even the stupid muskrat, who will go into people's cellars, and in fact most everywhere else he wants to, and who will walk into any sort of set so long as the trap be covered, will not step into a bare trap. Dozens of times have I had my dog follow the tracks one has made around my trap when it was left bare by falling water, but invariably the rat has left the bait rather than put his foot on the uncovered trap. It is absurd to think the thick-headed muskrat is sharper in any respect than wise Mr. Fox. [Illustration: A RHODE ISLAND SCENE.] CHAPTER IX. RED AND GREY. I will give a method for trapping the grey fox, and have to say trap him the same as the red fox, as any method that will take one will do for the other, says L. M. Pickens, of Tennessee. The trapper can easily tell which of these species he is setting for, as the grey fox has more of a round track, while his red brother leaves a much larger and longer imprint. Each of these animals are great rovers, starting on a forage by sunset, traveling many miles in a night; never holing up for the bitterest freeze that comes. Look for fox tracks in stock paths, old roads not much used, places under fences, washouts, and in large gullies, as such places are their travels, yet many other unnamed places suited risks for your traps may be found if one is closely looking around. Carry with you a hardwood stick, ready sharpened, with which to dig the pit for your traps, and dig this lengthwise with the path, (not across it), and deep enough so the trap will be just a little below level of surface; now place the trap in, cover over springs and around outside of jaws with dirt, and lay a piece of paper, flat leaves or a piece of cloth over jaws and pan, then pulverize some of the dirt you dug up, sprinkle over the trap 'till all is covered over good, then lay a dead weed or stick on each side of trap two or three inches away, which completes the set. [Illustration: GREY FOX.] When you fasten the trap, do not staple it, but wire the ring or end of chain to a bush you cut, one that the fox can drag a distance, which always leaves the same trap pit or hole in readiness for your trap, which should immediately be smoked, set right back for another fox which is sure to come along, and if you are careful he will he yours, as it all depends upon skillful setting and covering the trap chain. Have everything look as natural when you make the set as before, and I will guarantee the catch of every fox that comes along. Use none but the best trap, and a Newhouse No. 2 is recommended, handle it and everything about the set with gloves, learn to respect the cunning of a fox by cultivating a habit of standing in one place, always be careful not to spit, whittle or leave any paper about a trap. Don't use rusty traps, scour off the rust, and boil for thirty minutes in any green bark that will coat them; willow, walnut, or chestnut are good. Don't lay your traps around on the ground at your sets; better carry them in a satchel, sack or something strapped around your shoulders. Don't whittle or spit where you are making a set. Don't staple your traps, but cut and wire the chains to a green limb, one that the fox can drag a distance, and visit your traps regularly, avoiding any unnecessary company. The method recommended is only the ""path method,"" and to be used altogether without any bait or scents; as I believe the best results are obtained by just taking a fox unawares, and the whole secret is in choosing the place, then knowing just how to conceal the trap, and have everything as natural as possible when the set is made. Look for fox tracks in stock paths, in pastures, fields, and woods, in large gullies, washouts and places under fences, old roads not much used, sand bars along streams, and other places; always selecting a narrow place for your set; approaching such places with trap ready set and wired to the brush, then with ready sharpened hard wood stick, stop and stand in one place until trap is properly set, when you can just walk right on to the next place. Always dig the pit just the size of trap to be used, having the springs lengthwise in the path or trail--not across it--and just deep enough so the trap will be a little below the surface level when put in the pit. Cover over springs and around the outside of the jaws with dirt, lay a piece of paper over pan and jaws, or put fine moss, cotton, wool or dead grass inside of jaws and under pan; then haul on the fine dirt, just enough of it to thinly cover all, brush with a twig to level and complete the set by laying a couple of dead weeds, or small sticks, just haphazard like some two or three inches on each side of the trap. As soon as you kill your fox, reset the trap in the same pit, but if your brush drag is chewed up, replace it with a new one. In addition, if it is a female fox that is caught, kill it near a path or any good place where a set can be made and where you have lately noticed a fox's track; then conceal and secure your trap as before, and the chances are as good for you to catch one or more fox at this set. [Illustration: SACKING FOXES.] Now try this method all the way through and you will soon see that I am right. My brother set his first fox trap Dec. 9th and on the morning of the 10th had a large female red fox and killed it in a pasture near a path, and that night caught the largest dog fox I ever saw or heard of. He got both these foxes just exactly as the above method indicates. The dog fox weighed 19 pounds and its hide measured 5 ft. 5 inches on the board. The old fox had lots of gray hairs on his head, evidently an old timer. CHAPTER X. WIRE AND TWINE SNARE. Various are the ways being studied for the capture of the fox and other shy animals, says J. H. Shufelt, of Canada. Most every trapper has a particular method of his own. Years ago trappers thought it was necessary to set in water in order to be successful in catching foxes, but after a closer acquaintance with the ways of the fox, it was found that they were easily caught in a steel trap on dry land in many ways. At the present time the trapper has found a less expensive way of catching them with the snare. This method has many advantages, and when properly set is a sure thing. It takes in most of those old sly ones that have been nipped by steel traps, etc. The method shown here is only one of the many ways of the snare. Owing to the peculiar fastening of the snare, a powerful spring pole or weight can be used with a lighter wire. I use a copper or brass wire 1 gauge, with a foot or more slack between fastenings, which gives the spring pole a chance to instantly take advantage of the fox as soon as caught, when he will be caught up to the staple (which should be high enough from the ground so the fox will swing clear) and choked. I set my snares in paths where weeds or grass grow each side to hide the snare. The loop should be seven inches in diameter, ten inches from the ground. It is as well before trapping to get the fox to traveling a path by leaving some good scent along the path. This can be done by boring a three-fourths hole downward in a tree near the path and pour the scent in, which will last a long time. If the same care is used in setting snares as is used in trapping, I think the snare will catch more. They work well in cold weather, and some fine catches can be made after a snowfall with the snare. Then the fur will be good and prime. [Illustration: WIRE OR TWINE SNARE.] A--Spring pole. B--Staple. C--Two small nails driven in tree. (Three inch nail head, end down, with snare looped at each end with a foot of slack between. As soon as the D--three inch nail is pulled down, it will slip past the nail at top end, when spring pole will instantly take up the slack, also the fox, to staple and does its work.) E--Slack line or wire. F--Loop should be 7 inches in diameter and bottom of loop ten inches from the ground. Remarks--The nails should be driven above staple so it will pull straight down to release the snare fastening. * * * I may state that I learned all the best ways of setting traps for fox long ago from an old trapper, says A. H. Sutherland, of Nova Scotia. But I never bothered setting a trap for a fox in my life, for the reason that I can catch them with snares on bare ground much easier and cheaper than with traps. But on snow if I could get fox to take bait, I would try poison on him. I may add that the snare is good for other animals besides the fox, such as coon, skunk and wild cat. Go to a hardware store and get some rabbit wire and put about five strands of it together, and twist it just enough so that it will stay together nicely. Have a small loop on both ends and run one end through the other so as to make a noose of it. Next get some good twine, put a piece about 10 or 12 inches in length into the loop on the end of the snare, that is, the end that is going to be fastened. Now find a path in an old clearing or in the woods, and select a place where you think best to set your snare. Cut a stake about 2 feet long and 1 1/2 inches through, have a limb on the butt end of it almost 3/4 inch in length. Sharpen the small end of the stake and drive it in the ground, leaving about 10 or 12 inches above ground; then cut a nice little pole about an inch and a half at the butt end and sharpen it, trim off at about an inch at the top end and fasten your snare, or at least take your pole in both hands and force the butt end into the ground till it will be good and firm. Now bend down your pole and fasten your snare to it, and put the end of the pole under the catch on the stake. Be sure to drive your stake close enough to the path so as to have your snare light about the center of the path and the lower side of the snare about 8 inches from the ground. It is best to have them high enough so the fox cannot jump over them. Of course a man must use good judgment at setting snares just the same as he would in setting traps. Another good place is a brush fence. Find holes under it where the fox will be going through, put your snare there, and if there are any going you will have some of them. Next find a good stream in the woods or anywhere frequented by foxes, and if you find good trees that fall across the stream have a good sharp axe and give a good slash or two of the axe about the middle of the tree, or at least above the middle of the brook. As I was going to say, give a good slash or two of the axe lengthwise of the tree and make a wedge shape stake and drive it into the tree, and then fasten your snare to a spring pole. If you prefer, you could bore an auger hole in the log and drive your pin in that way, and fasten the snare to the pin about 10 or 12 inches from the log so that the snare will hang downwards, it will do better. Be sure and have the lower side of snare 7 or 8 inches from the log. [Illustration: THE WIRE LOOP.] Now there is another kind of brass or copper wire that one strand will be enough to hold a fox. If you find that they are cutting your snares put little rollers of wood in the snare boring a hole lengthwise with a 3/8 bit, and have the roller almost 5 inches long and say an inch in diameter. Put that on snare so it will run down to the side of his neck, and he will keep biting at it. I get No. 14 brass wire (mind, you must temper the wire) that I find the hardest part of the game. Cut your wire about 34 or 36 inches long, make it into rings round, put in a good hot fire for three or four minutes, or until red. Be very careful and not let it lie on coal, handle very carefully; don't strike against anything while hot, as it will break like glass, but if you have it tempered you cannot break it. I have caught three foxes in the same snare, says Larry Burns, of Canada. You must make your snare just the same as a rabbit snare, only make a loop about six inches around. Find when the fox passes under a fence or on a cow path, in winter, find where they make a habit of going. Set your snare in such places or around old carrion in bushes, cedar is best, use weeds rolled round your snare, don't use too many as they will notice. Use a green stick to hold your snare fast, You wire about a foot from large end. Always stand up the stick just the same as growing. The stick should be 1 1/2 inches thick. Be careful and make as few foot marks as possible and stand on one side of your snare. While setting don't spit tobacco juice near snare. * * * A great many foxes have been caught in this country by the plan of the drawing outlined, writes J. C. Hunter, of Canada. A--the snare, should be made of rabbit wire, four or five strands twisted together. Should be long enough to make a loop about seven inches in diameter when set. Bottom side of snare should be about six inches from the ground. E--is a little stick, sharp at one end and split at the other, to stick in the ground and slip bottom of snare in split end, to hold snare steady. [Illustration: SPRING POLE SNARE.] B--is catch to hold down spring pole. C--is stake. D--is spring pole. Some bend down a sapling for a spring pole, but we think the best way is to cut and trim up a small pole about ten feet long; fasten the big end under a root and bend it down over a crotch, stake or small tree. Snare should be set on a summer sheep path, where it goes through the bushes. Stake might be driven down a foot or more back from the path, where a branch of an evergreen bush would hang over it so as to hide it and a string long enough from stake or trigger to snare to allow snare to rest over path. Of course, in making this set you will have to use care and your own ingenuity to a great extent, to suit the requirements of the surroundings. Another way is to find a log, tree or pole that lies across a brook that is too wide for a fox to jump from one bank to the other. Set snare on log, but in this case, bottom side of snare should be only about four inches from log, as a fox will carry his nose lower while crossing a stream on a log. If the log is near the water, a spring pole should be used; if the log is high up from the water, fasten snare to log by driving in a wooden pin in the side of the log, and when the fox gets in snare he will tear around, fall off of log and hang all right. * * * The following is said to be the manner in which they snare foxes in New Brunswick: Early in the season they go into the woods in some favorable locality and build a fence. This place is similar to what would be constructed for partridge snaring, only of course with layer brush, leaving a narrow opening sufficiently wide for the passage of a fox, fixing everything just as they wish it to be later on when ready for business, and having a spring pole at such a distance that it can be utilized when wanted. Take a dead hen or some kind of meat, place it in a jar, so that it gets well tainted; that when the right time comes place the noose in place at the opening made in the fence, fasten to the spring pole, sprinkle a little of this tainted bait about, and await results. [Illustration: THE RUNAWAY SNARE SET.] In going and coming, wooden shoes or clogs are worn, so that the fox will not get the scent of the party setting the trap. An animal in coming down the path passes its body or neck through the loop made of stout insulated wire; in passing it steps on the trip stick which settles with the animal's weight, releasing the trigger, which in turn releases the stay-wire and jerks the loop around the animal; the spring pole onto which the stay-wire is attached lifts your game up into the air, choking it to death and placing it out of reach of other animals that would otherwise destroy your fur. A small notch cut in the stay crotch where the end of the trip stick rests will insure the trigger to be released. This will hold the trip stick firm at the end, making it move only at the end where the animal stops. New and valuable methods are continually being published in the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, an illustrated monthly magazine, of Columbus, Ohio. CHAPTER XI. TRAP, SNARE, SHOOTING AND POISON. Some say that scent is no good, and that they can trap more without it, and they even go so far as to offer to match their craft with those using it. I don't call myself a trapper, says E. R. Lafleche, of Canada, as I never spend much time at hunting or trapping. When I go in the woods it is only for a little recreation, and not being an old hunter, I do not know it all yet, but will say that I can get more than my share of foxes in any place here in Canada. For the benefit of the young as well as many old trappers I will give here my methods of trapping, snaring, shooting and poisoning the fox, which is as good, if not better, than any I have seen. I can clean the foxes out of any section of the country without having to purchase any of the so-called famous scent. To take away the human scent from whatever I do, I make a bath as follows: First, take 2 lbs. of male cedar branches, 2 lbs. balsam branches, and 1 lb. good hen manure; chop the branches fine and place the whole in a pot in 2 gallons of soft water, ""fresh rain water is the best"" and boil until reduced to 1 1/2 gallon. Second, take a clean pail or tub, smoke it with birch or balsam bark, then place solution, cover and keep in a temperate place. To make the scent, take equal parts of the following: Fresh eel, honey in comb, chicken, pig liver, mice; chop the whole together like mince meat and bottle, cork and place the bottle in a pail or tub of water so that it will float and in a warm place. A good way is to place the bottle in some shallow part of a lake, creek or river much exposed to the sun, and where the water is warm; use a strong bottle and fill about three-fourths of it, and remove the cork from time to time for fear the fermentation smashes the bottle, and as soon as it has settled, cork well and keep in a temperate place for a week or so, and it is ready for use. Smear your snowshoes and go where you like, and there will not be a single fox that will come to your trail that will not follow it to the end. To take the iron smell from traps, first clean them well in warm water. Second, put them in the bath for 10 or 12 hours. Third, smoke them with birch and balsam bark; then they are ready to set, Place the trap 18 inches from the bait and put a few drops of the medicine under the pan of the trap, get a small shovel made of sieve wire, and sieve some snow over the trap and over your signs up to three feet or more from your bait. Don't spit or monkey with pipe and tobacco. Place your bait near a large stone, stump, fence or tree, and in such a way that the fox will be able to approach the bait from side where the trap is; always set the trap so that the loose jaw will be at the far end from the bait. [Illustration: SOME CANADIAN REDS.] It is a good thing to place some clean white cotton wool under the pan with a few drops of the scent. As soon as a fox is caught save a front leg and with it print some signs such as a live fox would do, all over the place where the trap is set; also save the urine from the bladder of the fox and when it becomes rancid, sprinkle a few drops on the weeds near the trap and the first fox that will come will be yours. To poison them strychnine is required. First, use fresh beef suet and make pills the size of a big pea. Second, put the size of a large grain of wheat of strychnine and stick these pills in your bait the same way as garlic in a roast. Third, take a fresh cow head, stick your pills in the fleshy parts of the head, but do not place them too close to each other, then hang the head out of the reach of the hens, etc., in a stable where there is cattle for one night, then take it to the place you wish to leave it and there throw away like a lost head. A good way to place such bait is on a good sized lake. Place the head in the center of it and you will find your fox every time. Of course when you are using poison you must visit your bait every morning at daylight, so that the drifting snow, etc., will not cover the fox's tracks. While visiting the bait, keep to one side and from three to five feet from it; don't monkey around it, and if Mr. Fox came to the bait and if you have reason to think he has taken a pill, make a circuit of a 100 yards or more until you come to the trail of a fox going away from the bait. As soon as a fox feels the effect of the poison he will make several long jumps and then start to walk. Follow his tracks, and the moment you notice zigzags in the tracks, or that the fox is looking for an easy place to go through a fence, etc., this is a sure sign that the fox is sick, and you can follow that track and find the fox. Sometimes you will find them not 50 yards from the bait, and other times a half or three-quarters of a mile from the bait. This depends upon the time spent at the bait and is also due to other causes. A good way to poison them is to place a pill in a mouse or a small piece of liver, but I prefer to make pills with lard, about a square inch, and I insert the poison in the middle of the bullet. To do this, I bore a small hole with a stick, and then place the strychnine and cover the hole with the lard taken from it. To do this with ease, the lard must be partly frozen, smear with honey and keep frozen; then take some frozen liver (any kind will do) and chop it in fine pieces and mix with honey and keep in a small wood box. Smoke the box the same as the traps and smear inside with honey and add a few drops of the medicine. The kind of box I recommend is one 4""x12"" made of either cedar or bass wood 1/4 inch thick, with two compartments, one 4""x8"" for the liver pieces and the other 4""x4"" for the bullets, with a sliding door at each end, and a piece of leather held by small screws on the top for the hand. When ready, take your ammunition and once on fox land, smear your snow shoes with the scent and at every hundred yards drop a few bits of liver, and at every 500 yards or so, a few more with a pill, and in the pill stick a four inch black feather, and two feet to the right stick a strong weed, and in such a way that the wind will not throw it down. This will enable you to find the pill in case of a snow storm, and by brushing the snow lightly with your mit, the pill can be found at once, unless a fox took it. If the bullet has not been touched you can tell without having to remove the snow, as the feather will stand straight up, and this is a sure sign that the poison is still there. If no feather can be seen and if it has been stormy, brush the snow away, the lard is not as white as the snow and is easily found. Should it be gone, look carefully around the place; sometimes you will see the feather 10 or 20 feet from the place you have placed the pill, and there or elsewhere you should see a place where the fox has been digging a hole. Examine the hole carefully and you may find the poison, as often when not hungry he will hide it for some other time, or for his friend. If you have reason to believe that a fox took the pill, and owing to stormy weather you cannot find him, you must survey the grounds as soon as the snow commences to melt, and by looking carefully along the fences you will often find them. Always keep trace of your pills; the best places to put these is in the middle of a lake or field; the black feather will attract the attention of the foxes at once, and they will make immediately for any black spots they see in a field or on a lake. To shoot them in winter: Get a complete suit made of white cotton, including cap, smear your suit with scent, or have some balls of cotton wool smeared with it and tie these around your belt with a good string in such a way that you can remove them at will. In a fine moonlight, take your snow shoes and go where the foxes are traveling, and the moment you see one or hear one bark, circle around him so that the wind will carry the scent. He will come towards you and will stop at a certain distance from you, and as you notice him on the alert, stop moving. The fox will put his head up and will look in all directions in order to locate where the nest of the plump mice are, and as you notice this sound the squeal of the field mouse; the fox will at once run toward you; then shoot him. I use BB shot for foxes. Where foxes are plentiful, a hunter of some experience can bag several in three or four hours. I have killed as many as four in three hours. A good wind, fine moonlight, and lots of foxes, a fellow will have fine sport. In shooting foxes, keep as much as possible on the small hills so as to survey more land. While I was living in the country I had good sport shooting them in the spring, in the high snow banks along the fences. Foxes are fond of playing at such places, especially when there is a crust to carry them. This generally comes in Canada at the latter end of February and during the month of March. I have often killed them at bait. Horse meat is fine bait for them. I once killed two big foxes at one shot. A hunter can always approach a fox when he is feeding, providing he knows how. When I trap fox I do it on a large scale. I always set a combination of traps and snares. I carry a good supply of wire snares. The twine must be of dark color. In making a trail for fox, I take advantage of every good place I find either for trap or snares, either between bunches of weeds, trees, stones, stumps, roots, logs, fences, etc., where Mr. Fox will have to pass to follow my trail. On the rail or other board fences I use the twine snare, and on a barbed wire fence, the wire snare. In setting a twine snare, I always use a drop log or stone, and so fixed that as soon as the fox pulls the weight drops, and he is lifted and hung at once. I use ordinary wire fence staples and two to each set, one placed so that when the weight falls the neck of the fox is carried close to the staple and held there, and the other staple close to the drop. The drop must be placed so that it cannot reach the ground, and must weigh about three times as much as any fox. Any fox that puts his head in the loop is sure to stay there. In the bush, I take advantage of all shanty roads, and I use spring poles when I find a suitable tree. I just trim the head and use a wire snare so that the squirrels, etc., will not bother it. I set traps at the baits and in the middle of the fields in the same way as poison, with bits of liver around it, and I cover the trap with a light coat of snow with the same little shovel, and under the pan I place some cotton wool with a few drops of scent, and should, while the fox is picking up the pieces of liver, not step on the trap, he is sure to scratch for the mouse under the pan, and the trap will mouse him. CHAPTER XII. MY FIRST FOX. I presume that almost every boy trapper in North America has an ardent wish to trap one of these cunning sharp witted animals, and I remember I thought when a boy if I could only catch a fox in a trap my reputation as a trapper would be made, says F. W. Howard, of Wisconsin. Boys, you must not be discouraged if, after following the methods you hear, you fail to take a fox, for probably most of you have only traps enough to make one set; any of us older trappers I think will admit that it is rather a difficult feat to make one set and take a fox in a reasonably short time. Most of the trappers who use these sets have likely from a dozen to fifty traps out for fox at one time. I have sometimes taken foxes in traps set for skunk, coon and mink, so that one may say that with a large number of traps out, even though not set with the care and precautions usually taken to catch a fox, the large number of chances open enable one to take here and there a blundering and unwary fellow. I trapped my first fox when about twelve years old, by following a method given me by my grandfather, who was, in his day, a famous New England fox hunter. He was a very old man at that time, but when I expressed to him my heart's desire, asking him how and where to set the trap (I had but one suitable for fox) he told me to get my father to let me take the oxen and plow, to make a couple of furrows in our back pasture. Following his instructions I boiled the trap in weak lye and then daubed it over with fresh cow manure. The back pasture spoken of was a place where foxes traveled, and I presume that there was no week in the year that at least two or three foxes did not cross there. [Illustration: CAUGHT IN A NO 1.] Now, this is a very important point, if you are making but one set especially, be sure and find a location for the set near some den or ledge where foxes live, or at some point where you know they are in the habit of crossing. But to continue, under my aged instructor's direction I plowed two furrows across the pasture in the form of an X. ""Now,"" said he, ""any fox that comes along will get down and run in the furrows. Set your traps where they cross, and I shouldn't wonder if you found one up here some fine morning."" I scooped out a shallow hole of a size to hold the trap and clog, put a bunch of wool under the pan so it would spring easily, and covered all slightly and smoothly with dirt; Granddad then placed some lumps of dirt in such a way that a fox would be apt to step over them into the trap, if coming from any direction. He cautioned me in visiting the trap to walk by it some distance away. ""How long do you think it will be before we catch a fox?"", I asked. ""Maybe not for a week, and maybe not at all, but I tell you boy, if you want to catch a fox you have got to stick to it."" You can imagine my delight the next morning on finding a fine red fox tangled up among some huckleberry bushes near by, and you may be sure I thought Granddad the greatest trapper in the world, and myself the next. I caught two more foxes at the same set before snow came, and will say that I have always found this method one of the surest, but of course very few boys are situated so as to have pastures that foxes cross, and which they can plow furrows in. Foxes are generally suspicious of a dead bait; however, at a bait which they have been in the habit of visiting, generally some carcass, they are more easily caught than at a freshly placed bait or carcass, and it is a good plan, if you try taking a fox in this way, to put out the carcass or large baits long enough in advance for them to get into the practice of coming to them; then place your traps, if possible, just before a fall of snow, and you are almost certain of catching one. The traps should always be set with care and treated as already described, to cover the scent of iron, as a fox considers the scent of man and iron a dangerous combination, and they undoubtedly know about traps and fear them. [Illustration: CAUGHT ON HIS OWN FARM.] I like to use a live bait for fox and bobcats, and a rabbit is about the best for this purpose, because they are easily secured. They form the principal game of these animals and they are nearly always looking for them. It is, I think, safe to say, that each grown fox or bobcat kill two hundred each on an average every year. The sight or hot scent of any game these animals are accustomed to hunt excites them, and their faculties are at once concentrated on how to capture and get on the outside of said game as soon as possible. Under such conditions, they fall more easy prey to trappers' wiles. Select a point where you know foxes hunt, or not far from some den or ledge which they use. Find a hollow log or some tree that has a hollow butt with an opening; in either case, plug the hollow securely so the rabbit will have to stay up near the opening, put in some carrots, or ears of corn, and cover the hole with woven wire, having about an inch mesh, or some barb wire stapled across will sometimes answer; they may in some cases be afraid of the wire, but I have had excellent success with this method, and my opinion is that the sight of live game makes them reckless (on one occasion I caught a fox in a wooden box about eight inches square and three or four feet long, having a wire door, hinged at the top and slanting in,--a self-setter--the trap had a live rabbit inside and was set along a creek, for the purpose of taking a mink alive and uninjured). If this method is used as a snow set, brush out all tracks, and whether on snow or bare ground, always make as few tracks and leave as little sign as possible around your traps. When setting for any shy animal, don't cover or handle trap or clog with bare hands. Use gloves and a small wooden spade. CHAPTER XIII. TENNESSEE TRAPPER'S METHODS. Do you trap foxes? If you do I bet you have some favorite way, and too, doubtless in most respects it's different from my way of trapping them, as there seems to be almost as many methods as there are successful trappers; nor either is the same confined to the methods used, but to the kind of traps employed, baits, scents, etc., says B. P. Pickens. The Water Set, the Sheep Path Methods, are national, and known to be O. K., though the former requires bait attractions, and lots of other preparations, while the latter with me has never necessarily required baits or scents to make it a good success. I do not confine my fox trapping to any one method long, for I am always governed by the surroundings, and conditions, yet my traps are set and concealed the same way, no matter for what animals I intend to trap. My traps set for skunk and rats are just as carefully set and concealed as though they were set for fox and coon. My favorite is a Newhouse Fox Trap for every purpose, as it will hold. My reasons for using nothing smaller than a No. 2 Fox Trap is that a fellow does not always know if a fox will happen about his skunk traps or a big coon about his rat traps, and since I have found Mr. Fox and Mr. Coon a few times in the toils I make every preparation for his reception. I will endeavor to tell some of the things I do, which is a good way to take a fox. I commence early in the spring, if the ground is not ready to arrange for my fall and winter trapping, looking out for their signs, and continue to keep my eyes open all summer and around the pastures, in the fields, old roads, and in the woods, gullies and washouts. I arrange to trap them in stock paths by laying a limb or fence rail across these paths, while the use of stock all summer renders it old, and on either side of this path obstruction is just the place for a fox trap. I cut and wire my trap chain to the middle of a brush, one that a fox can drag some distance away, which leaves this same place a good risk for another catch, where if stapled to something he could not move he would render the place unfit for the rest of the season. Conceal your trap by digging a hole on either side of the path obstruction the size of the trap to be used, setting trap always springs with path, have the hole deep enough so when the trap is well covered with leaves, then on the leaves a layer of dirt, it will just be level with the earth and look natural. To use this same underground method in cold freezing weather, first bed the trap hole good with dry leaves, or grass, over springs and all, being sure to use dry flat leaves to lay over the pan and jaws, then cover over all with some of the remaining dirt before mentioned. Be sure to hide chain and handle everything with gloves. Now brush out your tracks, step over your trap and go on. One way of trapping foxes may be done like this. Around the pastures and in the woods where stock make paths lay a fence rail, or its equivalent across these paths, and the use of stock during the summer months will render these prearranged obstructions worn and natural by November trapping, and on either side of such an obstruction is a splendid place to set your trap for the fox to step in, writes L. M. Pickens. Paths, places under fences, little washouts, and old roads not much used are generally his favorite travels. See after his tracks in the dust, mud, or snow; notice how he steps over one of these obstructions that you arranged early in the summer, and other places, studying him, then set your trap this way, using every precaution to not change any of the surroundings. [Illustration: TENNESSEE TRAPPERS AND TRAPS.] Carry with you a little hard wood stick, ready sharpened, with which to dig a hole on either side of this obstruction that has been lying over the stock path just the size of your trap, and deep enough so your trap pan and jaws will be a little below the level of the surface. Now cover over springs good and all around the outside of jaws with some of this dirt you dug up; now you have the trap concealed all but its pan and inside of jaws; finish the set by laying some small flat leaves from jaws to pan, commencing and going all the way around jaws; after this is done pulverize some of the remaining dirt, and sprinkle it over these leaves, entirely covering them. Take a small twig and level over trap, finishing the job. It might help some to cut a part of a bird into fine pieces, dropping it and loose feathers over this kind of a set. To fasten the trap is some of the job. Cut a bush with a lot of limbs to it, and wire your trap to the middle of same securely, but do not have the brush drag so heavily that he cannot run off with it; it is intended for him to go immediately after he is caught, for these reasons, he will soon hang up some distance away, and thus fastened, he is not stationed at this good place where another may be caught, besides his chances of pulling out of the trap is less than it is if he was stapled to something he could not move. The brush is a give and take game, see? Be sure to cover chain of trap good, and have everything look as natural when you leave us when you came to set trap. Use No. 2 Newhouse, handling it and everything with gloves; always stand In one place; leave no paper or whittlings on the premises. I use this method just outlined. Try it boys. CHAPTER XIV. MANY GOOD METHODS. There is no animal roaming the woods so hard to catch in a steel trap as the fox, says a writer in the _Orange Judd Farmer_. Yet when one understands his nature he is easily taken despite his cunning. The following method I have employed successfully: First take four good steel traps and cover them with fresh blood at a slaughter house. Take a dead hen (one that has died a natural death will do if there is no odor), and run a wire up in her head and down in her body; also wires through her feet and legs. Select a place where foxes run near a low bush or small tree. On a branch of this, about three feet from the ground, fasten your hen solidly with the wires in her feet. By means of wire in her neck, bend it so she will look as if she were on a roost. Be very particular on this point. Set your trap a little below the surface of the soil, so that the tops are level. Now cover up with leaves and grass so that there is no difference in appearance from the surrounding ground. Be sure the chains are well staked. Mr. Fox comes up and sees the hen. He squats down on his stomach. He will lie there for five minutes watching the hen. Then he makes a spring for her neck, and gets it, but the traps get him and the boy gets the fox if he is cute enough. * * * Well here is how I caught my first fox, says C. F. Hotchkiss, of Wisconsin. It was in the winter of 1887 and 1888. I was working for a farmer here in Shawano Co., had to drive the stock to the river to water all winter. I noticed fox tracks on the ice so I bought a double spring Newhouse. Gave 60 cents for it, took some chaff from the hay in the cow stable for a bed and set the trap on the river bank under a large hemlock to protect it from storms, covered trap with chaff and strewed pieces of chicken and feathers on the bed. In four days I had two foxes, then some one stole my trap and I did not try any more then. Last winter I was working for the same farmer again. He lost two sheep. We drew the carcasses out in the woods, set four traps at one sheep and six at the other. In seven weeks we had 14 foxes and we lost no time from other work. We pulled wool from the sheep to cover the traps with. I do not think it best to spit near a fox trap, especially tobacco spit. There may be some foxes that do not care for it, but I know they are not all built that way. One of my methods of trapping Reynard was as follows: First, thoroughly besmear the trap with droppings from cattle, using no other preparation, neither boiling or smoking, as some recommend to prevent their fear of human scent, then my favorite sets being in the path of some old timber or wood road or cattle path in some unusual pasture. After selecting the place best suited, according to my best judgment, take a knife to cut out a hole corresponding to size of trap, remove carefully all loose earth. I usually carried a small basket for the reception of everything taken up this way. Set the trap carefully, covering loosely with some coarse material and topping the whole with material to correspond with the surrounding surface of paths, and lastly laying a small twig across just at one side of where the trap is set, as a fox will always step over any small obstruction, and by placing the twig in this manner he would step over into the trap. [Illustration: THIRTY SILVER FOX SKINS WORTH $5000.] In the section of country which I am now writing, that just east of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, there were innumerable such roads and paths, so that I had all the territory I desired for the purpose. Have caught many a sly chap in this manner. Had a good grapple at end of chain and never fastened a trap but let them make a few jumps when they would nearly always get caught up, yet on a few occasions have had to put up a pretty stiff hunt before locating them. For instance, there might be a snow storm, if late in the season, or a heavy rain. In this case there might not be any signs to go by, and I would have to go on a blind hunt and cover considerable ground before I could skin my fox. * * * I had my traps all set one fall and everything was coming my way, until one morning I found that I was dealing with a fox that knew as much about trapping as I did. I had my trap set in a spring and every time he wanted to steal bait he could manage it without getting into the trap. I let the trap set the same way and kept it baited but meanwhile I was thinking of a plan to capture him. In fixing the spring I made a dam out of dirt, placing a few small flat stones on top of it. Now I made up my mind that as the dam was the nearest point to the bait that he must be stealing it from that place. Now I took the trap out of the spring and put in a stone covered with a tuft of grass to resemble the trap and setting the trap itself in the dam, covering with dirt and laying a little flat stone on the pan. I had made up my mind that when he stepped on the dam he would step on the small stones that I had laid on top to keep the dirt from washing away. While stepping on the dam to reach for the bait he stepped on the small stone on the pan and was held fast by a No. 2 1/2 Blake & Lamb trap, just as I had calculated on. * * * One way of trapping fox is setting under water, especially in slow moving water, is most effectual in killing the trap odor, says a Michigan trapper. The metallic smell will not rise through water, but will be absorbed and carried away by it. As much as a fortnight before setting take a hoe and dig a shallow pool in a swamp where foxes are known to cross. Dig it six or seven feet across in a mucky ooze and leave a drain way or outlet open so that in event of rain storms, water will not rise and stand too deep in the pool. The pool should bear as few evidences as possible of having been made by man. In the course of a fortnight after the scent of the trapper has faded away and leaves have fallen, the trap is smeared with tallow and the chain is fastened to long narrow stone, approaching so as to make and leave as few tracks as possible. The trap along with the stone and chain is set in the bottom of the pool, not in the center, but so near one side that the trap will be from 12 to 14 inches from the low bank. A little tuft of grass as large as a soda biscuit is placed directly over the trap resting on it, so the top of the tuft will show a little above the water, looking as though it grew there. About a foot beyond it further out in the water another tuft a little larger and thicker, is placed so it will show distinctly above the water, and on it place the bait. A fox crossing the swamp on a chilly day scenting the bait will approach the pool. To avoid wading in the cold muddy water he will probably step on the nearest tuft. That is the one on the trap in which he will be caught by the foreleg. * * * I will tell you what I know about the fox, says a Canadian trapper. He is the slyest animal we have to deal with here. I think the best way is to use several different ways to trap foxes, and your chances will be doubled in taking them. Take a horse or beef head and put it out in the woods and leave it there for about a week. Then if the foxes have been at it, set your traps and cover with leaves or dead pine needles. When you are leaving take a brush and brush some snow over your traps to about half cover the leaves. Leave no foot marks around and you will be pretty sure to get your fox. Another good way is to take tainted beef or pig kidneys and put them at the back of a V, made by two logs falling across each other. I took one this way before the snow came, but he got away with my trap. I have read and heard a lot about human scent and animals being afraid of it. I have seen enough to be sure that fox are not afraid of either human scent or steel traps, if the dirt is not disturbed around the trap. * * * [Illustration: CALIFORNIA TRAPPER VISITING TRAPS.] When snow is plentiful so that sly Reynard may be tracked, then search out his haunts and find where he sleeps in the day time, says a Canadian hunter. They seldom go in holes in the winter, and in the bright sunny days are very sleepy. In tracking you will see marks where they have been lying, generally in some elevated position close to their haunts, where they may be caught napping as they often are caught. The snow should be soft so as to make the least noise possible, but it is astonishing the amount of noise you can make and still not disturb them, providing you have been thoughtful enough to keep the wind in your favor, as they are very quick to smell a person, so in consequence you should always face the wind and go easy in your search. The snow shoes are a great help when the snow is deep, as it is then that the fox is easiest gotten as they will not go far in the deep snow. Try it boys and be surprised at your success. * * * I will try and explain to you my method of catching fox alive, writes Howard Hurst, of Pennsylvania. Take a common box trap, put a wire partition about 4 inches from back end of trap. On the back end of trap put a wire door that you can open and shut. Take the trap to some good den, take a small live chicken and put in the back part of trap. The noise of the chicken will attract the foxes' attention and he will enter the trap door. I saw four caught this way last spring by a boy 9 years old. * * * I will mention how you can get a fox without bait, says Jarvis Green, of Maine. Look up an old path or wood road where you see that they have traveled, and notice a mound or rise of ground; now the foxes always stop to urinate on all such places. When you see the wind and atmosphere indicates a fall of snow, go and set your trap, smear with balsam of fir, cedar, hemlock or spruce, set your trap on center of mound and on one side stick up a tree branch to look as if grown there, about eight inches high, fasten trap to a clog by the middle, cover trap lightly with some fine substance. A drop or two of scent is sure of every one that comes along. Try this. The Blake & Lamb trap is best. I have only one fault with the single spring and that is the trencher is too large. On the new style if the animal steps on the edge of trencher, result is a toe or two will be left. Be careful in covering trap so that when it springs the jaws will shut tight. * * * [Illustration: PENNSYLVANIA FOX TRAPPER'S CABIN.] When I was a boy I used to hunt foxes with dog and gun. In tracking them I noticed that they would go to every skunk that was killed, writes L. M. Cartwright, of Pennsylvania, near where they traveled, and nose around, but never saw where they ate any of it, so I used the scent successfully in catching them. I have caught many of them in No. 1 Newhouse trap fastened to a clog; had one to pull the staple out of a clog and carry trap as much as five miles before catching him, and if it had not been for a fresh fall of snow would have been out. About as sure a way to catch fox (if you have the proper place) is to snare him. Here they very often cross the creek on logs or trees that have fallen across, when the creek is not frozen over. Take about three and a half feet of wire, such as is used for baling hay, make a snare, staple or spike the end of wire down on the side of the tree about the center of the creek, bend wire up so the loop comes over the center of log, make loop about seven or eight inches in diameter, set small bush on each side, stick in log and cover just over top of snare. If properly set will catch fox, coon and dogs (so it is best to set where dogs do not travel). I suppose any log up from the ground high enough would do by using the scent from the female fox. Another way, drive a stake beside a log, set trap about six to nine inches away, pour fish brine on stake and see what it will do. This should be away from dogs. My way of trapping the fox is by the old method. Take a bushel of buckwheat chaff and where foxes travel nearly every night scatter it about four feet around, and take a stick and pat the chaff down so it is nice and smooth all over the bed. Then take tallow cracklings and scatter them over the bed about a foot apart, then leave everything natural, and as soon as a fox takes the bait place your trap (which should be a double spring Newhouse or a No. 2 1/2 B. & L.) set it in center of bed and cover about 3/4 or 1 inch with chaff. Put cotton under pan so it will not hinder trap from springing. The trap should be fastened to a clog or drag hook. I say to young trappers try my way and you will be successful. * * * Do not spit or drop anything or touch anything with your bare hands, says a Vermont trapper. Yes, I know some say animals are not afraid of human scent. I have my ideas and know what I have to do to be successful. If others can make a success in a different way I will not disagree with them. You cut a stake, sharpen it at one end, cut it about 15 inches long, about 1 inch in diameter; leave a prong about three inches long and about three inches from top to stake down trap. I will set this No. 2 1/2 Blake now. I ask all of you to pay attention, as I have often made the assertion that I could set a fox trap before 400 persons and not ten of them would make fox trappers. Now let me set this trap and carry it set to this bank, which is a sharp knoll about two feet high. I take my digger and cut a sod 6 inches square. Now I dig a hole back in the bank 6 or 8 inches and about three inches across. Make the cavity large enough to set trap about 3 inches deep, place ring over stake and drive stake in ground under where you set the trap. Set trap so pan will be about three inches from mouth of hole and square in front of hole. Now with digger cover trap about 1/2 inch deep so it will be all covered evenly. Put two pieces of bait in hole beyond trap and about three inches from mouth, and one in further end of hole. Drop a few drops of scent at mouth of hole and the thing is done. If you have paid attention you will see that I have touched nothing with my hands and never stepped out of my tracks setting trap. * * * The fox is, without doubt, the most cunning of all cunning animals we trappers have to trap, says an Eastern trapper. Many times have I been to my fox traps to find one or so turned bottom side up and no fox. A fox will reach into a bed and take your bait with his paw, and I have trapped them when actions said plain as words, ""you can't fool me."" I find the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse a very good trap for the fox, especially in early fall when the ground don't freeze. A fox will start on his nightly rounds and frequent small clearings in woods, sandy side hills and such places, and that is the place a trapper wants a few tanglefoot. I have trapped fox for quite a number of years, and I never caught one by accident yet. I always have to set for fox and fox only. In regard to poisoning, I think that a man that uses it ought to be shot full of holes. In regard to iron smell, I will say that fox can smell iron, but bury your trap deep enough and you will be all right. A good scent is as follows: Take skunk essence, white of eggs, and let stand about one week. Use about five drops and I will warrant it to be the best fox scent made. * * * We all know it's difficult to catch the fox on dry land, although it is done, says a New England trapper. There are thousands of fox who fall victims to this way, and I believe it a more successful method than any in existence. I shall recommend a spring to set your trap in because the water does not rise or fall much, like a brook. Carefully dig out your spring in July or August, arranging it so that you will have it ready by fall, by placing a flat stone about fifteen inches from the stone so it will project above water about one inch; on top of this place a sod about three inches thick if possible, and have the edges come into the water so it will look natural. Cut your sods that you are to fix inside the trap, and lay up to dry when you prepare your place. When the time is ready for setting your trap, go to the place by walking up the outlet of the spring or brook, using the greatest care, and not touch the brushes or anything around the trap; place your trap very near the edge of the spring, about six or eight inches from the sod; have the trap entirely under water, and place your sod, cut for the purpose, on the pan, have it cover all the space inside the trap, and be sure it is out of water enough to offer a dry footing for the fox, and not over two inches from the shore. Some have the shore cut out so half the trap is on apparently dry land. Either way is all right. Place your bait on the side of the sod, using scent and being sure that your bait or scent cannot be reached except by the fox stepping on the pan of the trap, and you will get your fox. When you visit your trap do not go too near, as all these things have their effect. I should recommend for bait cat or muskrat, a piece half the size of an egg is all right. It should be prepared by placing in a perfectly clean jar the number of bait you wish, and allow to taint, putting the scent in with the bait, or dropping on the bait after you place on sod. You must use the greatest care in handling your bait. Do not take out or place on the bait with your bare hands. Use a stick. [Illustration: NEW ENGLAND TRAPPERS CATCH.] I have been waiting for some of the fox trappers of the Red River Valley, says a Minnesota trapper, to write and tell us how they manage to pinch Mr. Reynard's toes. I think we have a harder place here to trap fox than you Eastern fellows have. The country is just as level as a board and no timber, and we are liable to have a blizzard any hour. What makes it hard to trap is that the traps always blow in if you haven't got them in a good place. I have quite a trick to catch the fox, at least I have had the best luck with it. I first find a place where an old straw pile was burned, then smear my traps with blood and hide them good in ashes, erase all of my tracks and drop a few spirits of anise oil all around. For bait I generally use the entrails of a hog or beef. Last winter I caught two without any bait; just the oil. Last winter I had good luck with dead chickens. I always staple my traps to a clog of about twelve or fifteen pounds weight. On this clog I nailed the chicken and I got every fox that came around. I only trapped one month with two traps, No. 2 Newhouse, and I got 6 fox and 1 wolf, and that was all the fox there were inside of about three or four miles, and I didn't have time to go further because I am a farmer and have my stock to tend. * * * If you know where there is a meadow with hay or straw stacked out on it, says Austin Palin, of Indiana, and if you will go to this stack after a little snow and there has been a fox in the field, he will be pretty sure to have gone to the stack to nose around. I first go and catch some fish about 6 or 8 inches long. I generally get suckers. I now clean my traps by boiling them in weak lye, then reboil them in evergreen boughs. I think it advisable to run beeswax over your trap, but I have had success without the beeswax. After you have your traps cleaned and fixed do not handle them with your bare hands but put on a pair of gloves, take your trap and fish and a piece of wood about 4 feet long and the thickness of your arm and go to the stack. Now raise up the edge of the hay at the ground and slip the fish (one will be enough) back under the hay 6 or 8 inches, then set your trap directly in front of it, covering with the fine chaff; now fasten the trap chain to the piece of wood and slip the stick back under the stack, working it around a little so when the fox gets fast he can pull it out easily. Now take a stick and straighten out the hay over the trap and scratch out all signs and your set is complete. Make the above set when there is no snow. * * * We trapped foxes by baiting in beds mostly, says a Michigan trapper, though we caught five in the following manner: A wounded deer had fallen near two down trees which lap with tops crossed. We drew the deer into the apex or pen, as we noticed that foxes had been visiting the carcass. We cut notches out of these trees which were old and moss-covered, and set traps in the places prepared, covering neatly with moss. Foxes are prone to walk convenient logs investigating anything that attracts them, and rarely look for danger under foot if the trap has been well placed and cleverly hidden. We smoked our traps and handled them with mittens. * * * The red fox is the only species that abounds in this locality, says Wm. Muchon, of Minnesota. When run by the hounds he usually keeps half a mile ahead, regulating his speed by that of the hounds, occasionally pausing a moment to divert himself with a mouse or to contemplate the landscape or to listen for his pursuer. A most spirited and exciting chase occurs when the dogs gets close upon one in the open field. The fox relies so confidently upon his superior speed that I imagine he half tempts the dog to the race, but if he be a smart dog, and their course lies down hill over smooth ground, Reynard must put his best foot forward and then sometimes suffers the ignominy of being run over by his pursuer, who, however, is quite unable to pick him up, owing to the speed. But uphill and in the woods the superior nimbleness and agility of the fox tells at once. Carry the carcass of a pig or a fowl to a distant field in mid-winter, and in a few nights his tracks cover the snow about it. The inexperienced youth, misled by this seeming carelessness of Reynard, suddenly conceives a project to enrich himself with fur, and wonders why the idea has not occurred to him before and to others. I knew a youthful yeoman of this kind who imagined he had found a mine of wealth discovering on a remote side hill between two woods a dead porker, upon which it appeared all the foxes of the neighborhood did nightly banquet. The clouds were burdened with snow and as the first flakes began to eddy down he set out, trap and broom in hand, already counting over in imagination the silver quarters he would receive for the first fox skin. With the utmost care and with a palpitating heart he removed enough of the trodden snow to allow the trap to sink below the surface. The next morning at dawn he was on his way to bring his fur. The snow had done its work effectually, and he believed had kept his secret well. Approaching nearer, the surface was unbroken, and doubt usurped the place of certainty in his mind. A slight wound marked the side of the porker, but there was no footprint near it. Looking up the hill, he saw where Reynard had walked leisurely down toward his wanted bacon till within a few yards when he had wheeled, and with prodigious strides disappeared in the woods. The stream of silver quarters suddenly set in another direction. The successful trapper commences in the fall, or before the first deep snow. In a field not too remote with an old axe he cuts a small place, say ten inches by fourteen in the frozen ground, and removes the earth to the depth of three or four inches, then fills the cavity with dry ashes in which are placed bits of roasted cheese. Reynard is very suspicious and gives the place a wide berth, but the cheese is savory and the cold severe. He ventures a little closer every night until he can reach and pick out a piece from the ashes, and finding a fresh supply of the delectable morsels every night is soon thrown off his guard and his suspicions lulled. After a week of baiting in this way, the trapper carefully conceals his trap in the bed, first smoking it thoroughly with hemlock boughs so as to kill all smell of iron. If the weather favors, and the proper precautions have been taken he may succeed, though the chances are still greatly against him. * * * I will say that we keep four of the best fox traps in the shape of four hounds that can be found in our part of the country, writes J. A. McKinnon, of Canada, and as for the month of November we sold $85.00 worth of fur, it will be easily seen that they pay for their keep. The fox hound, like the coon dog, must be a good one, properly bred and trained for the purpose, and they are never first class until they are two or three years old, although I have killed foxes ahead of dogs that were only nine months old, but these turned out to be exceptionally good dogs, and out of a litter of six or eight puppies half of the number may be worthless for what I call a good fox hound is one that will hunt for his fox alone, and that will run all day if necessary. I went out on the first snow and in one day captured three foxes, two of which I shot, and the other ran into a hollow log; he was running so hard I believe he would have got into the rail if there had been no hole at all. I also find that the morning is the best time to find a fresh track, as it is then that Reynard is up and taking his morning walk through the old barren meadows, and partly cleared fields, in search of mice and other small game. In my experience I find that the females do not move around so much in the day time as the males do, for they are shyer than the males and are possessed of more cunningness. In our travels we always mark any fox dens we come across, so as to pay them a friendly call after a fresh fall of snow. We use the Winchester repeating shot guns, and find that for long range and quick shooting they are the best. We sometimes use our rifles but a fox is a small mark to shot at if he is running at full speed. Brother trappers, get a pair of good fox hounds and you will get more foxes than with all the traps you could set in a week. * * * I don't think there are many men now living that have skinned many more fox than I have, yet I can learn every year something new about Reynard, says O. Douglass, of Michigan. But what I do want to know is this: I see so much about water sets, and I don't understand how it can be done only for the fun of it. I have bought for many years, and I have as yet to see many prime water trapped fox. They are caught too early to be prime, and I can't see where the money comes in to pay for your trouble. Now trappers, don't you think it is better to make some fine dry land sets in July or August and bait them once a week until they are prime, and you have them coming to your beds and they are not afraid of your work? I say this to young trappers. I have been trying all ways for sixty years and have caught them many different ways, but I do think the water set is the poorest way of all. Dry land sets for me every time in November and December. I make my beds early and I use the scrap from hog's lard. I take one skunk scent bag to each bed to draw them to the bait, and when they come once they will call again. I see where a buyer was called to buy 14 fox hides and only found one prime skin. All water caught. That is my experience with water caught fox. They have to be caught too early. It may be different in some localities, but not here, as the water is frozen by the time fox are prime. Try dry land sets and see if I am not right, and have more money for your work later on. I always set two traps to one bed, and cover with dry dirt until it freezes. Then I use chaff. Handle all with clean gloves and be as cunning as a fox yourself. [Illustration: PACK OF NEW ENGLAND FOX HOUNDS.] CHAPTER XV. FRED AND THE OLD TRAPPER. Young trappers can learn much by making the rounds with experienced trappers. The following conversation between Fred and an old Pennsylvania trapper is interesting: ""Where was the trap set? I do not see any bait pen."" ""Fred, you take this stick and walk up slowly to him; go up close and give him a sharp blow across the back of the neck. That will fix him. You see that big mossy log laying on the bank over there. That was where he was caught. We will now set the trap again. See this little sink in the log. That is where the trap was set. This limb is what the trap was fastened to, one end on the ground and the other comes just up to the log where the trap is set, and we will staple the trap to it. We will now cover it with moss just like this on this log, but we will get it from another log. No one could tell that there was a trap there."" ""Will not the fox smell it?"" ""He might if it was not for this fox carcass. We will skin the fox. Look out there, Fred, do not disturb the moss or anything on that log where the trap is. Keep away from that. We will put this carcass in the little hollow and will drive a crotched stake straddle of its neck; drive it well down; now take this stick and rake some leaves over it, cover the neck where the stake is quite well, the rest of the carcass only lightly. You have done it very well and the fox will not notice what scent there is on the trap as long as that carcass is there."" ""But you had no carcass there when you caught this one, and I have heard that a fox was afraid of the scent of iron."" ""That is all bosh! Keep the traps free from all foreign scent and you need not be afraid of the scent of the iron, but if you catch some animal in the trap then you must have some of the scent of that animal around near the trap. This will overcome what scent there is on the trap. This, however, is only necessary with shy animals like the fox. Coon and skunk are not afraid of what they smell. ""How did you know that a fox would go on that log where that trap was set?"" ""By knowing the nature of the animal. When the fox smelt the bear bait in the pen there we knew that he would get on the highest point near the pen to investigate, and that point was that log."" ""Is this the only way you catch foxes?"" ""No, this is only one of the many ways."" CHAPTER XVI. EXPERIENCED TRAPPER'S TRICKS. The fox is the most cunning animal we have, consequently he is the most difficult one to trap, says C. E. Matheny, of Ohio. But like all other animals he has a weak point, and if you attack him at this point he will, without a doubt, fall into your snares. One of the most important things when about to trap a fox is to have the trap perfectly clean. The word clean, in this sense, does not allude to freedom from rust, but means that the trap should be entirely free from human scent. In order to avoid this, the trap must be thoroughly washed in lye and when dry, well greased and smoked over burning feathers. It has already been said that the fox has a very keen scent, but it is particularly shy and scary at the least odor of the human body. It is therefore necessary when handling the trap to use clean buckskin, or still better, rubber gloves, and unless this important precaution is observed success is very improbable. The next step is to make the bed for the trap, and although there are various ways of doing this, the following, I believe, is the best method. The bed should be about three and a half feet in diameter, and made of wheat, hay or buckwheat chaff. Some trappers use wood ashes, but any of the above will be found better. The ground upon which the bed is made should be hollowed out in the center so as to admit the trap, and the bed should be made as hard as possible and deep enough to cover the trap, and at the same time be perfectly level with the ground. When the bed is made as directed, take the trap (which should be a No. 2 and have a chain and clog attached to it) and place it in the hollow in the center of the bed. After setting the trap put some of the chaff inside the jaws as high as the pan. Cover the pan with paper so that the chaff will not prevent its working freely, and then cover the whole with chaff and level it off so that the fox will not suspect a trap to be there; finally bait it with fresh meat, cheese, or better still, cracklings after lard is pressed out. Scatter them liberally over the bed; do not tramp about the bed more than is absolutely necessary, and cover up all foot-tracks as much as possible. It is a good plan to smear the trap with assafoetida or melted beeswax, with a few drops of the oil of rhodium. These are all good and may be employed for the purpose of deceiving a particularly cunning fellow after all other stratagems fail. Another good plan is to bait the bed several times before setting the trap, until the fox begins to think that this is the best place it ever knew to find a choice morsel ready at all hours. When a proper degree of confidence appears to have been established then put the trap in its place and catch him--if you can. * * * First take a No. 3 Blake & Lamb trap, and look around over the fields or woods and find where the sand has washed down and is fine as wood ashes, says F. A. Aurand, of Michigan. You will always find if you keep close watch over the fields that a fox likes to get on the fine sand and play or walk over and around on it for some reason, as you will always find their tracks on the sand in the fall and spring. Now take for bait any of the following: dead chicken, or turkey, or beef's hind leg, but I think the best is beef's old head. Now take the old head, dig down in the sand and set the head down in the sand so that the jaws and nose are out of the sand about to the eyes. Now take your traps, about three No. 3 B. & L. traps, take a stake and fasten the rings to the stake, and drive the stake below the surface of the sand and cover it over the top. Now dig a small trench for the chains, lay the chains in the trenches, a trench for each chain. Spread the traps each way from the old head, and set the trap out away from the head as far as the chains will let them go, by driving the stake right close to the head. Then dig a small place in the sand so the trap will set just level with the surface of the sand, for each trap to set in. Take a small piece of cotton batton and put enough under each pan of the traps to keep the sand from getting under pans so they won't spring. Now take the sand that you took out of the places for the traps and cover them all over, traps, chains and all. Then take a small bush and brush out all your tracks and over the traps. If you have done your work well you can hardly tell where the traps are. You can use some good scent on the sand or on the old head, but I don't think it needs it. Fix the old head in the sand quite a little while before you want to trap. All I ever caught I caught in this way. If you do everything right I am sure of your success. * * * I have visited hundreds of trappers in Maine and Canada, and have learned many of the secrets of successful trapping from them and also from my own personal experience and observation, writes N. C. Burbank. I have come to the conclusion that the basis of all the most successful secret decoys for catching fox is the substance taken from the glands of the female fox during the running season, mixed with grease of some sort, together with contents of the glands of the skunk, preferably the female taken in the spring or latter part of the winter. I do not pretend to say that every one will be successful who uses that decoy. I am of the opinion, if directions are closely followed in the following method of water trapping for fox, you are reasonably sure to catch them if you use that decoy. During the month of August or September select some spring or place about a foot and a half from the edge, or in the center of a circular spring that is not over 4 feet wide, a sod 8 or 10 inches across, and arrange a place to set the trap a few inches from the outside. This must be done early in the season, so all evidence of human work and scent will be removed before trapping time. [Illustration: THE SPRING AND SOD SET.] When the season arrives you are ready to set your trap, and you do so in the following manner: In selecting springs you must find one that has an outlet so you can walk in the water for a distance of three rods, six or eight is better. Set your trap and take it up to the spring or place selected, walking in the water and using the greatest care not to touch bushes or anything to leave the scent of yourself. Place the trap in the place prepared in the early season, being sure it is covered over entirely, chain and all, by water. Then cover with dead leaves or whatever is on the bottom of the spring. Place upon the trap pan a small sod as light a one as possible, allowing it to be out of the water at least one inch so that the fox in reaching for the bait will step on the sod, which should be six or eight inches from the shore. Fox, like the human being, do not like to wet their feet. Now you have the trap set and then comes the baiting. Take a small piece of meat and place it on the larger sod, using great care not to leave human scent, take a few drops of this decoy and place on the bait. Also take a rotten stick and break off a piece 6 or 8 inches long, being careful of handling, and place two or three drops on the end and stick it into the sod so it will stick up two inches or such a matter above it. Your trap is now ready for Reynard, and if you use great care in setting and in visiting your traps I am certain of your success. There are many methods of catching foxes and I am acquainted with them, not all, perhaps, as each man has a little different way, but I am satisfied the above for a water set it correct. * * * Here in the East where I am trapping near the mountains, if we could not catch fox on the snow path we would not get any prime fur, says J. H. Shufelt, of Canada. I will give one of my snow sets that I use here for fox. It may not fit your case as every locality calls for its own method, and foxes are slyer in some places than others. I use a No. 3 Blake & Lamb trap with a three foot chain and grapple. How to fix the trap? I take a large kettle and fill with water and put my traps in and get the water boiling hot. For every dozen of traps I put in one-half pint of lime not air slacked, and boil for ten minutes. Now take out your traps, which will be odorless and white as snow, and use gloves in handling and setting them. [Illustration: ODORLESS AND WHITE AS SNOW.] When you get ready to set your traps go out in a large field where foxes are traveling, make a good path across the field by traveling back and forth. Where you want to make a set leave a little partition across the path to guide the fox in the trap, which is covered with white paper and a little snow. Be careful in setting and not leave tracks outside of the path nor lay any sticks across. When going to your traps walk in the path, which makes it better, and don't let too much snow get over them. Be careful and you will get your fox. Do foxes eat skunk? I might say in answer to this question they do, and they will kill skunk if found outside of their dens. And if a fox is run in a den where there is a skunk, their odor is most always sure to prove fatal to a fox in a very short time. Several instances of this kind have happened in this locality where I am hunting and trapping. Foxes are very fond of skunk for food, and the musk makes a good scent for trapping foxes. A good scent for cold weather, for it never freezes. No doubt a good trapper will say, give me fresh bait. I might say give me a strong smelling bait, for when the fox is smelling a strong bait or scent he cannot smell anything else at the same time. Now for instance, if you were going out for a fox hunt, and your hound got scented by skunk, it would spoil his scenting anything, and he could not follow the trail. Several experiences have led me to think this is one reason why we make a better catch on a damp or rainy night. The bait smells so much stronger that it takes up more of the game's sense of smell and makes our chance of a catch better. The old trapper will oftimes make this remark, ""Boys, I am going to make a big catch tonight--why, because it is going to be a damp and rainy night."" Who knows why? I trap foxes by land and water set. I sometimes use a set called the all around land set. Every locality calls for its own method. I use two kinds of traps, Blake & Lamb and Newhouse. They are both all right. My trapping grounds are near the mountains where the foxes defy fox hounds, for they have dens in the rocks. The Hunter-Trader-Trapper, Columbus, Ohio, is in touch with fox trappers, hunters and owners of hounds from all parts of America, so that interesting articles are constantly being received and published. [Illustration: CANADIAN TRAPPER AND FIFTEEN REDS.] The following, by W. J. Taylor, of New York, is his method for trapping the red fox: Choose a rotten stump near their runways, cut out a cavity in the top of the stump deep enough to set trap and allow one-half inch of finely pulverized rotten wood to cover trap, spring and chain. Do not handle pulverized wood with your hands. Have your traps thoroughly greased, chain and all, then smoke with hemlock, spruce, cedar or pine boughs. Smoke until trap and chain are black. This is to stop the smell of steel. Sometimes I use a moss covered stump, that is a stump with moss growing all or partly around its sides. Cut the cavity the same in stump, cover lightly with pulverized rotten wood. Now go to another moss covered stump, cut moss enough to cover top of stump, cut a circular piece out a little smaller than jaws of trap, place this right on top of trap, then place the rest on top of stump, trim outsides to match outside of stump. Handle moss with sharpened stick and knife, never with bare hands unless set is made one week before baiting and scenting. I generally make my sets two weeks before placing bait and scent. Place bait about six or eight feet from stump, always on lower hillside. Daub your fox scent on top of stump, side towards your bait. For bait I use muskrat carcasses, skunk, dead hens, rabbits, fish or partly decomposed meat. My receipt for fox scent is fish oil one-half pint (made by placing fish in glass can in summer and hanging in sun until decomposed) the musk sacks of ten or more muskrats, one or more fox matrix which are obtained from the female fox, also fat from the inside of either sex is good. Mix all together. It will surely draw the fox. [Illustration: ADIRONDACK TRAPPER.] CHAPTER XVII. REYNARD OUTWITTED. A good fox year can be counted upon with reasonable certainty once every five years, says Martin Hunter, on the Labrador coast, at least so say the oldest residents. The year before they begin to come down from the interior, then the climax for great numbers. Then the following year they decrease in numbers to what they were two years before, and the winter following so few that one or two about in miles of coast is a rarity. Such was the case in the winter of 71; 69 had been a great fox year. What was not trapped in the winter of 70 had migrated back to the remote interior. Between the posts of Scum Islands and Moisie, a distance of twenty-one miles of coast, there was only known to be one fox--a red one--with a claw missing on his right paw, and he was as cunning an old fellow as ever bothered a trapper. For a night or two he would play all kinds of tricks down about Moisie, and then we would hear of him around Seven Islands. There being no kind of hunting, the people got anxious as to who would succeed in catching the old rascal. Bait would be sprinkled about at certain places, and no traps. Big tail would come around and eat every scrap; this would be done for two or three nights in succession, and then the hunter would think the fox's fears were allayed, and carefully put two or three traps and the bait as usual. Next morning the bait would be gone, as before, but he would find his traps turned up side down. [Illustration: FOX TRAPS WITH DRAGS.] The fox we will say would pass and repass at a certain up-turned root or a point of trees, then the hunter would think a trap in his beaten track would surely nip him. Not so, however. The trap would be nicely concealed, but old Reynard would deflex his road to suit the circumstances. Smoking, greasing, or all the usual modes of taking the smell from the iron traps were of no avail; when a trap was set where his supper was spread, that old fox would begin by digging a trench from a distance off in a straight line for the hidden traps, the closer he got to the danger the slower and more cautiously he would work. This we could see plainly next morning by standing outside his works and reading his signs. There were better and older trappers in the field after this old stayer's life, but it was given to me to circumvent his maneuvers and possess his fur. I had reset my traps near the bait two nights in succession in the exact place where he had turned them over, and of course he burrowed along his old trench to get at them. This I carefully noted and set another trap in the trench on edge. Something told me I was going to be successful, and I hardly slept that night. I was on my snowshoes and off at the first grey of the February morning. Before I got to the point where my traps were set I saw his fresh tracks leading off in the same direction I was going. My heart beat with expectation and anticipation as I hurried forward; it was not for the value of the beast, but to have it to say I had killed the cunning fox of 1871 where all the old hunters had failed. Yes there he was sure enough, as I turned the last point; I could hardly credit my good fortune, and was so afraid that he would even now escape that I walked right on top of him with my snowshoes. He was pinned down tight with my weight and was powerless to even wriggle. I slipped my left hand under the snowshoe and with my other hand pulled down his heart; a quiver or two and that fox was a good fox. Indians never strike or shoot either foxes, mink or marten when they find them alive in the traps, as it causes the blood to collect and congeal where the blow was given, and spoils the looks of the skin, besides the annoyance of the blood when skinning. They hold the animal by the neck and with the other hand pull down the heart until the heart-strings break, and death is as sudden as if the spine were severed. CHAPTER XVIII. FOX SHOOTING. The fox, although the cleverest animal sought after by New England hunters and trappers, says L. W. Beardsley, of Connecticut, seems to have one decided drawback, that of sight, which frequently costs him his life. Sly and clever with very acute nose and ear, he appears to be unable to tell a man from a tree or stone by sight alone, provided the person remains motionless, but the slightest motion is detected and sends him dusting for cover. The above I have proved to my entire satisfaction time and again when hunting this animal, a few instances of which I will quote below. While walking along the tracks of the Berkshire Division R. R., which were bounded on the west by a steep hill with a fence three boards high, placed horizontally about eight inches apart skirting the track, I noticed beneath the lower board the legs of a fox moving toward me some seventy-five yards away. I stopped between the rails, half raising my 38-40 Stevens, telescope mounted, and waited for a favorable shot. When some thirty yards away the fox crawled under the fence and trotted down the bank immediately in front of me, where I stood in plain view. He stopped in the middle of the track and looked towards me unconcernedly for several seconds, then swung his head down the tracks in the direction of a train which was rapidly approaching from the south. This was my chance. I brought the cross hairs to bear just back of his foreleg and pulled. With one mighty bound in the air he fell back across the rails without a struggle, and I had to do some hustling to pull him out of the way before the train was upon us. [Illustration: KILLED BEFORE BREAKFAST.] Again I was sitting on a stone, my back against a wall in an open pasture lot waiting in hopes a fox might use the runway which passed close by. I had been waiting quietly since 4 A. M. It was now 6:30, and I had nearly given up hopes of seeing a fox that morning and was getting perhaps rather careless about watching, when something rustled in the grass, and raising my eyes without moving my head, I saw a red fox in the act of passing in front of me not more than ten or fifteen feet away in the open lot. I remained motionless until he was well past, then raising my gun slowly and carefully I fired at the back of his head as he was trotting leisurely away, all unconscious of my presence, and perhaps only saw twenty-five yards off. The fox never knew what had killed him, and I often wonder if that load of shot surprised him more than his sudden appearance surprised me, as I sat dozing on the rock. I used on this occasion a 10 ga. full choke Winchester, level action repeater Model 1901, loaded with 4 1/2 drs. black powder and 1 1/4 oz. B. shot. Late one afternoon several years ago while out hunting grey squirrel at Swamp Mortar Rock with Wm. E. Howes I, who was hunting about 200 yards south of ""Bill,"" heard a fox barking just over a rise of ground, and cautiously approaching saw two foxes digging at the roots of a decayed stump. Just as I was getting within effective gun shot range I stepped on a twig which snapped with my weight. The sound started the animals. Neither saw me, however, as I had remained perfectly motionless. The moment the twig broke one took a course due east, the other quartered toward me disappearing in the thick laurels. There was a small opening in these bushes opposite me, and with cocked gun trained on this spot I waited the appearance of the fox. In a moment he was in the clearing, and as he was stepping over a log about 30 yards away I gave him my right barrel and tumbled him over, and as he endeavored to get up I put on the finishing touches with my left. I was using a Baker full choke 28 in. 12 ga. loaded with 3 1/4 drs. black powder with 1 1/8 oz. No. 7 shot. [Illustration: RESULTS OF A THREE DAYS HUNT.] While looking for woodchuck signs early one spring on my way to pasture, I was following a old logging road when I saw a fox crossing in front of me and disappear in the ferns, going toward a high ledge west of the road. I stood still and waited. When the fox reached the lower part of the ledge he stopped about 75 or 80 yards from me and sat down. When his head was turned away I would sneak cautiously a few feet nearer, always standing motionless when he looked my way, and thus reduced the distance between us to about 50 yards. At this point just as I was about to shoot the fox, who was partially concealed with leaves and ferns, moved some 10 yards up the ledge and was getting uneasy, although he had not seen me, and the wind was unfavorable for closer approach. I waited and he climbed nearly to the top of the ledge and laid down on a flat rock in the sun. With the utmost caution I slowly crawled back to the road and approached his foxship from the west, keeping some large rocks between us until I had approached within 35 yards. He was sitting up, breast toward me as I cautiously peeped over a rock, but his head was turned away, so I stepped out into plain view, leveling my gun as I did so. Slowly the fox turned his head and faced me, but he appeared to see nothing unusual in the silent figure clad in the worn gray hunting coat, brown overalls and soft brown hat. I could see him twitch his ears and blink his eyes lazily in the glare of the setting sun. Fully a minute I stood admiring the picture. It seemed a pity to kill this clever fellow I had so easily outwitted. My eye dropped a little lower, the brass bead trembled on his breast, and through the faint haze of smokeless powder I saw the old quail thief kicking and struggling in the edge of the ledge. A moment later he toppled over his carcass, bounding from rock to rock in its 50 foot descent. I was using a 12 ga. full choke 30 in. Stevens, smokeless and B shot. Another time I was sitting in the woods for grey squirrel early in October. It was about 5:30 A. M. and just getting light. I heard the tread of an animal behind me and the rustle of leaves, which ceased a few feet away. By rolling my eyes and slightly moving my head I could see the outlines of a fox standing behind me, hardly ten feet away. Cautiously I attempted to move the muzzle of my gun in his direction, but he detected me immediately and disappeared midst the laurels like a flash. Although he had stood two or three minutes within a few feet of me before I attempted to turn evidently trying to figure out what I was, not until I had made a movement did he realize he was so near his old enemy, ""man,"" which goes to show that Mr. Fox, with every other sense alert, is like many other of his wild brethren, unable to tell man from an inanimate by mere sight alone, when he remains motionless. CHAPTER XIX. A SHREWD FOX. Several years ago, when foxes were more numerous here than they are now, the writer, R. B., of Canada, in company with two other hunters, went on a fox hunting expedition. We had two dogs which had not been trained but would follow a trail pretty well. We had to travel over newly-made ice a distance of three miles to a small island about a mile long and quite narrow, on which were three small groves of fir trees which was the only cover for game, the surface of the island being chiefly meadow and marsh land. We landed on the eastern end of the island, and within a short time after the hunt began one of the party shot a fox, and in the afternoon the writer got a chance at a shot and succeeded in knocking over a very fine red fox. As night was now near we started for home, intending to return next day and renew the hunt, as we knew there was yet another fox on the island. Next day, however, was stormy, and we postponed the hunt till the following day, which being fine gave us a good chance for our work. [Illustration: ALWAYS HUNGRY.] The same party of hunters and dogs renewed the chase early in the morning but the fox seemed to have learned a lesson from the previous hunt, and all day long he was chased from grove to grove by the dogs without giving a chance of a shot at him. As night was fast approaching we began to fear our hunt was going to be unsuccessful when we discovered that the fox had changed his tactics, and instead of taking shelter in the groves had run clear out to one end of the island, which was very narrow, and as we thought would take to the ice and thus get away from us. However, we followed after him, and you may imagine our surprise when the fox, instead of going on the ice, suddenly turned around and came directly toward us, and when about one hundred yards distant suddenly disappeared as if the earth had swallowed him up; one of the party who knew there was an old uncovered well there shouted out, ""the fox is in the well!"" We all hastened to the spot, and sure enough there was Mr. Fox in the well clinging to some sticks floating in the water about eight feet below the surface of the ground. As we had no rope or any facilities for getting reynard out of the well alive, we had to take a mean and unsportsmanlike advantage of our prisoner by putting a small charge of shot into his head and then fishing him out of the water with a forked stick. That the fox could never have gotten out of the well by his own exertions I do not believe, but that he went into it to escape from us is certain. CHAPTER XX. STILL-HUNTING THE FOX. Many have requested me to give my method of still-hunting the red fox. As my hair is turning gray and the red foxes are about all gone here I will give an outline of my method, and will try and not weary the reader with a long account, thus writes G. O. Green, of Illinois. Winter is the best time for hunting the red fox, and I have been more successful in January and February than other months. There are always some localities where the red fox spends the day, curled up asleep, and it is generally in a hilly locality as far as he can get from the presence of man. The still hunter has only to go to these places on fair days and hunt as far as possible against the wind. If the wind is blowing some so much the better--it will help to deaden the sound of the hunter's tread. When you get into likely ground walk slow, and be sure you observe every object on the ground, both in front and in fact at least three sides. The average still hunter hunts too fast and don't use his eyes in the right direction--if he is a bird hunter he will be looking up in the trees too much. [Illustration: BLACK FOX SKIN VALUED AT $1500.] A red fox is a small animal, and the hunter must keep his eyes always on the ground while hunting the old Red. If snow is on the ground and the hunter jumps a fox without getting a shot, the hunter, if he is a novice, will be pretty sure to go on the run after the fox when he comes to the place where the fox has just jumped. When you find the fox has been jumped sit right down and eat your lunch, and wait twenty minutes or a half hour. The fox will run perhaps 80 rods then get on a log or stump and watch his back track, and if he does not see any one following him he will not go far before he will look for another place to lie down. When you come to a place where the fox makes zigzag trail, stop and look very close in every direction for at least one hundred yards. The fox rarely makes a straight trail when he is going to lie down; in this he resembles the deer. The fox sleeps most soundly between 11 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the daytime, and I have killed most of mine during that time. A fox jumped after 3 o'clock in the afternoon will hardly lie down again that day. A double-barrel shotgun loaded with No. 4 shot will stop any fox up to about 50 yards; above that distance coarser shot usually straddle the fox. When the day is cold and snow is crusty, stay at home, for you will get no fox but plenty of exercise. When a fox goes into the ground while you are trailing him, don't try to dig him out; it is hard work. On three occasions I have got his brush by going to the burrow about sundown and getting a good position near the burrow to wait for him to come out. I have never been disappointed in getting a shot about the time that you can see half a dozen stars twinkling. But it takes good eyes to see a fox in twilight. Now reader, these are not all the points of still hunting. It takes a peculiar cuss for a still hunter, and still hunters are born that way; all the education in the world will not make a still hunter. CHAPTER XXI. FOX RANCHES. It is estimated that at present nearly 50 of the Aleutian Islands have fox ranches, most of which are said to have been successfully managed. Thus far the Government has rented the islands for this purpose at $100 per year. Some years ago the revenue cutter Perry was sent to the Archipelago by the Treasury Department for the express purpose of ascertaining the location of the islands used for fox ranches. The Government's agents were not long in finding out that in several instances the fox raisers had appropriated islands for which they were paying no rental. These persons were brought up with a sharp turn and ordered to pay up or shut up shop. It seems quite clear that where proper business methods have been followed the ranches, without exception, have succeeded thus far, and will prove immensely valuable in the future. On some of the islands the work has been going on for 12 or 15 years, and three of them now have a fox population of more than 1,000 each. The first method was to begin operations by turning loose on an island several pairs of foxes. In some instances the animals have increased rapidly, with the result that in a year or so it had become apparent that $150 or $200 paid for a pair of mated animals was likely to prove a good investment. [Illustration: NORTHERN FOX TRAPPER'S DOG TEAM.] The original project was to breed the silver gray fox, as the fur of this animal is much more valuable than that of the commoner varieties. A good silver gray pelt is worth about $50 to the original seller, while $15 or thereabout is the price for the pelt of the blue fox. But the silver gray has many peculiarities which make its domestication exceedingly difficult, practically impossible, in fact. It is much given to devouring its young, and it has many of the characteristics of the wolf. At present only one of the islands is given up to the silver grays, and the animals do not increase rapidly. The blue fox, so called, is handled much more successfully. It is readily tamed, and if kindly treated soon becomes so domestic that it will take food from the keeper's hand. The food usually is fish, either cooked or raw, and a mixture of corn meal and tallow. Reynard gets these rations, and all he wants of them, for ten months in the year, the food being supplied steadily except during the two midsummer months. It is estimated that the average cost of the rations is $1.50 per fox per year. There are two or three keepers for each ranch who devote all their time the year around to their charges. From November 20 to January 20 is the open season for foxes on the islands, and box traps, rather than dead falls or steel traps, are used. This is done because all the female animals are released, after having been marked, and also one male for every six of the opposite sex. The average age for killing is about 18 months, although the pelt of an animal eight months old is fully developed, and, despite some theories to the contrary, the fur does not necessarily improve with age. On some of the larger farms, the box trap method of catching the foxes has been given up, as being too slow, for baiting the animals near a small corral. During the months preceding the killing time, the food for the foxes is placed near the site of this corral, in order to accustom the animals to coming to that locality, and also in order to tame them. Under this treatment the foxes lose their shyness and shrewdness to such an extent that they not only enter the corral freely, but the female or male which has once been released after having been examined and marked, frequently enters the corral again. It is reported that in some instances the same animal has been caught three or four times in the same night. CHAPTER XXII. STEEL TRAPS. In sections the larger game is gone yet there is in parts of the North, West and South much good trapping territory that will pay the hardy trappers for years to come. Even in the more thickly settled districts trapping can be made a good paying business. It seems that red fox, skunk and muskrat remain about as numerous in most sections as ever. In fact, the red fox in certain sections has only made its appearance of late years--since the country has become more thickly settled. Trappers in most sections can rest assured that they will have game to trap for years to come. In the rapid development of the country the steel trap has played a wonderful part. They have subdued the monster bear and have as well caught millions of the small fur bearing animals, adding largely to the annual income of the hardy trapper. Steel traps have been in use for more than fifty years, but for many years after they were invented they were so expensive that they were not generally used. Of late years they have become cheaper and their use has become general. In fact, the price is now so reasonable that the trapper, on his first expedition, has a supply. The professional trapper, who in the North, spends from seven to nine months in the woods has a supply of these traps, ranging from the smallest to the largest. His needs are such too that all of them are in use during the trapping season. A trapper can use from 50 to 250 traps. Traps are made in various sizes. The smallest No. 0 is used for gophers, rats, etc., while the largest, No. 6, is for the grizzly bear and will hold him. The No. 2 is known as the fox trap having two springs and spread of jaws of 4 7/8 inches. The No. 1 1/2 single spring is also much used by fox trappers. The No. 1 will also hold the fox, but we think best to use the No. 1 1/2 or No. 2. We are alluding to the Newhouse manufactured by the Oneida Community, Ltd., Oneida, N. Y., as it is acknowledged to be the best trap in the world. As most fox trappers devote more or less time to trapping other fur bearing animals, a description of the various Newhouse traps, telling the animal or animals each size is adapted to, etc., will no doubt be of Interest. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 0 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 3 1/2 inches. This, the smallest trap made, is used mostly for catching the gopher, a little animal which is very troublesome to western farmers, and also rats and other vermin. It has a sharp grip and will hold larger game, but should not be overtaxed. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 1 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. This Trap is used for catching muskrats and other small animals, and sold in greater numbers than any other size. Its use is well understood by professional trappers and it is the most serviceable size for catching skunks, weasels, rats and such other animals as visit poultry houses and barns. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 81 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. Occasionally animals free themselves from traps by gnawing their legs off just below the trap jaws, where the flesh is numb from pressure. Various forms of traps have been experimented with to obviate this difficulty. The Webbed Jaws shown above have proved very successful in this respect. Noting the cross-section of the jaws, as illustrated at the left, it is plain the animal can only gnaw off its leg at a point quite a distance below the meeting edges. The flesh above the point of amputation and below the jaws will swell and make it impossible to pull the leg stump out of the trap. The No. 81 Trap corresponds in size with the regular No. 1 Newhouse. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 91 TRAP] Spread of Jaws--#91, 5 1/4 inches; #91 1/2, 6 1/4 inches. The double jaws take an easy and firm grip so high up on the muskrat that he can not twist out. A skunk cannot gnaw out either. These traps are especially good for Muskrat, Mink, Skunk and Raccoon. All parts of the No. 91 except the jaws are the same size as the regular No. 1 Newhouse, while the 91 1/2 corresponds to the regular No. 1 1/2. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 1 1/2 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. This size is called the Mink Trap. It is, however, suitable for catching the Woodchuck, Skunk, etc. Professional trappers often use it for catching Foxes. It is very convenient in form and is strong and reliable. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 2 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. The No. 2 Trap is called the Fox Trap. Its spread of jaws is the same as the No. 1 1/2 but having two springs it is, of course, much stronger. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 3 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 5 1/2 inches. This, the Otter Trap, is very powerful. It will hold almost any game smaller than a bear. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 4 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This is the regular form of Beaver Trap. It is longer than the No. 3 Trap, and has one inch greater spread of jaws. It is a favorite with those who trap and hunt for a living in the Northwest and Canada. It is also extensively used for trapping the smaller Wolves and Coyotes in the western stock raising regions. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 2 1/2 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. In some localities the Otter grows to an unusual size, with great proportionate strength, so that the manufacturers have been led to produce an especially large and strong pattern. All the parts are heavier than the No. 2 1/2, the spread of jaws greater and the spring stiffer. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 3 1/2 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 5 inches. The above cut represents a Single Spring Otter Trap. It is used more especially for catching Otter on their ""slides."" For this purpose a thin, raised plate of steel is adjusted to the pan so that when the trap is set the plate will be a trifle higher than the teeth on the jaws. The spring is very powerful, being the same as used on the No. 4 Newhouse Trap. The raised plate can be readily detached if desired, making the trap one of general utility. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 21 1/2 TRAP] Single Spring. Same as No. 2 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate. No. 31 1/2 NEWHOUSE TRAP. Single Spring. Same as No. 3 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate. Spread of Jaws--No. 21 1/2, 5 1/4 inches; No. 31 1/2, 6 1/2 inches. These Traps are the largest smooth jaw, single spring sizes that are made. Professional trappers will find these especially valuable when on a long trapping line, as they are more compact and easier to secrete than the large double spring traps. The springs are made extra heavy. Note.--The 21 1/2 is practically a single spring No. 3 and the 31 1/2 a single spring No. 4. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 14 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This Trap is the same in size as the No. 4 Beaver, but has heavier and stiffer springs and offset jaws, which allow the springs to raise higher when the animal's leg is in the trap, and is furnished with teeth sufficiently close to prevent the animal from pulling its foot out. [Illustration: CLUTCH DETACHABLE TRAP] Clutch Detachable--Trap can be used with or without it. PATENTED. Spread of Jaws, No. 23, 5 1/2 inches; No. 24, 6 1/4 inches. The inventor of this attachment claims to have had wonderful success with it in taking Beaver. The trap should be set with the clutch end farthest from shore. The beaver swims with his fore legs folded back against his body, and when he feels his breast touch the bank he puts them down. The position of the trap can be so calculated that he will put his fore legs in the trap, when the clutch will seize him across the body and hold him securely. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 4 1/2 TRAP] In response to a demand for a new model of the Newhouse Trap especially adapted to catching wolves, the manufacturers have perfected a trap which is numbered 4 1/2 and is called the ""Newhouse Wolf Trap."" This trap has eight inches spread of jaw, with other parts in proportion, and is provided with a pronged ""drag,"" a heavy snap and an extra heavy steel swivel and chain, five feet long, warranted to hold 2,000 pounds. The trap complete with chain and ""drag"" weighs about nine pounds. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 50 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is intended for catching small sized Bears. In design it is exactly like the standard No. 5 Bear Trap, only that the parts are all somewhat smaller. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 150 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is identical with No. 5 excepting that the jaws are offset, making a space five-eighths inch between them. This allows the springs to come up higher when the bear's foot is in the trap, and thus secure a better grip. Also there is less chance of breaking the bones of the foot. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 5 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. This trap weighs nineteen pounds. It is used for taking the common Black Bear and is furnished with a very strong chain. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 15 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. To meet the views of certain hunters whose judgment is respected, the manufacturers designed a style of jaw for the No. 5 trap, making an offset of 3/4 of an inch, so as to allow the springs to come up higher when the bear's leg is in the trap. This gives the spring a better grip. Those wishing this style should specify ""No. 15."" [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 6 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 16 inches. Weight, complete, 42 pounds. This is the strongest trap made. We have never heard of anything getting out of it when once caught. It is used to catch lions and tigers, as well as the great Grizzly Bears of the Rocky Mountains. [Illustration: BEAR CHAIN CLEVIS AND BOLT] This cut illustrates Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt, intended as a substitute for the ring on the end of the trap chain, when desired. With this clevis a loop can be made around any small log or tree without the trouble of cutting to fit the ring. The chain is made five feet long, suitable for any clog, and the prices of bear traps fitted with it are the same as with the regular short chain and ring. [Illustration: TRAP SETTING CLAMP] Every trapper knows how difficult it is to set a large trap alone in the woods, especially in cold weather, when the fingers are stiff, and the difficulty is greatly increased when one has to work in a boat. One of these clamps applied to each spring will, by a few turns of the thumb-screws, bend the springs to their places, so that the pan may be adjusted without difficulty. No. 4 Clamp can be used on any trap smaller than No. 4 1 /2. No. 5 and 6 are strong clamps, carefully made and especially adapted to setting the large traps Nos. 4 1/2 to 6. They dispense with the inconvenient and dangerous use of levers. With them one can easily set these powerful traps. These clamps are also useful about camp for other purposes.

[Illustration] ON SNAKE-POISON. ITS ACTION AND ITS ANTIDOTE. BY A. MUELLER, M.D. SYDNEY: L. BRUCK, MEDICAL PUBLISHER, 13 CASTLEREAGH STREET. 1893. SYDNEY: WEBDALE, SHOOSMITH & CO., PRINTERS, 117 CLARENCE STREET. 1893. PREFACE. Since the method of treating snakebite-poisoning by hypodermic injections of strychnine, discovered by the writer and published but a few years ago, has already been adopted by the medical profession throughout the Australian colonies, and practised even by laymen in cases of urgency with much success, it has been repeatedly suggested to him that the subject calls for further elucidation at his hands; that the morbid processes engendered by the snake venom and the _modus operandi_ of the antidote should be explained by him in a manner satisfying the demands of science, and at the same time within the grasp of the intelligent, moderately educated layman. When the latter, in a case of pressing emergency and in the absence of medical aid, is called upon to administer a potent drug in heroic doses, the aggregate of which would be attended by serious consequences in the absence of the deadly ophidian virus, an intelligent insight alone into the process he is about to initiate will give him that decision and promptitude of action, on the full exercise of which on his part it may depend whether, within a few hours, a valuable and to him probably dear life will be saved or lost. The foregoing applies, not to Australia only, but to all other countries infested by venomous snakes. The introduction of the writer's method in every one of these countries is merely a question of time, for snake-poison acts everywhere according to one uniform principle, however different the symptoms it produces may appear to the superficial observer. The antidote, therefore, that cures snakebite in Australia will as surely cure it elsewhere if properly and efficiently applied. To his Australian confrÃ¨res, more especially to those who adopted his method but had to practise it more or less empirically, the writer also owes a more elaborate explanation of his theory of the action of snake-poison in all its bearings on the various nerve centres than is to be found in the scattered writings he has from time to time published in our periodical literature. His warmest thanks are due to them for the records of cases they have furnished to the _Australasian Medical Gazette_, and to the Hon. J. M. Creed, its able editor, for the ample space he has invariably allotted to the subject, and the valuable support he has given him throughout. By our united efforts we have reared in a dark and hitherto barren field of research a column of solid knowledge, and on this column Australia now occupies the highest and will ever occupy the most prominent place. Not the least pleasing feature in the history of this discovery is the fact that it has been made without an elaborate series of experiments on animals, that it is a peaceful conquest not attained by means of doubtful justification, and which have hitherto invariably failed in their object. This object--the discovery of the coveted antidote--instead of being brought nearer, was, in fact, further removed by every succeeding series of experiments. However fruitful in results this mode of research has been in other domains, in this particular one it has not only been a failure but an actual bar to progress. Nature invariably refused to yield her secret when thus interrogated. The tortured animals, like the victims of Torquemada, either did not answer at all or they answered with a lie, and the baffled experimenter abandoned his task in despair. Still, these negative results notwithstanding, the writer is confronted by a certain class of would-be rigorous scientists, who tell him that his theory of the action of snake-poison, though it explains all the phenomena, cannot be accepted as correct until it has been proven so by strict test experiments on animals, and that the successful administration of the antidote is proof only of the fact of neither antidote nor snake-poison having killed the patients, who, probably, might have recovered if left to themselves. This may be strict logic, but common sense replies to it that if recovery takes place after proper administration of the antidote in cases which, according to all our previous experience, would have ended fatally, it is not illogical to assume that antidote and recovery stand in the relation of cause and effect. This sceptical attitude of the scientific mind can justly be maintained only with regard to cases limited in number and in which the symptoms left room for doubt as to their final result, but in view of the formidable and constantly increasing records of cures from snakebite during the last three years, it is, to say the least of it, unreasonable. The demand for experiments on animals, in proof of the correctness of his theory, the writer does not feel called upon to satisfy, for, apart from the theory proving itself by explaining all the symptoms the snake-poison produces, it has also stood the test of practical application. It is proven to be correct by the success of the antidote to which it led, and which is the logical outcome of it. After finally attaining a goal one has striven for, it is quite unnecessary to retrace one's steps with a view of ascertaining whether the road that has led up to it is the right and proper one. By a fortuitous concurrence of circumstances, however, even this demand for experiments shall be satisfied in these pages. The writer published his theory of the action of snake-poison in May, 1888, after having practised the strychnine treatment for some years and thoroughly satisfied himself of its efficacy. In the latter part of 1888 accounts of Feoktistow's researches reached this country. His final conclusions to the effect that snake-poison is solely a nerve poison, that it does not destroy protoplasm, and has no effect whatever on the blood to which its destructive potency on animal life can be ascribed, were in complete harmony with the writer's views, in fact, a re-statement of his theory. It was a strange coincidence, or whatever it may be called, that, independent of each other, at almost opposite parts of the globe, and by opposite methods, we had arrived at almost identical conclusions. Those of Feoktistow were drawn from 400 elaborate experiments on animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, made in the laboratory of Professor Kobert at the University of Dorpat and in that of Professor Owsjannikow at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. The writer's conclusions, on the other hand, resulted entirely from a careful and happy analysis of the symptoms observed at the bedside of his patients suffering from snakebite. On one point only, but the most important one, he differs from Feoktistow. The latter shared the fate of all previous experimenters on animals. Though his experiments with snake-poison led him to the correct theory of its action, and even to the correct antidote, his experiments with strychnine and snake-poison were a failure. The animals experimented on died, and, falling into the error of his predecessors, mistaking the functional analogy that exists between the nerve centres of the lower animals and those of man for absolute identity, which does not exist, especially not when they are under the influence of the two poisons, he concluded his researches with the confession that a physiological antidote for snake-poison cannot even be thought of at the present state of science. Although, therefore, Feoktistow's labors would have led to no practical result, they are, nevertheless, a most valuable contribution to science as being the first to demonstrate the action of snake-poison on a strictly scientific, experimental basis. For this reason, and with so high an authority as Professor Kobert vouching for the correctness of the experiments, they will be frequently quoted hereafter. [Illustration] HISTORICAL REVIEW. Snakebite and its cure have always been the despair of medical science. On no other subject has our knowledge remained for centuries so unsatisfactory, fragmentary and empirical. The history of the subject, in fact, may be summed up briefly as a series of vain and spasmodic attempts to solve the problem of snakebite-poisoning and wring from nature the coveted antidote. Various and contradictory theories of the action of snake-poison have been propounded, some absolutely erroneous, others containing a modicum of truth mixed with a large proportion of error, but none but one fulfilling the indispensable condition of accounting for all the phenomena observable during the poisoning process and of reducing the formidable array of conflicting symptoms to order by finding the law that governs them all. We have the advocates of the blood-poison theory ascribing the palpable nerve-symptoms to imaginary blood changes produced by the subtle poison, and alleged to have been discovered by the willing, but frequently deceiving microscope. Even bacteriology has been laid under service and innocent leucocytes have been converted under the microscope into deadly germs, introduced by the reptile, multiplying with marvellous rapidity in the blood of its victims, appropriating to themselves all the available oxygen and producing carbonic acid, as the saccharomyces does in alcoholic fermentation. Others again, and among them those supposed to be the highest authorities on the subject now living, divide the honors between nerve and blood. Some snakes they allege are nerve-poisoners others as surely poison the blood, but with one solitary exception they assume the terminations of the motor-nerves and not the centres to be affected. Thus then with regard to theories we have hitherto had ""confusion worse confounded,"" and as with theories so it has been with antidotes. They were proposed in numbers, but only to be given up again, some intended to decompose and destroy the subtle poison in the system, others to counteract its action on the system with that action unknown. It is scarcely too much to assert that there are but few chemicals and drugs in the materia medica that have not been tried as antidotes in experiments on animals and dozens upon dozens that have been tried in vain on man. The reasons for this somewhat chaotic state of our science on a subject of so much interest to mankind are various. The countries of Europe, in which scientific research is most keenly pursued, have but few indigenous, and these comparatively harmless snakes. The best scientific talent has, therefore, only exceptionally been brought to bear on the subject. In those countries on the other hand in which venomous snakes abound and opportunities for observing the poison-symptoms on man are more plentiful, the observing element has been comparatively deficient. A still more potent source of failure must be sought in the faulty methods of research pursued by most investigators. Experiments on animals were far too much resorted to, and their frequently misleading results accepted as final, whilst observations on man did not receive the attention their importance demanded. In the investigation of this subject the first desideratum was no doubt to find the correct theory of the action of snake poison and to define the law governing that action, assuming as a working hypothesis that there is but one law for all snake-poison and not several ones, just as there is one law for the structure of these reptiles, admitting of variations, but not of absolute divergence from the general plan. The shortest and surest way to find this law is close observation and careful analysis of the symptoms produced by the poison on man, and as the opportunities for such observation are not of frequent occurrence to the individual, co-operation and careful comparison of notes on the part of many observers. This method of investigation, which, during the last few years, has been pursued in Australia with most satisfactory results, was never practised anywhere else, not even in America, but instead of it each observer, with few exceptions, kept his own notes to himself, and if there happened to be one here and there hungry for more knowledge than his scanty opportunities for observation on man would supply, his resort was usually experiments on animals. A few snakes were caught, a few luckless dogs or other animals procured, and the slaughter of the innocents began. As test experiments to confirm observations on man, or made with a view of finding a correct theory of the action of snake-poison, these attempts were unobjectionable, although, without an elaborate scientific apparatus and in other than skilled hands, they were not likely to produce results of any value. But most of the experimenters were not content with purely theoretical aims. They were seeking to find the antidote by a purely empirical method, and had nothing to guide them in the choice of drugs. A dose of snake-poison was administered to an animal, and then a dose of some drug or chemical, chosen _ad libitum_, sent after it. Next day another presumed antidote was tried, another animal slaughtered, and so on _ad nauseam_, until finally the baffled antidote-searcher, not one whit the wiser for all his trouble and the useless tortures inflicted, confessed himself beaten and joined in the ""_non possums_"" of his predecessors. One important point has been completely left out of sight and ignored in all this experimenting on animals. It is the fact that the action of snake-poison on the human system and on that of animals, more especially dogs, though very similar, is not absolutely identical, and that for this reason alone results of experiments on the latter cannot be indiscriminately applied to man. As pointed out before, analogy has been confounded with identity. When a dog, for instance, has been bitten by a snake he does not usually collapse as quickly as a human being, but is able to drag himself about much longer before his hind legs refuse their service and he is unable to walk. This longer duration of the first stage of the poisoning process is no doubt owing to a higher organisation and greater functional power of the motor nerve centres of dogs. The amount of motor force at their disposal is greater, and hence they offer greater resistance to the invader seeking to turn off this force. When finally the latter gains the ascendency, irregular discharges of motor nerve force still take place and find their expression in convulsions, which in man only exceptionally occur. But the difference between man and dog becomes more marked yet when strychnine is administered to a dog suffering from snake-poison. It counteracts the latter quite as effectually in a dog as in man, but has to be injected with extreme caution, for whilst in man a slight excess in the quantity required to subdue the snake-virus is not only harmless, but actually necessary, any excess of it in a dog will at once produce violent tetanic convulsions and cause the animal to die even quicker than the snake-poison would have killed it, if allowed to run its course. In the face of these facts the judiciousness of the proposal lately made both here and in India to subject the strychnine treatment of snakebite once more to a series of test experiments on animals appears more than questionable. Another cause that has largely contributed to render experiments on animals so barren of results must be sought in the injudicious selection of substances intended to serve as antidotes. It is simply impossible to act on an organic compound like snake-poison, coursing through a living system, by chemicals that will either combine with it or decompose it in a manner likely to deprive it of its deadly qualities and render it innocuous. Yet what do we find? Acids and alkalis, arsenic, bromides and iodides, chlorine, mercurial preparations, &c., &c., have been poured into the luckless animals as if they were so many test tubes. A chemical antidote, a substance possessing special affinity to snake-poison and by means of this affinity combining with it in some mysterious and incomprehensible manner, one can hardy imagine to exist. Physiological antidotes, on the other hand, substances acting on the system in a manner the exact reverse of, and in direct antagonism to the snake-poison, though apparently the only feasible ones, have been strangely neglected and almost despised by experimenters. In the vast storehouse of Nature the department most likely to furnish such antidotes is the vegetable kingdom. The untutored human mind has for centuries past intuitively clung to this idea, and sought among plants for remedies against the deadly ophidian poison. Hence the great number of vegetable antidotes that have from time to time been recommended and the efficacy of some of which at least has been confirmed by reliable observations. But the hint thus given to science was not taken. Instead of research being pushed on diligently in the only direction that promised any chance of success, it was cut short by the baneful method of experimenting on animals. When it had been demonstrated that a dog, a cat, or other animal, after having been saturated with snake-poison, did not recover after the administration of an alleged antidote, the illogical conclusion was drawn at once that it could not possibly be of any use to man, whilst, in reality, the only proof rendered by the experiment, if made properly, was that the respective antidote could not be relied on in treating animals of the class experimented on. That some of these despised antidotes are worth a little further investigation may, in the light of present experience as to the value of strychnine in snakebite, be inferred from the fact, that among them is the wood of _Strychnos Colubrina_, and also the well-known _Huang Noo_, a vegetable extract made from another variety of the Strychnos family, and largely used by the Chinese, whilst, according to a letter in the _Australasian Medical Gazette_, July, 1892, the principal ingredient of a strange compound used by the native snake doctors of Central America with much success is _Nux Vomica_. It is superfluous to enter into a criticism of the treatment of snakebite until recently in vogue, for, with the exception of the local one by ligature and excision, it stands self-condemned by its complete inefficiency. It may be summed up as a vain attempt to stem the collapse invariably attending snakebite by the administration of stimulants, such as alcohol, ether, ammonia, &c. The attempt is vain, for a person in collapse from snakebite cannot be stimulated by any of these remedies, since neither the heart nor the nerve centres respond to them in the slightest degree, as they do in the absence of snake-poison, the only one that has any effect at all in slight cases being ammonia. But the attempt is not only in vain, it is highly injurious, especially if made with the usual large doses of alcohol, for, in addition to the latter not having the slightest influence on the snake-poison and its baneful effects, they act as an anÃ¦sthetic and thus add to the existing depression, besides increasing the tendency to internal hÃ¦morrhage. It might, under these circumstances, have been expected that any new method of treating snakebite, based on scientific grounds and holding out a sure prospect of success, would be hailed with pleasure, and that conservatism, opposing the new simply on account of its newness, would refrain from its usual tactics in a case where there was really nothing to conserve. But this was not to be, and strange, indeed, it would have been if the writer had escaped the opposition which is almost invariably offered to the discoverer. It appears to be one of the laws of human evolution, wisely designed to prevent precipitate advance, that every new discovery must run the gauntlet of men whose mission it is to act as brakes on the wheels of progress. Of the opposition which has been offered to the strychnine treatment it would, therefore, be folly to complain, but just cause of complaint is furnished by the unscientific attitude which was assumed from the very first and has been maintained throughout by its opponents. Not a single attempt has been made to disprove the correctness of the theory on which it is founded, yet to leave this theory unquestioned but object to the conclusion to which it leads, must strike even the lay mind as a most illogical proceeding. It is self-evident that, when strychnine is administered as an antidote to snake-poison, the quantity of it injected must be in proportion to that of snake-venom present in the system, and that the doses in which we dispense it in ordinary practice must be entirely left out of sight. Still, in the face of these obvious conclusions, we have had veterans, grave and grey, arguing pompously that the heroic doses advocated by the writer could not be countenanced, and that even medical men could not be entrusted with the serious task of administering them. Even as late as the last medical congress at Sydney this absurd objection to large doses of the antidote was again brought forward. After quantities averaging from half a grain to a grain have been injected many times in Australia with continuous success, after Banerjee has even gone as high as three and four grains in India without a single failure, and without in one single instance serious strychnine symptoms being evoked, the writer of the paper on ""Snakebite and its Cure"" based his principal objection to the treatment on the alleged ground of there not being sufficient evidence before us to justify heroic doses and show them to be safe in practice. When people wilfully shut their eyes against the most conclusive evidence, it is improbable that any amount of it would satisfy them. Apart, however, from the fully proven antagonism between the two poisons rendering the large doses of the antidote, which in all serious cases are indispensable, perfectly safe, the fear of strychnine is, in itself, a very strange aberration of judgment on the part of my opponents, considering how easy it is to counteract any noteworthy excess in its action, if, perchance, it should occur through unnecessary overdosing, by appropriate remedies. All other objections to the treatment require but to be glanced at to show their absurdity. Certain crude experiments on dogs made many years ago in India, and put forward as irrefutable at first, have been abandoned of late, and my learned opponents have now taken up a position in their stronghold of statistics, supposed to be impregnable, but in reality only the last refuge of the destitute, a position from which, by dexterous handling of alleged facts, anything and everything can be proven, in short, to use a strong expression, not my own, a convenient and respectable form of lying. By means of these statistics they try to prove, in the first place, that Australian snake-poison is not at all the insidious death-dealing agent it is supposed to be, since, according to statistics, only 126 persons died from it in three colonies within the last ten years. Further study of these statistics leads them to the inference that a strong healthy adult will recover from snakebite _without any treatment_, and thus they finally arrive at the conclusion aimed at, that persons cured by strychnine injections would probably have recovered without them. These are the inferences drawn by men, who, practising in towns, have probably never seen a case of snakebite. How do they tally with the facts of the case? It is true that the mortality among those bitten by snakes is small here as compared with India, though the poison of our snakes, quantity for quantity, has been proven to be quite as deadly as that of the Indian ones. Our greater immunity is due to our snakes giving off less poison at a bite, and with their short and (excepting those of the death adder) merely grooved poison fangs injecting it very superficially, thus making the process of elimination of the poison by ligature and incision or excision of the punctures much more easy and successful. It is to this treatment, which, as a rule; is immediately adopted in the bush, that our small mortality is due. Our children are taught it in school, and the most illiterate bushman knows how to carry it out. Where it is omitted by persons not knowing that they are bitten until the poison has been absorbed recovery is as rare as it is with the ox and the horse left to themselves without any treatment. But it requires a prodigious stretch of the logical faculty to understand what our small mortality from snakebite has to do with the intrinsic merits of the strychnine treatment. Even if nobody died at all its effects in doing away with the misery and suffering, which, before its introduction, invariably followed snakebite, and often was never got rid of completely, would still be sufficiently beneficial to render the senseless opposition to it on the part of a small section of medical men little short of criminal; for these effects are a matter of constant observation, and cannot, like the rescues from death, be called into question. The statistics brought forward to prove that the treatment has not reduced the death-rate are also most faulty. Until it is thoroughly understood and in every instance properly applied it is manifestly foolish as well as unfair to lay non-success and failures at its door. When a medical man is called upon to treat a serious case, and instead of boldly addressing himself to the task of combating the symptoms by injecting the antidote irrespective of the quantity he may require until it has conquered the snake-poison, becomes nervous and ceases to inject, when, after what in ordinary practice would be a dangerous dose, he sees but little effect, or if from the first he injects small doses at long intervals, the cause of failure surely lies with him and not with the antidote, which rarely fails where it is properly applied. The duty of disseminating a sound knowledge of the principles of the strychnine treatment unquestionably devolves on our health authorities, who ought, by this time, to have taken some notice of it. But officialdom remains obtuse and issues circulars on the treatment of snakebite, recommending, _inter alia_, the free use of alcohol. The literature on the subject of snake-poison is very voluminous, but those who seek for enlightenment in it will be as disappointed as the writer was after wading through it. The toilers in this barren field of research were numerous, but with few exceptions, they toiled in vain. FONTANA may be looked upon as the founder of that hideous experimentalism by which, in his hands alone, four thousand animals were tortured to death without a single tangible result except that in his great work, ""Reserche Fisiche sopra il Veneno della Vipera,"" which he wrote at the conclusion of his cruel labours, he left us a grotesque monument of patient, but ill-guided research. Other Italians, following his method, Redi, Mangili, Metaxa, &c., were equally unsuccessful in shedding one ray of light on the vexed and obscure problem. Among the Germans who contributed to the subject may be mentioned:-- WAGNER.--""Erfahrungen Ã¼ber den Biss der gemeinen Otter."" PRINZ MAXIMILIAN VON WIEDD.--""BeitrÃ¤ge zur Geschichte Brasiliens."" LENZ.--""Schlangenkunde."" HEINZEL.--""Ueber Pelias Berus und Vipera Ammodytes."" Among the French:-- SOUBEIRAN.--""Rapport sur les VipÃ©res de France."" BULLET.--""Etude sur la Mosure de VipÃ©re."" British and American Workers are the most numerous. Commencing with the century we have:-- RUSSELL.--""An Account of Indian Serpents, collected on the Coast of Coromandel."" Later on, S. WEIR MITCHELL.--""Researches upon the Venom of the Rattlesnake."" HALFORD--""On Australian Snakes, and the Intravenous Injection of Ammonia, in _British Medical Journal_, _Medical Times_, and _Australian Medical Journal_."" JONES.--""On Trigonocephalus Contortrix."" NICHOLSON.--""On Indian Snakes."" SIR JOSEPH FAYRER.--""The Tanatophidia of India."" Also, ""Researches in conjunction with Richards, Brunton and Eward."" WALL.--""On the Difference in the Physiological Effects produced by the Poison of Indian Venomous Snakes."" Proc. Royal Soc., 1881, vol. xxxii., p. 333. Among those enumerated above Wall is the only one who formulated a correct and thoroughly scientific theory of the action of snake-poison, which has since been confirmed by Australian research and by Feoktistow's elaborate experiments. It is strange that, after finding the theory that explained all the phenomena, he did not follow it up by applying the antidote to which his theory should have led him. SNAKE-POISON AND ITS ACTION. The poison gland of snakes is the analogue of the parotid gland of mammals, both in position and structure. Its acini or alveoli are lined with a layer of secretory, columnar, finely granular cells and arranged with great regularity along the excretory duct, which is straight and cylindrical and opens with vipers into the hollow poison fang, with our colubrines into the groove on the anterior surface of it. Snake-poison, as it leaves this gland, is a thin, albuminoid, yellow liquid of neutral reaction. On exposure to the air it becomes viscid and slightly acid. Of its chemical composition we know as yet but little, and it is very questionable whether the most perfect chemical analysis of its constituents would ever have given us a clue to its action or will enrich our present knowledge of it. Like all albuminoid secreta it becomes putrid after prolonged exposure and then, through ammonia production, loses its acid, and assumes an alkaline reaction, still, however, though in a modified degree, retaining its toxic properties, which are completely lost only after an exposure of many months. Feoktistow found that freezing at 1Â° R. caused the poison to separate into a solid mass and a thin, very yellow liquid, which, even at a temperature of 4Â° R., remained liquid, and the poisonous properties of which greatly exceeded those of the solid mass. Boiling diminishes and, continued for any length of time, completely destroys the potency of the poison. The microscope has done good service in the investigation of snake-poison. It has, in the first place, informed us with absolute certainty that there are no micro-organisms or germs of any kind in the fresh poison immediately after it leaves the gland. But a still more important revelation we owe to it is the fact that these organisms, when we introduce them into a 2% solution of the poison, do not die, but live, multiply, and enjoy their existence most lustily, as they do in any other non-poisonous albuminoid liquid, whilst animals of a higher type--say a snail or a frog--soon perish in it. In watching the movements of the latter we find that they get slower and slower, and finally cease. We now follow up the interesting research, and take two frogs. Under the skin of one of them we inject a few drops of the poison solution, the other one for comparison we leave intact, and place both into a glass globe partly filled with water. In a very short time we have no difficulty to identify the poisoned frog. Its hind legs begin to drop and their movements become sluggish. This difficulty increases from minute to minute, until at last all motion ceases, and the legs hang down completely paralysed. At the same time we observe that the animal shows increasing difficulty of breathing, that, even when taken out of the water, and placed on the table before us it gasps for breath and is unable to move. At last respiration ceases altogether and the frog dies. Two problems now present themselves for solution. In the first place we have to account for the fact of the snake-poison leaving the lower forms of animal life intact and being fatal to the higher ones. The symptoms we have observed in the frog point unmistakably to an affection of the nervous system as their cause. Now we know that the lower forms which the poison does not affect have no such system, and we are justified to infer that to the absence of this system they owe their immunity. This inference leads us on to a second one equally justifiable, namely, that there is a certain unaccountable attraction between the delicate nerve tissue and the subtle ophidian poison, which renders the latter a specific nerve poison. Our second problem is to ascertain the nature of the change in the nerves, to find out, if possible, whether it is merely functional or an actual interference with the structure of either cells or fibres. With this end in view we once more consult the microscope. We make two preparations, one of nerve fibres and of nerve cells of the poisoned frog, and, under the microscope, compare them carefully with an analogous one from the killed healthy frog. The result is purely negative as regards structural change. Both present identical and perfectly normal pictures of apparently healthy cells and fibres. There being no visible structural change we are driven to the conclusion that only a functional one has been effected by the poison, and with the symptoms observed all pointing in that direction, that it is of central origin. The writer's theory as to the action of snake-poison, formed, in the first instance from observations made at the bedside of his patients only, is thus confirmed by experiments specially instituted by him for that purpose. Further proof of its correctness we have in the brilliant results of the strychnine treatment of snakebite in Australia, which is the outcome and practical application of this theory. In those desperate cases more especially, reported from all parts of the colonies, in which death was imminent, and pulse at wrists as well as respiration had already ceased, the strychnine injections could not possibly have effected complete recovery within a few hours if the structure of the nerve centres had been impaired or blood changes brought about incompatible with life. Feoktistow's experiments, made with viper poison, fully bear out the correctness of the writer's theory, besides proving that there is no essential difference between the action of the viperine and colubrine poisons. He proved conclusively that snake-poison does not destroy protoplasm or interfere with infusorial life, that injected into the heart of a mollusc it causes an almost immediate cessation of its action, that hypodermic injections of it in fish produce contraction of the pigment cells and bleaching of the integuments, followed by asphyxial respiration, general paralysis and death. Similar results were observed on frogs. In mammals the symptoms were: dyspnoea, asphyxia, paresis and paralysis of the lower extremities with succeeding general paralysis, sometimes tonic and clonic convulsions, hÃ¦morrhages from bowels, lungs, nose and bladder, and finally complete paralysis of respiration and of heart. Action of Snake-Poison on Special Nerve Centres. It must be borne in mind that the symptoms as about to be detailed are successive only to some extent in the order presented. They commence generally at the lower part of the spinal cord, but immediately afterwards, if not simultaneously, are ushered in with great rapidity from other centres, masking each other and rendering it extremely difficult to observe and analyse them separately. They are also very variable through the poison concentrating its action on special centres, leaving others comparatively intact, and this not only when from different varieties of snakes, but also from snakes of the same variety. Another element increasing the difficulties of correct analysis are the depressing effects of fear, inseparable in all but the strongest minds from the consciousness of having been bitten, and so similar in appearance to those of snake-poison, that sometimes it is by no means easy to decide which of the two is in operation, and that only those cases are of real value to the observer from which this element of fear is completely excluded. A.--Action on the Anterior Cornua of the Spinal Cord. The anterior cornua are almost invariably the first of the motor-centres attacked by the snake-poison, the affection (commencing with paresis and in serious cases generally culminating in paralysis) beginning in the lumbar ganglia and taking an upward course. The lower extremities feel unnaturally heavy and a paretic condition of the muscles supervenes _simultaneously on both sides_. The walk becomes unsteady and staggering, very similar to that of persons under the influence of large doses of alcohol. By a powerful effort of the will, however, persons in this condition are often able to walk and even run for some distance, especially if by prompt ligature the absorption of the poison has been checked. As the affection proceeds, though still able to move the legs in a sitting posture, they are unable to rise again. Ere long even sitting up becomes impossible and they collapse helplessly. At this stage sensation is still intact, and reflex action, by pricking the skin, &c., still takes place. The upper extremities generally retain the power of voluntary motion, even after the muscles of the neck have become paretic and the head is held up with difficulty or sinks to one side. With birds, according to Feoktistow, the reverse is the case. The wings are usually first attacked, or paresis comes on in wings and legs at the same time. B.--Action on the Medulla Oblongata. a.--The Vaso-Motor Centre. Whilst the voluntary muscles are thus brought under the influence of the poison, symptoms denoting the invasion of the oblongata are rapidly developing. The first of these is the deadly pallor and ashy hue of the cold skin, evidently due to the blood receding from the surface, a condition not unlike that obtaining in extreme anÃ¦mia. As persons in this state complain of an agonising feeling about the heart and of deadly faintness, a paretic condition of the heart suggests itself as the most obvious cause, more especially when taken in conjunction with the small, frequent, and compressible pulse. But though the heart muscle is no doubt participating in the general paresis, the condition of the surface of the body is in reality one of anÃ¦mia. The blood, even at this early stage, begins to accumulate in the large veins of the abdomen, which expand gradually in consequence of the diminishing motor force supplied by the splanchnicus, keeping them in the normal state of contraction when intact and having its centre in the medulla oblongata. When this large vaso-motor nerve is cut in animals anywhere in its course, the veins of the abdomen become distended enormously. The animal is, so to say, bled into its own belly. By a series of most interesting experiments Feoktistow has shown conclusively that snake-poison has the same effect on the abdominal circulation as section of the splanchnicus. Even slight intravenous injections of the poison produced quickly a high degree of paresis of the nerve and a corresponding engorgement of the veins of the abdomen, whilst after lethal doses, the paresis culminated in a few minutes in complete paralysis, followed by rapid collapse, excessive weakness of the bloodless heart, and death from paralysis of the latter and anÃ¦mia of the nerve-centres. One experiment deserves special record, as it also shows the untenability of the blood-poison theory. The whole vascular system of an animal poisoned by intravenous injection was thoroughly washed out with the warm defibrinised blood of four animals of the same species, the blood being infused into an external jugular vein and allowed to flow out of a crural artery. Although blood exceeding its normal quantity was left in the animal, when the vessels named were closed, the nerve affection remained unchanged. The blood pressure raised during the infusion sank at once again to zero, when it ceased, and the paralysed veins of the abdomen became engorged once more with the whole, or nearly the whole, of the blood-mass, leaving the rest of the body anÃ¦mic as before. This interesting experiment also shows how strong a hold the snake-poison has on the nerve-cells when they are thoroughly under its influence, and how independent this paralysing action is of the blood, persisting, as it was in this case, after all the poison had been washed out of the animal. The heart in vaso-motor paresis and paralysis is weakened in the first instance by the direct action of the poison on the medulla oblongata and the intracardiac ganglia. Its pulsations, at first retarded in frequency, become accelerated soon after the introduction of the poison, the pulse rate increasing rapidly and the waves becoming smaller and more easily compressible in proportion to the frequency of the pulse, which generally counts from 100 to 120 and more per minute at a comparatively early stage of the poisoning process. But an equally potent cause of heart failure is its depletion by the simultaneous stagnation of the blood mass in the veins of the abdomen. Finally, to complete the mischief, we have not only anÃ¦mia of the semi-paralytic oblongata, but the scanty blood supply this important centre receives becomes also surcharged with carbonic acid. OxyhÃ¦maglobin disappears almost entirely from the blood under the circumstances detailed, as both pulmonary and internal respiration are greatly interfered with, the blood tending more and more towards that thin dark condition which it presents after death, and which has been taken as _prima facie_ evidence of the direct blood-poisoning action of snake virus by one and all of previous investigators. That under the powerful combination of causes, each of which is in itself sufficient to endanger life, and greatly intensified as paresis gradually deepens into paralysis, the heart, even of large animals, succumbs in a comparatively short time, may be readily understood. The _blood-pressure_, under the circumstances just detailed, must necessarily be _nil_. Observations by means of the sphygmograph at the bedside of a person suffering from snake-poison are scarcely feasible, except, perhaps, in a hospital, and thus far are not on record. We must, therefore, once more fall back on Feoktistow's experiments, which show that even the smallest doses (0.02 to 0.04 mllgr.) of the dried poison _per kilo_ injected into the vein of a cat caused a fall in the blood-pressure almost immediately, without influencing either pulse or respiration, but that two to four mgr. were sufficient to reduce the blood-pressure to zero and bring on collapse, infusions of blood only raising it temporarily. Of drugs raising the blood-pressure he found ammonia the most effective, but only after slight doses of the poison; after lethal ones it had no effect whatever on the blood pressure but greatly increased the hÃ¦morrhagic process in all internal organs. This important observation should be kept in mind by those who inject ammonia in serious snakebite cases, and it probably applies likewise to _the excessive use of alcohol_. This leads the writer on to the discussion of this singular hÃ¦morrhagic process principally characteristic of viperine poisoning, and only very exceptionally produced by the poison of colubrines. It is among the symptoms of snakebite poisoning one of the most interesting ones, but also one most difficult of explanation. There can be no doubt that it is produced by vaso-motor paresis and paralysis. We further know that it is preceded by dilatation of the capillaries and small veins, and that it is effected principally through the process known as diapedesis, or the passage of both red and white corpuscles with plasma through the unruptured capillary membrane, and even the thin one of small veins, which is nearly of the same structure, being composed of endothelial cells united by cement. This membrane possesses a certain degree of porosity, which is probably increased by dilatation. In the absence of plain muscular fibres contraction and dilatation of the capillaries can only be effected by a corresponding contraction and expansion of the nuclei of the endothelial cells. As fibrils derived from non-medullated nerves terminate in small end-butts in connection with the capillary membrane, we may assume that the nuclei of the endothelial cells are under the sway of vaso-motor nerve currents, that weak ones will expand, strong ones contract them. We may further assume that the red and white corpuscles force their way out of the vessels through pores in the cement substance, since a passage of cell through cell is not thinkable. Thus far we see our way fairly clear. But the question now arises: what causes the solid constituents of the blood to force their way through the capillary membranes all over the mucous surfaces, even the conjunctiva, and not these alone, but also through serous membranes such as the pericardium, and strangest of all, through old scars in the skin? If the most modern ideas as to the cause of diapedesis being blood pressure are correct, it is quite incomprehensible how it can take place in the absence of blood pressure, and take place so extensively. The theory of blood pressure may apply to diapedesis accompanying the inflammatory process. In snakebite poisoning it is more likely to be due to passive engorgement of the capillary system and probably also to blockage of corpuscles in the finest capillary tubes. In vaso-motor paresis, and still more paralysis, the arterioles supplying the capillaries are widely dilated, and at the lowest blood pressure probably send more blood into the latter than in the normal state. This circumstance in itself is apt to cause capillary engorgement. In the finest capillaries permitting only a string of corpuscles, one behind the other but none abreast, to pass through in the normal state, dilatation may cause blockage by two or three becoming wedged in abreast and closing the lumen of the vessel by a sort of embolism. On the arterial side of this obstruction the crowded corpuscles force their way through the porous cement substance by what little ""vis a tergo"" there may be left yet, whilst in the venous side, in the small veins corresponding with the closed capillaries, engorgement must necessarily take place through this ""vis a tergo"" being entirely absent, and diapedesis, which here also has been observed, follow in due course. The writer has always been inclined to take this view, the correctness of which appears to be borne out by an experiment recorded by Feoktistow. He found on sprinkling a two per cent. solution of snake-poison over the mesentery of an healthy animal, that wherever a drop of the solution fell, almost immediately the capillaries and small veins became dilated and small point-like effusions of blood appeared, gradually enlarging and ultimately becoming confluent with adjoining ones. Large hÃ¦morrhagic surfaces were thus formed in a comparatively short time. Here paralysis of the nerve-cells interspersed in the vaso-motor nerve-ends was evidently the first effect, followed by dilatation of the capillaries and immediately afterwards by effusion. Without some obstruction within the capillaries, like that above described, effusion in this purely local poisoning process appears unexplainable. The special preference which the viper-poison has for the vaso-motor sphere will hereafter be referred to. HÃ¦morrhages from Australian snake-poison are comparatively rare. Even at the bitten place there is as a rule very little swelling and effusion and frequently none at all. When it occurs it quickly disappears after strychnine injections. Only a few cases have been reported as yet of blood-vomiting. In one of these the hÃ¦morrhage took place soon after the bite and was so considerable that it must have arisen from actual rupture of vessels consequent on abdominal engorgement and not from mere diapedesis. It is very doubtful whether the latter ever takes place here as it does after viper-bite in India and elsewhere. Even the death-adder, although half a viper, and producing more swelling and effusion locally than any other one of our snakes, is not known to have ever produced the extensive effusions from mucous surfaces in pericardium, lungs, &c., described above. More research however is necessary, especially more carefully conducted autopsies. Since Australia has taken the lead in this hitherto so obscure department, every practitioner should make it his object and special ambition to contribute his quota towards the elucidation of the subject, not only by reporting successful cases, but also the post-mortem appearances in unsuccessful ones, wherever it is practicable. It is not by experiments on animals but by a hearty co-operation of Australian practitioners that we can ever hope to supplement our knowledge on this subject. b.--The Respiratory Centre. Paresis of this centre does not play as important a part here as it does in India, more especially after cobra-bite. The peculiar, and as yet unexplained, tendency of snake-poison to act with special virulence on some centres, passing others by comparatively little disturbed, is markedly shown by the cobra poison of India as compared with that of our Australian cobra (_hoplocephalus curtus._) The unfortunate victims of the former are tortured by an ever-increasing dyspnoca, and finally die from asphyxia, under what are supposed to be carbonic acid convulsions. They retain their consciousness more or less unclouded to the last, the poison spending all its force on the respiratory centre, and leaving the brain intact. Here we hardly ever see actual dyspnoca after the bite of hoplocephalus or any other Australian snake. Respiration becomes quicker at an early stage, and then, from hour to hour, shallower; but our patients soon pass from sleep into coma, and suffer no respiratory distress even when, in consequence of general paralysis, the respiratory muscles cease to act, which usually takes place a few minutes before the heart stands still. Feoktistow records the following observations on cats with reference to the respiratory centre:--Small intravenous injections of the fresh poison (0.07-0.13 mllgr.) produced a great increase in frequency of respirations (280-360 per minute). Section of both vagi at once reduced this frequency, from which he infers that small doses act as an irritant to the respiratory centre. When small doses were repeated several times, the respiratory movements were gradually retarded, and asphyxia set in through paralysis of the centre. Large doses produced this effect at once, without any previous acceleration. Very large ones paralysed respiration, heart, and vaso-motors almost simultaneously, and caused the blood pressure to fall to 0. By the kymograph respirations were found to become shallower in proportion to their frequency. As the latter was reduced, they became at first deeper, but ere long shallower again, and were occasionally interrupted by spasmodic inspirations. Artificial respiration prolonged life for a short time only. C.--Action on Centres of Cranial Nerves. Among the symptoms denoting paresis of motor-centres of cranial nerves, together with sympathetic ganglia, the first and most noteworthy is the early dilatation of the pupil. This truly pathognomic condition is never absent, and becomes intense when paresis becomes intensified into paralysis. The most glaring light, in immediate proximity to the eyeball, has then no effect whatever on the pupil. If it remains dilated after strychnine injections have restored consciousness and the power to walk, it is a sure sign that the snake-poison is not completely counteracted, and will in all probability re-assert itself, necessitating another injection, whilst a pupil restored to its normal condition justifies the conclusion that the patient is safe. Another symptom denoting paresis of the cranial nerve-centres is a marked change in the expression of the face. The features become relaxed, and lose their mimetic play. The cornea is dull, and, together with the anterior surface of the eyeball, becomes dry, as the eyelids are moved imperfectly, if at all, and the tears in consequence are not properly distributed over the conjunctiva. The nostrils become more or less immovable, and the naso-labial fold is obliterated, whilst the lower lip hangs down. The lips are apart, as the lower jaw is not held up by the muscles. When paralysis supervenes it drops entirely, and the tongue protrudes. Deglutition, somewhat difficult in paresis, is completely suspended in the paralytic stage, through paralysis of the soft palate, the pharynx, and oesophagus. Liquids forced on the patient in this extremity may partly flow down the oesophagus, but will also enter the larynx, and their administration should be carefully avoided. D. Action on motor-centres of Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia. Of this action little if anything is patent to observation. A certain want of co-ordination in the movements has been noticed in the early stage of paresis, and the peculiar staggering walk of persons in this stage is probably owing to an affection of the motor-centres of the cerebellum. That they do not escape the action of the subtle poison, when symptoms denoting the invasion of all the other motor-centres throughout the body are in evidence, we have every reason to assume. The co-ordination and automatic regulation of the lower motor-centres must necessarily escape observation when the function of these centres is partially suspended, and when, moreover, the powerful currents of nerve force the cerebellum and basal ganglia receive from the motor cortical centres of the cerebrum are partially if not wholly withdrawn. E. Action of the Motor Cortical Centres of the Cerebrum. In all but the very lightest cases of snakebite-poisoning there are always symptoms manifested that cannot be referred to any other cause than an invasion of the centres now under consideration. They range from mere stupor, confusion of thought and delirium to the deepest coma, with complete extinction of consciousness and insensibility to all external impressions. Coma is a frequent and in serious cases an almost invariable symptom in Australia. After the bite of our death adder only we find persons sometimes collapse and expire suddenly, when still conscious and able to answer questions rationally. Coma invariably develops from sleep. It is, in fact, sleep intensified. An almost irresistible desire to sleep is one of the first symptoms to be observed. If the dose of poison imparted by the snake has been small, the desire may pass off or the sleep may not assume the form of coma, but in all serious cases it quickly assumes that form. _Vice versa_ the deepest coma becomes sleep again, when the suspended function of the cortical centres is roused by strychnine injections. The insensible and completely paralysed patient usually announces the gradual return of consciousness by a few groans and uneasy movements and not unfrequently begins to snore, as in ordinary sleep, when a smart shake at the shoulder will rouse him into full consciousness. At other times this transition from coma back to sleep does not take place and consciousness returns quite suddenly, the persons opening their eyes and looking around them, dazed and bewildered, but perfectly conscious at once. When coma is fully established and the largest and most powerful motor-centres have succumbed to the insidious poison, general paresis becomes general paralysis and all the motor-centres of the body are in a condition of more or less suspended functional activity. This and this only is the condition of the centres, the whole secret of snake-poison, that has puzzled the human mind for ages and yet appears so simple when discovered at last. It is beautifully and strikingly illustrated in the phenomena before us. We have coma and complete general paralysis, every motor-nerve cell, from the highest psycho-motor one downwards, is thrown into a state of torpor and has ceased to discharge the life force that regulates every process of life and the entire absence of which inevitably must be death. Only weak, lingering currents are sent forth yet and put off the inevitable finale for a time. But the strychnine is injected and mark the change. It courses quickly to every one of the sleepers, for whom it also has an affinity, but the direct opposite to that of the deadly venom that has overpowered them. It touches them as if with the wand of a magician and orders them to awake and do their work. There is no disobeying the mandate, for it is founded on one of nature's unchangeable laws. Almost immediately the cells begin their work again, the life streams flow afresh, coma and paralysis vanish and within a very short time the subject of this beautiful experiment is snatched from the brink of the grave and restored to life and health. The phenomena of sleep and coma as the result of a poison acting as a depressant of motor nerve force afford food for some interesting speculations, which, however, as more concerning the psychologist, the writer can only glance at here. It is evident that in the highest of psycho-motor centres, the organs of thought and of consciousness, the paresis of the lower centres assumes the form of sleep, and paralysis that of coma. Sleep, as a partial, and coma, as a complete, obliteration of thought and consciousness must, therefore, be intimately connected with motor nerve function, sleep being a reduction, coma a suppression of the function, or a suspension of thought. Ideation, to use J. S. Mill's very appropriate term for the thought process, appears to be effected by motor nerve currents or, at all events, to be accompanied by them and suspended with their suspension. The thinking principle, the nous within us, is no doubt more than mere nerve action, but it can, apparently, not manifest its presence without motor nerve cells in healthy action. Every thought, though not synonymous, is evidently synchronous with a current of motor nerve force, and it is not improbable that, by means of these currents, that silent transference of thought is effected from brain to brain, which modern psychology has demonstrated to be not only possible but actual under certain conditions. But further speculation on these interesting mysteries it would be out of place here to indulge in. F. Action on Sensory Centres and the Reflexes. The sensory sphere remains comparatively unaffected in mild cases, and in the early stages of more serious ones, but when paresis has deepened into paralysis, sensation becomes ever more blunted, and with the advent of coma, of course, quite extinct. Reflexes, both superficial and deep ones, are also completely abolished at this period of the poisoning process, and the nerves of special sense do not react against any, even the strongest possible stimulation. The eye stares vacantly into a glaring light held close before it, and the widely dilated pupil shows no sign of reaction. The ear also appears deaf to any noise, and strong ammonia vapour is inhaled through the nose like the purest air, whilst pricking, beating, and even burning the skin elicit not a quiver of a muscle. Feoktistow's experiments with regard to reflexes, more especially their restoration by strychnine, differ in their results entirely from Australian observations. Whilst we have no difficulty in restoring them with the drug on man as well as the domestic animals, his experiments on frogs were a failure, and merely showed a decided antagonism between the two poisons. He did not succeed in restoring the reflexes, and, instead of following up with experiments on the higher animals, he trusted implicitly to his results on frogs, and thus lost his opportunity. G. Irregularities in the Action of Snake-poison. There is in the whole range of toxicology not a single condition known to us in which the symptoms, both in chronological order and in their strength and relation to each other, show as much variety as those of snake-poison. Experienced observers will agree with the writer that it is but rarely we find two cases of snakebite exactly alike in the symptoms they present. Some of these puzzling variations have already been alluded to, but it is necessary to consider them a little more in detail. Apart from quantitative differences in the poison imparted, they arise principally from the strange capriciousness with which the poison concentrates its action on special nerve centres and leaves others comparatively intact. The nearest approach to regularity and orderly sequence of the symptoms, as described in the foregoing pages, we find in Australia after the bite of the tiger snake (_Hoplocephalus curtus_) and the brown snake (_Diemenia superciliosa_), more especially that of Queensland. Here we can trace the action of the poison distinctly from centre to centre, from the lowest part of the anterior cornua up to the cortex cerebri, and even throughout the sympathetic ganglia as far as they are patent to observation. The poison of these snakes is extremely diffusible and quickly absorbed. It spreads with rapidity and nearly equal force over all the motor centres, the symptoms following each other so quickly as almost to appear simultaneous, though, in reality, successive. But even the poison of these snakes leaves the arms only slightly paretic, when paralysis in all the other voluntary muscles is well pronounced, and does not paralyse them until coma has set in. It also touches the respiratory centre but slightly. Sometimes coma is light and the patients can be roused for a little while, at other times it is deep and lasts till death. But even greater variations are observed occasionally. In one very extraordinary case of tiger snakebite, the patient, a child of 9 years, remained conscious to the last, and after vomiting blood freely died under symptoms of heart failure. In rare cases the symptoms resemble those of cobra poison. If we turn from these to the black snake (_Pseudechis porphyriacus_) a different picture presents itself. Its poison does not produce so deep a coma and often none at all. The patients generally feel drowsy and fall asleep, but are easily roused and sometimes awake spontaneously. There is also not the same amount of muscular paralysis. They are frequently able to walk a few steps with assistance and can move in bed, the arms especially being almost free from paresis. But the insidious poison none the less does its work, though its effects are less patent. It concentrates its action on the vaso-motor centre. The victims from hour to hour become more anÃ¦mic in appearance through increasing engorgement of the abdominal veins. AnÃ¦mia of the nerve-centres hastens the collapse, and from the combined effects of this and heart failure death takes place suddenly and quickly as if in a fainting fit. Here then we have an approach to the effects of viper poison which is also shown in the greater amount of swelling and effusion around the bite and in the bitten limb. This approach is still closer in the poison of the death adder (_Acantophis antarctica_). There is generally much extravasation of blood locally. Muscular paralysis is also less pronounced, but sudden collapse from vaso-motor paralysis not unfrequently takes place, when the patients fully conscious are still able to sit up. That leading feature of viper poison, diapedesis with hÃ¦morrhage, does not occur with either. If we turn from Australian to Indian snakes, the peculiar tendency of the poison to concentrate its action on special nerve-centres becomes still more marked. The predilection of the cobra poison for the respiratory centre has already been dwelt on. More remarkable and strange is the action of the Indian viper-poison on the minute ganglia in the vaso-motor nerve ends, which control the capillary circulation, and by their paralysis bring about extensive hÃ¦morrhage through diapedesis. It is quite impossible for us with our present scanty knowledge to account for these peculiarities and irregularities in the action of a poison, which we know now to accomplish its destruction of animal life by one uniform design and principle of action. That the protean forms under which the poison-symptoms present themselves are one and all the result of reduction and suspension of motor nerve currents may now be accepted as a well proven and fully established scientific fact. But why the effects of one and the same cause are so varying in their appearance, why the poison of different varieties of snakes, and even that of the same variety under different circumstances, make such a capricious selection among the various motor nerve-centres we can not explain and probably never will. Chemical analysis of the dead poison, no matter how minutely and elaborately it may be effected, will probably never throw much light on the ""why"" of this strange puzzle, for the subtle phenomena of life are apt to elude the grasp of the analyst. We have to do with a poison transferred from one living organism into another one and modified in its action by the condition of the giver and the constitution and peculiarities of the recipient quite as much probably as by slight variations in its chemical composition. Accepting the ""why"" of these phenomena like that of many other ones, simply as a fact not to be accounted for at present, we must be content to know ""how"" they are effected, and, what is of more immediate and paramount importance to know, that we now have an antidote that will deal successfully with them all, that the convulsions and hÃ¦morrhages of the Indian viper-poison and the asphyxia of that of the cobra will yield as readily to strychnine, when properly and boldly applied, as the coma and general paralysis following the bite of the deadly tiger snake. [Illustration] THE ANTIDOTE. The theory of the action of snake-poison as that of a specific nerve-poison, depressing and more or less suspending the function of the motor nerve-centres throughout the body, has in the foregoing pages received a double proof of its correctness. In the first place, all the symptoms the snake-poison produces have been passed in review, and shown to be fully explainable by this theory. On this ground alone it may be claimed to have been fully established; for it is an axiom in science that a theory on any subject must be accepted as correct, if it accounts satisfactorily for all the phenomena observable in connection with that subject by showing them to result from the operation of one law. The second inductive proof of the correctness of the writer's theory has been rendered by the experiments of Feoktistow on animals. Science, however, demands that a theory thus established inductively must also stand the test of practical application or deduction. It says in the present case:--""Granting your theory to be correct, it is but a theory, which, however valuable it may be as a contribution to science, is of little value to mankind if you cannot apply it practically. If snake-poison merely acts as a depressant on motor nerve-cells without interfering with their structure, you must be able to counteract it by administering some drug or substance which acts as a powerful stimulant on these cells, if such a substance can be found."" It is another illustration of that wise adaptation of means to ends which, throughout the domain of nature, denotes the presence and rule of a Supreme Intelligence, that this substance has been provided for us by nature, though we have been long in finding it. Its discovery in strychnine, and its successful application as the long and vainly sought antidote to snake-poison, are glorious triumphs of scientific deduction. Strychnine is the exact antithesis to snake-poison in its action. Under its influence every motor nerve-cell throughout the system sends forth stronger currents of nerve force than it does in its normal state. These currents run alike from cell to cell, and from cell to peripheral fibre, and act by means of the latter on all contractile, and especially all muscular tissue, causing contractions, which, after poisonous doses of the drug, assume the form of tetanic convulsions, provoked by the slightest touch or even noise in consequence of highly intensified reflex action. Whilst, then, snake-poison, as we have seen, turns off the motor-batteries and reduces the volume and force of motor-nerve currents, strychnine, when following it as an antidote, turns them on again, acting with the unerring certainty of a chemical test, _if administered in sufficient quantity_. Purely physiological in its action, it neutralises the effects of the snake-poison, and announces, by unmistakable symptoms, when it has accomplished this task, and would, if continued, become a poison itself. Previous to this announcement its poisonous action is completely neutralised by the snake-poison, and the latter would therefore be equally as efficacious in strychnine-poisoning as strychnine is in snake-poisoning. Strychnine, in short, is the antidote _par excellence_ of snake-poison, and cannot be surpassed by any other substance known to us. With the symptoms following the introduction of the subtle ophidian virus into the human and animal system so markedly pointing to strychnine as the antidote, it appears a matter of surprise that it was not used as such before and that it was left to the writer to discover the antagonism between the two poisons. Misleading experiments with the drug on animals erroneously considered to be final in their results, together with confused and contradictory notions about the action of snake-poison, were the chief factors, already pointed out, that caused research on this important subject to remain for centuries so barren of results, and made even able investigators with more correct views than the rest, postpone the discovery of a physiological antidote to a more advanced state of science, when all the time it was lying ready at their hands. It is self-evident from preceding statements, that in the treatment of snakebite with strychnine the ordinary doses must be greatly exceeded, and that its administration must be continued, even if the total quantity injected within an hour or two amounts to what in the absence of snake-poison would be a dangerous if not a fatal dose. Timidity in handling the drug is fraught with far more danger than a bold and fearless use of it. The few failures among its numerous successes recorded during the last four years in Australia were nearly all traceable to the antidote not having been injected in sufficient quantity. Even slight tetanic convulsions, which were noticed in a few cases, invariably passed off quickly. It should be borne in mind that of the two poisons warring with each other that of the snake is by far the most insidious and dangerous one, more especially in its effects on the vaso-motor centres. The latter are wrought very insidiously, and where they predominate require the most energetic use of the antidote, for whilst the timid practitioner after injecting as much strychnine as he deems safe stands idly by waiting for its effects, the snake virus, not checked by a sufficient quantity of it, continues its baneful work, drawing the blood mass into the paralysed abdominal veins and finally by arrested heart action bringing on sudden collapse. In such cases even some tetanic convulsions are of little danger and may actually be necessary to overcome the paralysis of the splanchnicus and with it that of the other vaso-motor centres. Whilst then it must be laid down as a principle that the antidote should be administered freely and without regard to the quantity that may be required to develop symptoms of its own physiological action, the doses in which it is injected and the intervals between them must be left to the practitioner's judgment, as they depend in every case on the quantity of snake-poison absorbed, the time elapsed since its inception and the corresponding greater or lesser urgency of the symptoms. If the latter denote a large dose to have been imparted and it has been in the system for hours, delay is dangerous and nothing less than 16 minims of liq. strychnine P.B., in very urgent cases even 20 to 25 minims should be injected to any person over 15 years of age. Even children may require these large doses, as they are determined by the quantity of the poison they have to counteract and are kept in check by it. The action of the antidote is so prompt and decisive that not more than 15 to 20 minutes need to elapse, after the first injection, before further measures can be decided on. If the poisoning symptoms show no abatement by that time, a second injection of the same strength should be made promptly, and unless after it a decided improvement is perceptible, a third one after the same interval. As the action of strychnine when applied as antidote is not cumulative, no fear needs to be entertained of violent effects suddenly breaking out after these large doses repeated at short intervals. They are, so to say, swallowed up by the snake-poison and remain latent except in counteracting the latter. This has now been proven abundantly by scores of qualified observers in all parts of Australia, and still more by Banerjee in India. No hesitation, therefore, should be felt by medical men in other snake-infested countries to adopt the Australian treatment. It is seldom that more than half a grain of strychnine administered in 16m. doses of liq. strychniÃ¦ is required here to effectually counteract the venom and place its intended victim out of danger. Ligature and excision of the bitten skin have usually been practised and much of the poison eliminated before the antidote is applied. Our snakes, however, as already pointed out, with their shorter and merely grooved fangs, do not perforate the cellular tissue to such depth nor instil as large a quantity of poison as the cobras, kraits and vipers of India or the rattlesnake of America, all having perforated and much longer fangs and much more productive poison glands. Even if after the bite of a vigorous cobra, for instance, a ligature has been applied and the bitten part deeply excised, a comparatively large quantity of poison will probably be absorbed requiring much larger quantities of the antidote, perhaps grains of it, to effect a cure. If under the influence of these large doses the symptoms abate, or if the latter are comparatively mild from the first, smaller doses of strychnine should be injected, say from 1/15th to 1/10th of a grain, but under all circumstances the rule that, distinct strychnia symptoms must be produced before the injections are discontinued, should never be departed from. This rule is a perfectly safe one, for its observance entails no danger, a few muscular spasms or even slight tetanic convulsions being easily subdued and harmless as compared with that most insidious condition exemplified in case No. 1, cited below, the first one treated with strychnine by the writer, who, having no experience in the treatment, did not administer quite enough strychnine. The patient, after apparently recovering from a moribund condition and being able to walk and even to mount a horse, remained partly under the influence of the poison and succumbed to it during sleep, when, according to subsequent experience, one more injection would have saved him. The tendency to relapses is always great when much snake-poison has been absorbed. Apparently yielding to the antidote for a time, the insidious venom, after a shorter or longer interval, during which it appears to have been conquered, all at once re-asserts its presence, and has to be met by such fresh injections, regardless of the quantity of strychnine previously administered, but the amount required in most relapses is not a large one. The writer formerly inclined to the belief that the strain thus put on the delicate nerve-cells would limit the usefulness of the antidote to cases requiring not much above a grain. Knowing the Indian snakes to impart to their victims such comparatively large quantities of venom, he had strong misgivings as to his method standing the severe test of Indian practice; and it was most fortunate for this method that its first practical application in India was made by a gentleman who, whilst thoroughly familiar with its principles and convinced of their correctness, had the courage to apply them fearlessly by injecting what to us Australians appear enormous quantities, ranging as they do up to three and four grains per patient. Dr. Banerjee's eight cases, all successful, and of which the most important one, relating to the much and justly dreaded Duboia Russellii, was published in the November number of the _Australasian Medical Gazette_, settled the treatment of snakebite in India as well as elsewhere. If the poison of Bungarus coeruleus, Echis carinata, and Duboia Russellii can be successfully counteracted, and if for this purpose four grains of strychnine can be injected with perfect impunity, it may be inferred with certainty that the poison of the cobra, fer-de-lance, and the rattlesnake--in fact, of any snake known to us will be found amenable to the antidote, and that, if four grains can be injected with safety, we may venture on six and eight grains, if they are required. In those cases only where the long fangs of these snakes perforate into a vein, and a large quantity of the venom injected into the blood-stream overpowers the nerve-centres so as to make death imminent, if not almost instantaneous, the subcutaneous injections may be found of little use. Here intravenous injections of half a grain and even one grain doses would appear to be indicated, and might yet fan the flame of life afresh, even when respiration and pulse at wrist have already ceased. We have seen both these functions extinct in Australia and restored by comparatively small doses of the antidote, and can see no reason why a more energetic use of it should not restore them in India. Considering the terrible mortality from snakebite in India, Dr. Banerjee's merit in being the first to introduce the strychnine treatment there is of a very high order, and his grateful countrymen will ever cherish his memory. When his Excellency the Viceroy had been appealed to in vain by the writer, and the adoption of his method in India urged through two Australian Governors, a native of India has stepped forward and taken the first step towards alleviating an evil that has hurried over two millions of his countrymen in every century to an untimely grave. The cases as reported by him to the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ are cited below. [Illustration] CASES. If the deductions and conclusions set forth in the foregoing chapters are correct, it may be justly contended that all cases of snakebite treated with strychnine should invariably end in recovery if the antidote is properly applied, according to the rules above detailed. This contention the writer fully and cordially endorses. Given the largest amount of poison a snake can give off at one bite, strychnine injected in time and sufficient quantity--either by the hypodermic, or, if urgent, by the intravenous method--must rouse the dormant nerve-cells into action, as long as the vital functions are not completely extinct. Wherever it fails, the fault lies with the operator not injecting it in sufficient quantity--a fault committed by the writer himself in his first case. The following condensed accounts of fifty cases treated in Australia, and eight in India, the writer has taken mostly from the _Australasian Medical Gazette_. Two of these only are from his own practice; others were kindly communicated to him by his colleagues. It is not claimed that all these cases were rescues from certain death. Some of them undoubtedly were, others would have recovered under some other treatment or no treatment at all; but in none of them would recovery have been so rapid and complete. The two poisons are thrown out together, and no ill-effects of either are experienced beyond a certain degree of weakness, which passes off quickly. This is a boon to be appreciated fully by those only who have gone through the slow, lingering, and painful process of convalescence from snakebite as formerly treated, with its deadly languor and weariness, making life itself a burden and all physical and mental exertion impossible. CASE 1.--A. H., 15 years old, a farm labourer, was bitten on the right index finger whilst feeling for a rabbit in a burrow. Did not see the snake nor suspect snakebite, but collapsed helplessly in a few minutes after returning to his work. The writer saw him three hours after the accident. He was then completely paralysed and in deep coma; pupils widely dilated and not reacting to light; sense of sight and hearing dead; heart action extremely feeble; pulse small, thread-like, and scarcely countable; respiration quick and shallow; skin blanched and very cold. Seeing him dragged along the road between two men, had him quickly carried to the next house, and injected 20 minims of liq. strychnine. Only a groan or two and a slight improvement in the pulse, indicating a change in his condition, gave him a second injection about twenty minutes after the first one. A change for the better then became rapidly conspicuous. The pulse gained in strength from minute to minute, respiration became deeper, and the coma was visibly reduced to mere sleep, from which there was no difficulty in rousing him to full consciousness by a vigorous shake of the shoulders. This marvellous change was brought about within forty minutes; and this being the first case to which the writer had applied his theory by injecting strychnine, its unparalleled success exceeded his most sanguine expectations, but unfortunately also lulled him into a false sense of security, which proved disastrous to his patient. Not knowing then as he does now that the snake-poison after having been subdued by the antidote is not thrown out of the system as quickly as the strychnine, and is therefore apt to re-assert itself, he allowed another urgent engagement to take him away from the lad after watching him for two hours and actually taking the evening tea with him. His instructions to the mother not to let her son go to sleep and to watch him carefully for the slightest sign of the return of symptoms, were unfortunately disobeyed. Both mother and son went to sleep, deeming all danger over. During this sleep the lad again relapsed into coma and was found so at daylight. All attempts to rouse him were fruitless, and he died before the messenger intended for me had time to saddle a horse. The death of the unfortunate lad, however, has saved some lives since. It taught the writer the lesson never to trust to the apparent success of the antidote until it shows distinct signs of its own physiological action, and even then to watch his patients carefully for the first twenty-four hours, and let them sleep for short periods only. CASE 2.--A.H., a vigorous girl of 20 years, bitten above the left ankle by a snake in some long grass, and therefore not identified. Had applied two tight ligatures above the bite, ran home and got her mother to cut out the bitten skin, showing two distinct punctures. Seen within an hour after the bite the girl presented distinct, but moderate symptoms, deadly paleness, very cold skin, small frequent pulse, and a peculiar feeling of agony about the heart, just able to sit upright, but unable to walk. All symptoms increased rapidly after writer cut ligatures. She reeled from side to side, and suddenly fell forward as if in a swoon. Injected 1/6th grain of strychnine and, as she did not lose consciousness, was able to watch the interesting and rapid effect of the antidote. It had not been injected more than five minutes when slight colour returned to the cheeks, naturally very red. Patient then stated that the distressing feeling about the heart was getting less and also that of drowsiness. From minute to minute her condition improved, and in about ten she was able to rise and walk a few steps. Profiting, however, by the lesson his first case had given him, the writer did not trust to her apparent recovery, but seeing that much of the poison had been eliminated by the prompt measures taken before he saw her, he injected only 1/12th of a grain, which produced slight muscular spasms. Careful precautions were taken in this case against a relapse, but none took place, and when visited next morning the girl declared herself as well as ever she had been in her life. The following notes of two cases of tiger snake bite (_Hoplocephalus curtus_), treated with strychnine, were read by Dr. Thwaites before the Intercolonial Medical Congress of 1889. This gentleman, a young practitioner just entering practice, had the courage to use the antidote according to the writer's directions in spite of the hostile criticisms of his seniors in the profession and even his own university teachers, and thereby not only saved two valuable lives, but also set a praiseworthy example, which was soon followed by others. The writer gives the notes abbreviated. CASE 3.--J. B., a strong, robust labourer, bitten by a tiger snake on the back of right hand. Killed the snake, which hung on to the hand and was with some difficulty shaken off. Made slight incision through the punctures and tied a rag round the wrist, but too loosely to check circulation; then started for the next neighbour's house, distant a mile, which he reached with difficulty, staggering like a drunken man when he arrived. The bitten skin was here excised, whisky administered and patient sent on in a buggy, but distance being 30 miles to Dr. Thwaites' residence, a messenger on horseback galloped ahead to get Dr. Thwaites to meet buggy on road. The latter writes: ""I met buggy four miles from my residence. Patient had to be held up on the seat of the vehicle between two men. He had not spoken for some time, pulse very weak, pupils greatly dilated, face very pale. I injected 10 minims of liq. strychnine P.B. at once, and in a few minutes noticed some improvement. He now answered when spoken to, his pulse became stronger, and he could walk a few steps. This was at 5.30 p.m., and he kept up fairly well till 8.15, when he collapsed completely. I now injected 20 minims of liq. strychniÃ¦, which in a short time brought him round; but at 9.15 another relapse took place, when a third injection of 15 m. was made. This was followed by slight twitching about the face and neck, after which improvement and recovery were uninterrupted."" Dr. Thwaites' second case is even more remarkable and telling. When the girl, after a journey of 30 miles, was carried into his surgery, she appeared to be dead, and a second medical man, who happened to be present, declared her to be so, and all attempts to revive her useless. CASE 4.--A. D., aged 15 years, a schoolgirl, bitten by a vigorous tiger-snake on the outside of left leg, the snake also holding on for some time. She at once tightened her garter above the knee and ran home, a distance of three-quarters of a mile. The bitten skin was at once excised, another firm ligature applied, whisky administered, and a hurried start made for Dr. Thwaites', distant 30 miles, where she arrived five hours after accident. The latter writes:--""She was then pulseless at wrists, cold as a stone, and with pupils insensible to light. I could not perceive any respiration, but felt the heart yet faintly fluttering. She was to all appearances just on the point of death. I injected at once 17 minims of liq. strychniÃ¦. In about two minutes she sighed, and then began to breathe in a jerky manner. In about ten minutes, on my pulling her hair, she opened her eyes and looked around, but could not recognise any one. Pupils now acted to stimulus of light. In a short time she could speak when spoken to, but not see at any distance. Her sight gradually returned completely; she kept on improving, and in four to five hours after the one injection she seemed quite well, but rather weak. I gave small doses of stimulants till morning, and did not let her go to sleep till next evening. She suffered no relapse, and her recovery was complete."" CASE 5.--This remarkable case was not published in the medical press, but in many of the papers of Queensland, where it created much sensation. The writer is indebted for an account of it to Dr. Thwaites, who vouches for its correctness. It appears that this gentleman acquainted the well-known explorer of Northern Queensland, Mr. Johnstone, who is his uncle, and now police magistrate at Maryborough, Queensland, with his success in treating snakebite with strychnine. Mr. Johnstone, who during his explorations had seen much of snakebite and many deaths from it, wrote rather incredulously in reply, stating that our southern snakes were innocuous in comparison with those of the north; and that, having seen twelve persons bitten and die by the deadly brown snake of the north (_Diemenia superciliosa_), he must withhold his belief in the new antidote until he had witnessed a case of brown snakebite cured by it or reported on good authority. This desire he had quickly gratified, and by a strange fatality in his own person. Whilst taking his children for a walk in the bush a few weeks afterwards he stepped aside the path to pluck a flower from a bush, and in doing so was bitten on the leg by a vigorous brown snake. He at once applied a ligature, and had the punctures sucked by an aboriginal, but became comatose before he reached home. Three medical men were summoned in haste, injected ammonia into several veins, and finally had to resort to artificial respiration, declaring the case a hopeless one. In this extremity Mrs Johnstone rushed to a fourth one, who had seen Dr. Thwaites' letter, and discussed its contents with her husband in her presence. This gentleman--Dr. Garde--laid up in bed, quickly furnished the lady with liq. strychniÃ¦, accompanied by the request to his colleagues to inject it freely. She came back to her husband's bedside, when artificial respiration was about to be given up, but the very first injection rendered it no longer necessary and two more restored Mr. Johnstone completely. Saving the life of this highly respected and popular functionary, who was the first in Queensland treated with the antidote, paved the way for it in that colony, where it is most needed and is now highly appreciated. These five cases, thoroughly typical of the effects of strychnine in snakebite, are almost in themselves sufficient to bear out the correctness of the writer's deductions, but for the benefit of a certain class of rigorously incredulous scientists, who would not be satisfied with five cases, the writer submits 45 more and in addition to these--last but not least--Dr. Bannerjee's eight Indian cases. They are all well authenticated, being mostly taken from the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ or from private notes, but to avoid useless repetition the greater part of them will be merely cited and only the more remarkable ones be given in detail. Whether in the face of this formidable array of evidence that blind incredulity and senseless opposition, usually blocking the way of every new discovery, will at last give way, remains to be seen. The writer has had his full share of them, and but for the valuable aid he received from the Hon. Dr. Creed, the able editor of the _A. M. Gazette_, would probably be struggling yet for the introduction of his antidote. When it is considered that, in spite of such evidence as here produced, his discovery has as yet received no official recognition from any of the Australian medical authorities, and that even now there are medical men who can write such effusions as that of Dr. T. L. Bancroft, of Brisbane, beginning with the words: ""It is deplorable to still see recorded cases of snakebite treated with strychnine, &c.,"" (see _Gazette_ for July, 1892)--the attitude assumed from the first by Dr. Creed and his unfailing advocacy of the antidote can not be too highly appreciated and lay both the writer and the public under a debt of deep gratitude to him. But for his early recognition of the soundness of the writer's theory and treatment of snakebite many valuable lives now saved would have been lost. As early as June, 1889, Dr. Creed wrote in an editorial: ""We desire to call the special attention of the profession to Dr. Mueller's papers on the pathology and cure of snakebite, published in our issues for Nov., Dec., Feb, April and May last, and to press upon them the justice and, we submit, the necessity of extremely careful consideration of his theory and of the results shown in the cases in which, acting on it, he has used hypodermic injections of strychnine for the treatment of snakebite. We formerly expressed our concurrence in the opinion of Sir Joseph Fayrer, who wrote: 'I do not say that a physiological antidote is impossible, all I assert is, that it is not yet found.' We are indeed pleased to state that we believe such an antidote is now found and that Dr. Mueller is the happy discoverer. We are of opinion that his theory as to the pathological changes set up in the human system by the injection of snake-poison is a sound one and that the treatment he has suggested and used is correct and proper, and the one likely to avert death in cases of snakebite, which would otherwise in all probability prove fatal. We therefore press the use of hypodermic injections of strychnia in the manner described by him upon the attention of practitioners who may have to treat cases in which the symptoms present are the result of snake or dangerous insect poison, and think that, should the patients die without its having been used, all will not have been done to save life that might have been."" Without such utterances repeated from time to time and without the ample space always allowed in the _Gazette_ to the subject, a record like that now submitted would not have been possible. CASE 6.--P. Evans, a girl of 20 years, bitten on wrist by a brown snake. Symptoms--Staggering gait, drowsiness, &c. Only 1/16th grain in four injections. Notes furnished by Drs. Mahoney and Kennedy, of Albury. CASE 7.--W. Thiplin, a labourer, bitten on hand by brown snake. Three injections. Notes by Dr. Baird of Healesville. CASE 8.--Luke Dewhurst, labourer, bitten on hand by tiger snake. Cured by one injection of m. xv. liq. strychniÃ¦ after ammonia had failed. Notes by Dr. Dutton, of Lillydale. CASE 9.--P. Moroney, labourer, bitten on thigh at night, snake not identified. Cured by three injections of 1/12th grain each. Notes by Dr. Pardey, of Myrtleford. CASE 10.--Mrs. Skinner, bitten on thigh, at Carrum. Treated by Dr. Verity. CASE 11.--Child of Mr. Weeks, aged three years. Treated by Dr. Degner, of Myrtleford. CASE 12.--Annie Rankin, servant, at Corowa. Treated by local chemist. CASE 13.--Child of Mr. F. Daniels, of Mount Kent, Queensland, _only two years old_, bitten by a death adder on fourth finger of left hand, the snake found clinging to finger. Ligature applied and finger chopped off, but condition of child very precarious when admitted to Toowoomba Hospital, after a night's journey, at daylight, in complete collapse. Pronounced out of danger by Dr. Hunt, the house-surgeon, at 10.30 and taken home in the afternoon. Notes not furnished. CASE 14.--Reported by Dr. Pain, of Allora, Queensland. Symptoms serious. Four injections of m. xv., x., viii. and vii. CASE 15.--Reported by Dr. Garde, of Maryborough, Queensland, girl of 13 years, bitten by brown snake, requiring only two injections of m. xv. and x. CASE 16.--Reported by Dr. St. George Queely, of Maytown, Queensland, lad of 19 years, bitten by black snake, symptoms serious. Four injections of m. xv., xv., xx., and xv., total 65 minims of liq. strych. P.B. injected within less than two hours, muscular spasms appearing after last injection. Patient made rapid recovery, riding home, a distance of 16 miles, within a few hours after treatment. CASE 17.--Reported by Dr. Ray, of Seymour, severe bite of a tiger snake. Within six hours 4/5th of a grain administered subcutaneously, besides a considerable quantity given by the mouth. Patient made a good recovery. ""Every injection after the second one,"" Dr. Ray reports, ""having a distinct effect within three or four minutes, and lasting from one to one and a half hours before tendency to coma returned."" CASE 18.--Very remarkable. Read by Dr. Forbes, medical officer of hospital, Charters Towers, Queensland, before the North Queensland Medical Society. Boy, 6 years old, was admitted to hospital at 9 p.m. on 27th October, 1890, bitten on foot by a death adder, which was killed and identified. Dr. Forbes reports: When seen by me, two hours after the accident, he was sitting on his mother's knee with his head hanging on one side, but quite conscious, and answering questions rationally, pupils widely dilated with almost no reaction to light, pulse very fast and soft, &c. Thinking his condition might be due to fear I hesitated to use strychnine. So, ordering strong coffee, I hurried to attend an accident case just admitted with severe hÃ¦morrhage, and left the boy in charge of a nurse, with orders to call me at once if she saw any change. I had scarcely been away 15 minutes when the father rushed in saying his boy was dead, and indeed his statement seemed but too true. The child was lying quite limp, face blue, eyes half shut, extremities very cold, no pulse perceptible, no respiration visible. I at once injected m. x. of liq. strychniÃ¦ P.B. and made artificial respiration. He soon began to improve, and in about 20 minutes was able to speak. He was watched all night, but suffered no relapse, and was discharged on the next day. CASES 19 TO 21, reported by Dr. Weekes, of Lithgow, N.S.W. Dr. Weekes writes:--""Within the last year I have had three cases under my care, all bitten by black snakes, and all in about the same place, on the outside of the calf of the leg. The patients were all comatose, exhibiting all the usual symptoms of snakebite-poisoning, and in one, my last case, _the patient had convulsions_. In all of them I made hypodermic injections of m. xv. liq. strych., and the effects were most marked, the patients being completely roused and becoming quite sensible and rational each time,"" &c. CASE 22.--Mrs. Ryan, of Oberon, N.S.W., bitten on leg by tiger snake, comatose and nearly pulseless after three hours, treated by Dr. Kingsburry, amount of strychnine not stated. CASE 23.--Benjamin Childs, bitten on finger by death adder, treated by Dr. Campbell, of Grafton, N.S.W. CASE 24.--Rather remarkable. Reported by Dr. Lloyd Parry, of Emmaville, N.S.W., in _Gazette_ of March, 1891, and further particulars in private correspondence with writer. A Chinese miner, aged 30 years, was bitten on the back of the foot by a death adder. His mates, deeming medical aid useless, did not send for Dr. Parry until death was imminent, and then only with a view of getting a certificate of death, and avoiding autopsy and inquest. When seen, three hours after infliction of bite, the man was deeply comatose and pulseless, skin icy cold, pupils dilated and insensible to light, lower jaw hanging down and tongue protruding, respiration scarcely perceptible. He was in fact so near death that this event was expected to take place from minute to minute. In order to task the antidote to the utmost, Dr. Parry cut the tight ligature without excising the bitten skin and then injected xv. of liq. st. P.B. To his surprise in a few minutes the man began to groan and very soon afterwards became conscious. Dr. Parry then watched him carefully and in about an hour found coma returning, when another injection was made and roused him for good. There was much swelling and effusion in the leg, but no ill effects followed. In this case, judging from the comparatively small quantity of the antidote required, only a small amount of poison had been imparted, the bite being on the back of the foot, where the fangs cannot penetrate deeply. Still there can be no doubt that even this small quantity of the justly dreaded death adder poison would have proved fatal, if it had not been counteracted by the antidote. CASE 25, reported from Tasmania by Dr. Holmes, of Launceston, presents different features, showing the very large quantity of the antidote sometimes required. After describing the condition of his patient, a Mrs. Frazer, of St. Leonards, Dr. Holmes writes:--""From her desperate condition I thought it too late for the ammonia treatment and decided on injecting liq. strychniÃ¦. At 12.30 p.m. injected m. xv, at 1.40, m. xv., at 2.10, m. xv., at 2.40, m. xv., and 3.10, m. xv., at 4 p.m., m. x., and at 5, m. x. A few minutes after the last dose I noticed the physiological action of the drug and desisted from injecting. At 8 p.m. she seemed almost well, pupils normal in size and reacting well, was not sleepy and could swallow easily. The patient made a good recovery."" This is the largest quantity of strychnine that has been required in Australia, namely, 126 minims of liq. strych., or 1-1/9th gr. injected in less than five hours, with the most beneficial result. Surely the most cynical scepticism must give in to such facts. CASE 26.--Reported by Dr. MacDonald, of Murwillumbah, N.S.W. Mr. S., bitten on leg by a black snake. Coma, complete paralysis, chin hanging down to sternum, pupils dilated, &c. An injection of m. xv. had no effect; one of m. xx. very little. After a third one of m. x. patient suddenly became conscious, could walk without assistance, and in half an hour was sent to bed perfectly recovered. CASE 27.--Reported by Dr. Yeatman, of Auburn, South Australia. Mr. D., a farmer, aged 45 years, bitten on thumb; snake not named; cured by three injections of only m. v. each. Convulsions lasting for an hour came on three hours after treatment--a very rare occurrence--by Dr. Yeatman erroneously ascribed to the strychnine, which in so small a dose would not have produced them in the absence of snake-poison. CASE 28.--Reported by officer in charge of police at Grenfell. Boy of 6 years, bitten by brown snake, and treated by Dr. Rygate. CASE 29.--W. Toomer, aged 19, bitten by tiger snake on thumb and index finger, and not treated until 9-1/2 hours after bite, having a long distance to travel. Recovery very slow through timid use of antidote, five injections of 1/30th grain having but little effect, until one of 1/10th restored him. Treated by Dr. Stokes, of Echuca. CASE 30.--Reported by Dr. Bennett, surgeon, Gulgong Hospital, N.S.W. Mrs. Mears admitted to hospital comatose and pulseless, nothing having been done to check absorption. The intravenous injection of ammonia failing to rouse her, m. xv. of liq. strych. were injected, when pulse returned, but coma continued. After a second injection of m. xv. she suddenly became quite conscious, and in an hour was fully restored. CASE 31.--Reported by Dr. Mead, of Quirindi, N.S.W. John Simson, aged 15 years, bitten by a death adder on forefinger of right hand. Dr. Mead living 50 miles away, and the lad collapsing, a layman, Mr. Robert Simson, had to undertake treatment, and injected during the night m. 150 of a one in 240 solution of strychnine, equal to 5/8ths of a grain. Dr. Mead, finding the lad conscious and only a little drowsy, did not inject any more strychnine until 2 p.m., when a relapse took place. He then injected m. viii. of liq. str. P. B., and in half an hour m. vii. more. The last injection produced slight muscular twitchings, and subdued the snake-poison effectually, the lad making a good recovery. The total quantity used in 13 injections was over three-quarters of a grain within 18 hours. CASE 32.--This case is another instance of the successful use of the antidote by a layman, and can be verified by the writer, who saw the patient, a girl of 14 years, after her father had carried out the treatment successfully. The girl had been bitten by a large brown snake whilst walking through a paddock, and very soon afterwards lost the use of her legs, and for a time also her eyesight. The symptoms being so very alarming, and the girl at a distance of 35 miles from the writer's residence, the father at once injected 1/12th of a grain of strychnine, and in a very short time another 1/12th. The child then rallied somewhat, and a start was made to bring her in, the father taking the precaution of bringing the antidote-case with him. This was fortunate, for the child collapsed several times, and each time had to be roused by an injection before reaching the writer. When finally she presented herself, walking into the writer's surgery with a firm step, not a trace could be discovered either of the strychnine, of which nearly half a grain had been injected, nor of the snake-poison, also imparted no doubt in a fatal dose. The two punctures on her leg, testifying to the size of the snake that had bitten her, were the only tokens of the ordeal she had gone through; and the only task remaining for the writer was to congratulate her father (Mr. James Trebilcock, a farmer, of Tawanga), on the plucky manner in which he had carried out the treatment, and see to the child being properly watched during the night in case of a relapse taking place. None, however, occurred, and she left next morning perfectly well. Cases of this kind, in which no doctor is called in, are frequently reported to the writer, who finds that laymen are even more successful because less timid than many medical men. CASE 33.--Joseph Cartledge, bitten on calf of leg by a black snake, was treated by Dr. Browne, of Sale, five hours after accident. Two injections of 1/8th grain each used. CASE 34.--Miss Davie, teacher, at Nerung, Queensland, treated by Dr. Hannah, of Southport. Particulars not given. CASE 35.--Mrs. Rogers, of Bulu Bulu, Gippsland, bitten on finger by tiger snake, and treated by Dr. Trampy, first with intravenous injections of ammonia, which had no effect, and when sinking with strychnine injections, which had almost immediate effect, and in a few hours placed her out of danger. CASE 36.--Son of Mr. J. Beveridge, squatter, of Glengower, treated successfully by Dr. Andrew, of Clunes, with strychnine injections. CASE 37.--Theresa Byrne, aged 14 years, bitten whilst bathing, snake not seen. Treated by Dr. Cuppaidge, of Normanby, Queensland. Only 18 minims of L. S. required. CASE 38.--Mr. Bullock, of Tenterfield, N.S.W., bitten by black snake and treated by Dr. Morice. CASE 39.--A boy, J. Taylor, bitten at Mount Keat, agricultural settlement, Queensland, by a black snake, and treated successfully by a layman, Mr. James Daniels. CASE 40.--George Neilson, a Danish miner, bitten by a tiger snake whilst bathing. Case reported by Dr. Gamble, of Walhalla. Forty minims of liq. strych. required; recovery complete next morning. CASES 41 AND 42, reported by Dr. Helsham, of Richmond, N.S.W. In one of these where, judging from the symptoms, a large dose of snake-poison had been absorbed, but very small doses of strychnine were injected, convulsions set in, _whilst coma was still present_, and lasted for two hours. Though semi-tetanic in appearance they were erroneously ascribed to m. xxvi. of liq. strychniÃ¦, which at the time of their appearance had not removed the symptoms of snake-poison. They were evidently produced by the latter and quite on a par with those occasionally occurring in man before the strychnine is administered, and almost invariably in dogs. As long as coma is present with other symptoms denoting the snake-poison to be in active operation, such convulsions rather call for the antidote, than contra indicate its use, for the strychnine never produces them until it has completely conquered the snake-poison, and even then they are always preceded by local spasms and never set in suddenly. Timid medical men, when administering the antidote and anxiously watching for the dreaded strychnine effects, are too apt to see them in the slightest irregular muscular action. CASE 43, reported by Dr. Johnson, of Avoca, patient bitten by a tiger snake, was comatose, pulseless, with very shallow respiration, &c., and restored by three injections of m. xvi., xv. and x. within less than three hours. CASE 44.--Reported in _Australian Journal of Pharmacy_, from Tasmania, treated by Dr. Tofft, of Campbell Town. The report concludes: We have had some fatal cases of snakebite already this season, and the successful treatment in the above case has created a strong feeling in favour of strychnine in such emergencies. CASES 45 TO 49.--Reported by Dr. Alex. Barber to _A.M. Gazette_. He writes: ""During the last year I treated four cases of snakebite successfully with strychnine. In one of these, a bite of a brown snake, I injected three doses of m. xx. each of liq. strych. P.B., in all over half a grain, in one hour."" CASE 50.--Reported by Dr. Barrington, of Benalla (Vic.), bite of tiger snake, symptoms moderate. Completely removed in three hours by 57 minims of liq. strych. P.B. _Notes of eight cases as reported to the ""Australasian Medical Gazette"" for July and November, 1892, by R. P. Banerjee, B.A., G.B.M.S.L., Medical Officer, Salt Mines, Pachhadra, Rajputana, India_:-- CASE 1.--Bhagwan Singh, aged 30, Hindu male, Sepoy, E. T. Force, was bitten by a viperine snake (_echis carinata_) at 4 p.m. 10th June, 1892, in the dorsum of left foot. He was removed to the hospital, tight ligature applied, and with the following symptoms:--Heaviness of both legs, staggered if allowed to walk, giddiness, sense of sinking at the pit of the stomach, bleeding from mucous surfaces and old scars; soon fell swooning. Treatment.--The punctures incised, and blood let out, one-twelfth of a grain of strychniÃ¦; acetas hypodermically injected. Again, the insensibility not gone after 30 minutes, another dose given, and so repeated the third time. The _bleeding stopped_ and the man recovered his senses, but could not raise himself to talk. Many more doses were given under the skin, with hour intervals, and the man recovered the next day; but he was much exhausted and treated for weakness three days, and discharged to duty on the 14th. Punctures were distinct, symptoms well developed. Took _one and a half grains_ of strychnine to effect cure, leaving no after effects of the drug or poison. CASE 2.--Sadig Husain, a Mussulman boy, aged 12 years, bitten on the right ankle, just below the inner malleolus, by _echis carinata_ (Khapar) on the 5th August, 1891, brought in with usual symptoms, as before. Treatment as before. This case took only one-fourth grain of strych. acet. The boy was weak and sickly. He was discharged cured on the third day, _i.e._, 17th August, 1891. CASE 3.--Nathey Khan, Mussulman, customs peon, aged 35 years, robust and strong, bitten by _echis carinata_ (yellow variety). Punctures were on the left ankle, over the outer malleolus. Symptoms as before given. Treatment as before stated. This case took as much as one and three quarter grains of strych. acet. Was admitted on the 9th August, 1891, and discharged on the 12th August, 1891, cured and fit for duty. CASE 4.--Musamat Jewai, Hindu female, a labourer, age 40, strong built. Bitten by kerait (_Bungarus coeruleus_), about 2-1/2 feet long, above the left knee joint; ligature below the hip was used, but all the symptoms were present and the patient was insensible. Cyanotic marks were seen on the arms, abdomen, back and neck. At first all hopes of recovery were given up, but attempts were made to see if anything could do good. Treatment.--Punctures scarified and cupping applied. Repeated doses of strychnine acetas hypodermically given, but in _quarter grain_ doses. It seemed marvellous. The cyanotic patches in the skin gradually faded away and the body became warmer. It was wondered if the person had expired, but suddenly the woman called for a drink of cold water to bathe her dry and parching mouth. This was done and she recovered sense. She was admitted on the 3rd September, 1891, and discharged on the 10th. Took _three grains_ of acetate of strychnine to effect a cure. CASE 5.--Paroati Devi, Hindu female, aged 67 years, healthy constitution. Bitten on big toe of left foot on 10th September, 1891, symptoms were as preceding. The wound was cauterised. Treatment.--Strychnia was given very cautiously, as the patient was over-aged, the degeneration of the heart kept in view--1/10 grain eventually showed the peculiar strychnine symptoms. The patient was cured in two days and discharged cured on the third day, 14th September, 1891. This patient took in all _one and a half grains_ of acetate of strychnia. CASE 6.--Maya Swuper, aged 38 years, bitten by echis carinata (without dots) on the lower third of the left leg, on the outside of it. Mucous membrane of the mouth, eyes, nostrils, ears, and urinary passages all bled profusely. Urine had clots in it and symptoms resembled those in the first case. Treated with strychnine and recovered in four days. Was admitted on the 14th September, 1891, and discharged to duty on the 18th September, 1891. Took in all _three grains_ to effect cure. CASE 7.--Avghunandan, customs semadar, aged 55 years, Hindu male. Bitten at 8 a.m. on the 29th March, 1892, by echis carinata (brown variety) on the right foot near the cuboid bone. The punctures were distinct and the symptoms like those of case 1. Bleeding was profuse in this case. Treatment.--Strychnine acetas injected _in quarter grain_ doses under the skin and repeated as often as desirable. Patient recovered after the sixth day and took in _all four grains of strych. acet._ in six days. Only the bitten leg had erysipelatous inflammation, which had to be treated afterwards, but the man was quite safe. Remarks.--In connection with echis bites one peculiar symptom was always noticed, namely, the free oozing of blood from mucous surfaces and old scars of wounds. The power of co-ordination was very much affected from the first setting in of other symptoms. Usually after 24 hours symptoms showed a relapse. In the treatment with strychnia neither the symptoms of the drug nor of the snake-poison ever showed themselves afterwards. Both seemed to neutralise each other. Bungarus coeruleus, or kerait-bite, had its own peculiar symptoms of cyanotic patches and insensibility, swooning and stertorous breathing. The true comatose state was not present in any, but only a slight one noticed in cases 4 and 5. The other cases were generally delirious in the beginning. CASE 8.--Dr. Banerjee communicated this case to the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ separately and quite recently, November, 1892. It is, of all his cases, the most important one. He writes:--""The following case increases my number to eight, and should clear away prejudice and prepossessed ideas, as strychnine saved this case, a bite of _Duboia Russellii_. This snake is admitted by all hands to be virulently poisonous, and the poison is said to be even more virulent than that of the dreaded cobra:""-- _Rahimudden_, aged 43, Mussulman, customs peon, admitted for treatment of snakebite on the 13th September, 1892, at 10.45 p.m., to the North India Salt Revenue Hospital, Pachhadra, Rajputana, India, and put under my treatment. _History of the Case._--The man is of strong build and healthy constitution. While on duty he went round the salt pit, near his beat. Suddenly he felt a prick on his foot, and, suspecting snakebite, struck out with a bamboo stick he carried in his hand, and heard the snake make a loud noise. He at once tore a piece of cloth from his turban, and tied it tightly above the right ankle joint round the leg, then tried to kill the snake, but could not do so with certainty, as it was dark. He reported the case to his superiors, and was carried to the hospital. Bitten at 9.30 p.m.; admitted at 10.45 p.m. _Present Symptoms._--Patient was delirious, and could not understand what was told him; body cold and covered with perspiration; breathing hurried, with a low rattle at the end of expiration; mouth, tongue, and palate all dry; tongue leather-like and cracked, and felt cold; tickling of throat, not exciting vomiting; pupils dilated; conjunctiva congested; pulse 95; patient talked, or rather muttered, with difficulty; could not tolerate strong light or loud noise; the mucous membrane of the mouth showed irregular dark patches of ecchymosed blood. The right foot was swollen, and in a line between ankle and knuckle of big toe showed two punctures--one deep and bleeding, and surrounded by ecchymosis; the other one below this, more superficial, the blood oozing thin and not coagulating. Received, at 10.45 p.m., 1/12th grain of strychnine in left arm. At 11 p.m., the same dose; breathing the same, but no rattle; stupor rather deepening; incoherency increasing. At 11.15, the same dose; breathing easier; stupor the same; pulse, 85; temp, 97.6; delirious at times, and moaning with inarticulate cries; could not hear when spoken to in loud voice. 11.30 p.m., the same dose; no change in condition. 11.45 p.m., the same dose; stupor now fading away; delirium present; intolerant to light and noise; peculiar grin and cramp in face-muscles when attempting to talk; temp, 95.8; pulse very hard; intense thirst; less bleeding from punctures and blood thicker. 12 p.m., the same dose; no stupor now, but cramps in lower extremities; no incoherency; only occasionally uneasy and senseless for a moment, and then rising suddenly like one startled when sound asleep. 12.30 a.m., no further symptoms; bleeding stopped; great thirst; eyes red and glaring; saccharine drinks given; no injection. 3 a.m., no sleep, but only slight slumber; no pain in foot; no bleeding; temperature, 98.8; thirst unabated; only drinks given. _Sept. 14th, 10 a.m._--Better, but talking slightly incoherent; received another injection of 1/12th grain of strychnine. 6 p.m., better; had good appetite; given milk and sago. _Sept. 15th, 6 a.m._--Better. 6 p.m.--Better; had three motions, rice and milk diet given, slept soundly between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., no redness in eyes, swelling of foot abated. _Sept. 16th._--Better, only complaining of heaviness in head. At 9 p.m. had a fit of stupor all of a sudden, became insensible, and commenced to bleed again from the mucous membrane of mouth and nose. The patient became almost insensible, and could only be roused with difficulty. Twenty minims of liq. strychnine, equal to 1/6th grain, were now injected into the right arm. _At 9.20_ stupor had passed away and consciousness was fully restored. From this time onward convalescence was uninterrupted, and patient was discharged cured on the 20th Sept., 1892. In his remarks on this case Dr. Banerjee, after reporting that the snake with back broken in two places was brought to him on the following day from the exact locality where Rahimudden had been bitten, gives the following description of it:--Head, large and triangular; nostrils, large and kidney-shaped; scales, much imbricate, ventral scales 169, subcaudals 48; confluent, irregular ring-like, dark brown spots along the back, and with lateral black patches or rings with white borders. The head marking very peculiar double V shaped mark, the angle directed between the nostrils; interstitial coloration, yellowish brown, belly white, and with brown or amber spots; eyes, large, pupils erect, irides yellow; body, stout and compressed laterally; poison fangs, large and recurved, size about half an inch. The length of snake was 3 feet 5 inches, and from these characters it was identified to be the chain viper (_Duboia Russellii_, _Gray_), the most venomous of Indian vipers. The total quantity of the antidote in this case administered was only 110 minims of a one in 120 solution of strychniÃ¦ acetas, or 11/12ths of a grain of that drug. Considering the extremely venomous nature of the snake and the large quantities of strychnine required in some of the previously reported cases of echis and bungarus bites, the quantity used seems disproportional, but this evidently is explained by the fact that only one of the fangs perforated deeply, and at the back of the foot, probably struck the bone before entering to its full length, the snake thus failing to impart the full quantity of venom at its disposal. The chief interest of Dr. Banerjee's cases centres in the fact that they are mostly viper-bites. They prove conclusively, as do Feoktistow's experiments on the lower animals, that the theory of viper-poison being a blood poison, as asserted in all works on the subject, is not tenable and must be abandoned. If it effected changes in the blood, incompatible with life, strychnine, acting solely on the nerve-centres, could not possibly obliterate these changes within a few hours or even days. On the other hand the successful treatment of bungarus bite with strychnine places it beyond doubt that cobra-poison will also yield to it, if fearlessly and vigorously applied. It is most gratifying to the writer to know from good authority that Sir Joseph Fayrer, the President of the Medical Board at the India office, has recommended to the English Government the adoption of the strychnine treatment of snakebite in India, and that this adoption will not be subject once more to the doubtful result of experiments on the lower animals, which, according to newspaper reports, were contemplated at Calcutta as a test. It would have been deplorable to see more precious time lost in these experiments, whilst the only proper subjects for experiments, the unfortunate natives, are perishing by thousands. The step taken by Sir Joseph Fayrer does honour both to his head and his heart, and if his recommendation is accepted and vigorously carried out it will still further increase the debt of gratitude which India owes to British rule, and with regard to its terrible snake plague, to the one Englishman who of all others has distinguished himself by an almost life long study of the subject and indefatigable labours for its alleviation. Her Majesty the Queen has also been pleased most graciously to interest herself in this subject. Memorialised by the writer before Sir J. Fayrer's recommendation to the British Government, above alluded to, was known to him, our gracious Sovereign, ever intent on the welfare of her subjects, has resolved on having the writer's method thoroughly tried in India, and communicated this her intention to him in a despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to His Excellency the Governor of Victoria, dated 11th Nov., 1892, inviting him, at the same time, to forward any proposals he may have to make direct to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Home Department; and thus adding one more to the many noble deeds that mark her benevolent, long, and glorious reign. UNSUCCESSFUL CASES. Considering the newness of the strychnine treatment it would be folly to expect that the conditions necessary to insure success should have been observed in every case, and that every practitioner should at once have made himself familiar with it and the theory on which it is founded. Hence a few failures were unavoidable. Of these a record has been kept, but for obvious reasons the writer withholds it here. To give names and dates would be invidious, though the opponents of the treatment have exultingly pointed to the few deaths that have occurred as palpable proofs of its uselessness, some of them even going so far as to ascribe these deaths to the direct action of the antidote. There is, however, not a single case on record, in which death took place under strychnine-convulsions. All the patients died under palpable symptoms of snakebite-poisoning. As these symptoms have now been proven beyond all doubt to yield to strychnine, when properly administered, the inference that it was not so administered in the cases referred to becomes not only justifiable, but unavoidable. In one case only, that of a child of tender years, blood was vomited so copiously that death may be ascribed to that cause and the snake-poison combined, but in all the other six fatal ones, mostly of children, it was undoubtedly due to the snake-poison not being properly checked by the antidote. The gentlemen who officiated on these occasions were evidently not Banerjees, but the very reverse of their Indian confrÃ¨re. They do not appear to have had very clear ideas of the absolute antagonism existing between the two poisons, and entirely disregarded the most important point in the treatment, namely, the necessity of administering the antidote until it has completely subdued the snake poison, regardless of the quantity that may be required for that purpose. In a few instances the treatment was correct enough at first, but when, as is often the case, a relapse took place after the patient had apparently recovered, the large quantity of the antidote already administered appears to have given rise to the erroneous notion that it would be useless to resort to it a second time, and thus, through this error and the fear of strychnine-convulsions, the patients were allowed to die. In most of the six fatal cases collected by the writer, however, the doses and total quantities given were altogether inadequate to cope with the poison. They did probably more harm than good, for the snake-poison when only partially checked by strychnine seems to renew its onslaught on the nerve-cells even more insidiously than when not interfered with at all. Convulsions also, as shown in cases, are sometimes called forth by this timid use of the antidote. A few instances will show the correctness of these observations. Thus an old woman sleeping in a shed is awakened at daylight by a tiger snake having fastened on to her wrist. She pulls off the snake, alarms the neighbours, and a doctor, living only a mile away from the place, is sent for. He appears on the scene four hours afterwards, when complete coma and collapse has set in, makes two injections of gr. 1/15 each, which of course had no effect and the patient is allowed to die without any further effort on the part of her medical attendant. Case 2.--A boy of 10 years is admitted to a N. S. Wales hospital in a state of complete collapse, barely alive, having been bitten by a brown snake 22 hours before admission. Instead of a rousing injection of at least 15 minims and the same or smaller ones repeated at short intervals, he receives only 5 minims of liq. strychniÃ¦ P.B. every twenty minutes, when death was imminent, and dies 65 minutes after admission. Case 3 is also that of a boy in an hospital. He is admitted fully conscious and apparently but slightly under the influence of snake-poison, for a five minims injection is reported to have removed the symptoms. On the following day, however, he became comatose, and instead of having the antidote freely administered, gets only one more injection of five minims and dies in coma. Case 4 is even worse. A little girl of 3 years, bitten by a tiger snake, receives three minim injections every half-hour, and after three of them, whilst in a state of complete coma, gets convulsions. These are attributed to the strychnine, which thereupon is withheld, the finale being death in coma. There can be no doubt that in all these cases life could have been preserved under a more energetic treatment. Hereafter, when theory and treatment are better understood, and when officialdom has seen fit to issue instructions as to the proper treatment of snakebite to medical practitioners, such cases as those cited will be put down as malpractice and have to be accounted for. Until then the guardians of the health and the lives of her Majesty's subjects, and a certain portion of the medical press of Australia, superciliously and persistently ignoring the subject, are more responsible for the lives lost than the busy country practitioner, who may not have had time or opportunity to inform himself thoroughly on a comparatively new subject, more especially at a period when Banerjee had not yet taught us that in administering strychnine as antidote to snake-poison we can venture into grains of it with impunity. * * * * * Since the above chapters were put in proof, the writer has seen a fatal case of tiger snake bite, conveying two lessons of such interest and importance that it must be placed on record here. It illustrates in an extraordinary and forcible degree the erratic, capricious, and insidious course the snake-poison takes at times. * * * * * A handsome girl of 17 is bitten in a bathroom on the back of the second right toe at dusk on a Sunday evening by a half-grown tiger snake, subsequently caught and killed in the room. She does not suspect snakebite, and no ligature is applied until the poison has been absorbed and overpowers her. Instead of sinking into coma, she becomes unconscious for a short time only. Her brain then clears itself, and all symptoms seem to disappear so completely that when a medical man of undoubted ability and skill sees her a few hours after the bite, she declares herself quite well again, and does not appear to require any treatment, least of all that by strychnine injections. She passes a good night, but on Monday morning symptoms denoting paresis of the respiratory and glosso-pharyngeal centres make their appearance, almost identical with those described by Indian writers as following cobra-bite. She has difficulty in breathing and swallowing, but one injection of 1/10th of a grain removes it completely and speedily, and once more all danger is thought to be past. On Monday evening, however, dyspnoea and dysphagia appear again in an aggravated form. The urine also becomes scanty and loaded with albuminates. Strychnine now is again resorted to, but it fails to act as before, and from hour to hour the young lady's condition becomes more critical. When the writer reached her on Tuesday afternoon, 42 hours after the bite, paralysis of the centres named was imminent, and her case appeared a hopeless one, unless a vigorous use of strychnine yet turned the scales in her favour. One-tenth grain doses were therefore injected every half-hour, and continued until the physiological action of the drug showed itself. This took place, but failed to have the least effect on the affected centres; and complete paralysis ensued 45 hours after the infliction of the fatal bite. The first lesson the Australian practitioner should learn from this sad case is that of extreme care and caution in dealing with any case of snakebite, no matter how slight it may appear at first sight. It is not for the first time we have been taught this lesson, though it has rarely, if ever, been conveyed in so singular a manner. Recent utterances about the innocuousness of Australian snake-poison find a fitting answer in this melancholy occurrence. The second lesson it conveys is a new one, even to the writer. From the fact of one strychnine injection removing all poison-symptoms early on Monday, but the free use of the antidote failing entirely to have this effect on Monday night and on Tuesday, we are warranted to draw the conclusion that the antidote can only be relied on within the first 24 hours after the bite; and that, after this period, the snake-poison produces organic changes in the affected nerve-cells, preventing their depressed functional activity from being restored by the antidote. Further observations, of course, are required to confirm these conclusions. Their correctness, however, appears to be borne out by the fact observed by the writer, that the larger domestic animals, who sometimes linger on for days after being bitten by a snake, usually recover under the strychnine treatment if it is applied immediately or soon after a bite, but die when found and treated in an advanced stage of the malady. That the grave kidney complication, checking the elimination of the poison from the system, militated against recovery in this case, and greatly influenced the singular course of the poisoning process, cannot be doubted. [Illustration] CONCLUSION. In the little work submitted herewith to the medical profession and the general public, for both of whom it is intended, the author may justly claim to have solved the difficult and long-standing problem of snake-poison. We have at last a correct theory of its action, and, what is of more importance to the public, we have an effective antidote. These facts, being as fully established in these pages as any scientific facts can be, the most exacting and even captious criticism will not upset, nor can further research add anything very material to the writer's deductions and their final result. In order to show how an obscure Australian country practitioner succeeded in a discovery, for which all his predecessors in this field of research had laboured in vain, it will be necessary in conclusion to give a short history of the discovery as by slow degrees it has originated and matured in the writer's mind, who during the last 35 years with respect to this subject had followed the advice which Schiller gives in his grand poem, ""Die Glocke:""-- Wer etwas Treffliches leisten will, HÃ¤tt' gern was Grossesgeboren, Der sammle still und unerschlafft Im kleinsten Punkte die grÃ¶sste Kraft, which, translated into English, means that whoever aims at any great achievement must quietly, but indefatigably, concentrate the highest force on the smallest point. Now this smallest point has to the writer been snake-poison from the very commencement of his Australian career. When yet a new-chum, a vigorous tiger snake gave him the first lesson on the action of the insidious venom which nearly cost him his life, but afforded some valuable glimpses into the mystery of snakebite--in fact, gave him the key to unlock that mystery. On analysing the horrid sensations he had experienced before he lost consciousness, and even after regaining it, he saw ""depressed nerve-action, emanating from the central nervous system,"" written on the face of every one of them, so much so that this became the foundation and corner stone of his present structure, which, however, it took him a quarter of a century to erect; for the material he required, namely, cases of snakebite observed from an early stage, and from which all disturbing elements were excluded, did not occur very frequently in his practice. Though he lived all the time among mountains, the beautiful Australian Alps, on the rivers and creeks of which snakes are abundant, and though these creatures and anything connected with them had an almost fascinating interest for him, years sometimes elapsed without adding one single good case to his notes. Sometimes his patients were dead when he reached them, and all his entreaties for an autopsy were in vain with the relatives. More frequently he found that they were not bitten at all, and only suffered from the effects of fear or of enormous doses of alcohol. On persons really bitten, but completely paralysed and comatose, observations were also unsatisfactory, as they had to be supplemented by second-hand evidence obtained from those who had been with them before they became unconscious. Thus within 25 years the author did not see more than half-a-dozen really instructive cases; and frequently his desire for more evidence overcame his reluctance to inflict on animals the agony of snakebite he had himself endured, and he made a few experiments, but soon gave them up again as unsatisfactory. All the evidence, however, he had thus far collected tended to confirm the correctness of his ideas as to the action of snake-poison. At last, some ten years ago, he obtained absolute certainty, and this, strange to relate, by a case of spider bite. He was called early one morning to visit a little boy, two years old, and on examination found that he presented symptoms almost identical with those of snakebite poisoning. Although there was no evidence of the child having come in contact with a snake, the writer naturally concluded that during the night a snake had obtained access to the bedroom through the open door or window, and after biting the child sleeping in its low cot, had escaped again. He therefore searched most carefully for the usual two punctures, but they were not to be found. The child evidently laboured under the effect of some poison, and spiderbite suggested itself, but the symptoms were so much more aggravated than anything the writer had frequently seen of spiderbite that he hesitated to accept it as the cause, although it appeared almost the only possible one. A careful inquiry into the history of the case elicited from the mother the important fact that on the previous afternoon the little fellow, just able to toddle about, had gradually lost the use of his legs, and also become very peevish, and that suspecting nothing but a little temporary indisposition, she had put him to bed, to find him in the morning all but dead. He was scarcely breathing when the writer saw him, and only the stethoscope gave evidence of the heart still beating feebly. His body was very cold, pupils widely dilated, and the sight even apparently gone, the eyes wide open, staring fixedly upwards and not noticing a lighted match in closest proximity to them. Consciousness also appeared extinct, as liquids introduced into the mouth were not swallowed. Examining once more for traces of spiderbite in the skin, the writer noticed faint red stripes extending up the arm from a little cut on the right index finger near the nail, and on inquiry it was ascertained at last from an elder brother that he had seen the child pick up a little black spider with a red back, hold it for some time between thumb and index finger, and then throw it away. This was evidently the Katipo (_Latrodectus icelio_), the poison of which acts on the same principle as snake-poison, but generally much milder. The greater severity of its action in this case was accounted for by the mandibles having been inserted into the cut, and the insect, being squeezed by the child, having emptied the whole available contents of its poison gland into the cellular tissue exposed in the cut, whence it was quickly absorbed. This also accounted for the absence of all irritation and of the neuralgic pains usually accompanying spiderbite, when the mandibles merely perforate the epidermis and the poison is deposited in the upper cutis, where absorption is slow and local irritation consequently greater. Minuteness of detail in relating this case must be excused on account of the extreme interest and importance attached to it. Being brought about under such peculiar and almost unique circumstances it presented the effects of spider-poison in a superlative degree and showed them to be identical with those of snake-poison. But whilst the latter ushers in the symptoms with such rapidity that they cover each other and are difficult of separate analysis, in this case the highly significant paresis of the lower extremities, evidently of central origin, remained separate for some time. Taking this symptom for his guide and interpreting the formidable array of the others, developed during the night, on the same principle, the writer's diagnosis of the case, as it presented itself to him, was paralysis of the motor and vaso-motor nerve-centres. This, he found, and this alone could explain all the symptoms, and he therefore determined to put its correctness to a practical test. There was but one remedy to make this test with and this had to be applied without delay, for the child was rapidly sinking and had almost ceased to breathe. _One twelfth of a grain_ of strychnine was therefore injected in the arm, a bold dose for so young a child, but, as the result showed, exactly the one that was required. The test was eminently successful. Having to leave the child immediately after the injection, the writer on returning in half an hour found his little patient sitting up in bed, perfectly restored, with both poisons so completely neutralising each other, that not a trace of either could be detected. Thus the writer's structure was at last completed, and an insignificant spider furnished the last material required for an important discovery. There are a few hypothetical points yet in the explanation of some of the symptoms of snakebite-poisoning by the writer's theory, but these imperfections are more those of science than of the theory. The whole subject of vaso-motor paralysis for instance, and of the pathological changes that follow it, is more or less a _terra incognita_. Diapedesis is now supposed to be the result of blood pressure, but it occurs in snakebite, where blood pressure is at zero. Feoktistow, we have seen, produced it locally on the mesentery of animals with normal blood pressure, whilst Banerjee arrested by strychnine-injections profuse hÃ¦morrhages from all the mucous surfaces, which were no doubt the result of diapedesis. We know that neither snake-poison nor strychnine affect the nerve ends but only the nerve cells. There must therefore be nerve cells at or near the terminations of the nerves regulating the capillary circulation in the mucous membranes, but microscopical anatomy has yet to find them, for minute ganglia have only been discovered at present in sympathetic nerve ends of the abdomen. On other subjects also, besides that of vaso-motor paralysis, the strychnine treatment of snakebite has thrown an unexpected light. We did not know before it was demonstrated by this treatment that sleep is merely a reduced discharge of motor-nerve force, a partial turning off of the motor-batteries, by which, through rest, they are invigorated for fresh action during the waking hours, and that the degrees of this reduction range in their effects from sleep, more or less deep, down to coma, and can be raised again from coma to sleep, and from sleep to complete wakefulness. We knew that every movement and action is brought about by a discharge of this force, but we did not know that even the silent thought must be carried on the wings of it, and cannot take place without it, at least not in our present state of existence. All these important revelations are now the property of science, and it will be well for science to take note of them. * * * * * In conclusion, the writer may be permitted to express his joy and thankfulness for having been made the instrument, by Divine Providence, to confer a boon on humanity that will prevent much suffering and thousands of premature, untimely deaths. +-----------------------------------------------+ | Transcriber's Note: | | | | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the | | original document have been preserved. | | | | Typographical errors corrected in the text: | | | | Page 23 intracardial changed to intracardiac | | Page 69 Banarjee changed to Banerjee | | Page 73 ease changed to case | +-----------------------------------------------+ *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ON SNAKE-POISON: ITS ACTION AND ITS ANTIDOTE *** Updated editions will replace the previous oneâthe old editions will be renamed.

R. HARDING.] INTRODUCTION. Scattered from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean are thousands of trappers who use deadfalls, snares and other home-made traps, but within this vast territory there are many thousand who know little or nothing of them. The best and most successful trappers are those of extended experience. Building deadfalls and constructing snares, as told on the following pages, will be of value to trappers located where material--saplings, poles, boards, rocks, etc.--is to be had for constructing. The many traps described cannot all be used to advantage in any section, but some of them can. More than sixty illustrations are used to enable the beginner to better understand the constructing and workings of home-made traps. The illustrations are mainly furnished by the ""old timers."" Chapters on Skinning and Stretching, Handling and Grading are added for the correct handling of skins and furs adds largely to their commercial value. A. R. Harding. DEADFALLS AND SNARES CHAPTER I. BUILDING DEADFALLS. During the centuries that trapping has been carried on, not only in America, but thruout the entire world, various kinds of traps and snares have been in use and taken by all classes of trappers and in all sections the home-made traps are of great numbers. The number of furs caught each year is large. The above was said by a trapper some years ago who has spent upwards of forty years in the forests and is well acquainted with traps, trappers and fur-bearing animals. Whether the statement is true or not, matters but little, altho one thing is certain and that is that many of the men who have spent years in trapping and have been successful use the deadfalls and snares as well as steel traps. Another trapper says: In my opinion trapping is an art and any trapper that is not able to make and set a deadfall, when occasion demands, does not belong to the profession. I will give a few of the many reasons why dead falls are good. 1. There is no weight to carry. 2. Many of the best trappers use them. 3. It requires no capital to set a line of deadfalls. 4. There is no loss of traps by trap thieves, but the fur is in as much danger. 5. Deadfalls do not mangle animals or injure their fur. 6. It is a humane way of killing animals. 7. There is no loss by animals twisting off a foot or leg and getting away. 8. Animals are killed outright, having no chance to warn others of their kind by their cries from being caught. 9. Trappers always have the necessary outfit (axe and knife) with them to make and set a deadfall that will kill the largest animals. 10. The largest deadfalls can be made to spring easy and catch small game if required. 11. Deadfalls will kill skunk without leaving any scent. 12. Deadfalls are cheap and trappers should be familiar with them. It is a safe proposition, however, that not one-half of the trappers of today can build a deadfall properly or know how to make snares, and many of them have not so much as seen one. First a little pen about a foot square is built of stones, chunks, or by driving stakes close together, leaving one side open. The stakes should be cut about thirty inches long and driven into the ground some fourteen inches, leaving sixteen or thereabout above the ground. Of course if the earth is very solid, stakes need not be so long, but should be so driven that only about sixteen inches remain above ground. A sapling say four inches in diameter and four feet long is laid across the end that is open. A sapling that is four, five or six inches in diameter, owing to what you are trapping for, and about twelve feet long, is now cut for the ""fall."" Stakes are set so that this pole or fall will play over the short pole on the ground. These stakes should be driven in pairs; two about eighteen inches from the end; two about fourteen farther back. (See illustration.) [Illustration: THE POLE DEADFALL.] The small end of the pole should be split and a small but stout stake driven firmly thru it so there will be no danger of the pole turning and ""going off"" of its own accord. The trap is set by placing the prop (which is only seven inches in length and half an inch thru) between the top log and the short one on the ground, to which is attached the long trigger, which is only a stick about the size of the prop, but about twice as long, the baited end of which extends back into the little pen. The bait may consist of a piece of chicken, rabbit or any tough bit of meat so long as it is fresh and the bloodier the better. An animal on scenting the bait will reach into the trap--the top of the pen having been carefully covered over--between the logs. When the animal seizes the bait the long trigger is pulled off of the upright prop and down comes the fall, killing the animal by its weight. Skunk, coon, opossum, mink and in fact nearly all kinds of animals are easily caught in this trap. The fox is an exception, as it is rather hard to catch them in deadfalls. The more care that you take to build the pen tight and strong, the less liable is some animal to tear it down and get bait from the outside; also if you will cover the pen with leaves, grass, sticks, etc., animals will not be so shy of the trap. The triggers are very simple, the long one being placed on top of the upright, or short one. The long triggers should have a short prong left or a nail driven in it to prevent the game from getting the bait off too easy. If you find it hard to get saplings the right size for a fall, and are too light, they can be weighted with a pole laid on the ""fall."" [Illustration: SMALL ANIMAL FALL.] I will try and give directions and drawing of deadfalls which I have used to some extent for years, writes a Maine trapper, and can say that most all animals can be captured in them as shown in illustration. You will see the deadfall is constructed of stakes and rocks and is made as follows: Select a place where there is game; you need an axe, some nails, also strong string, a pole four inches or more in diameter. Notice the cut No. 1 being the drop pole which should be about six to seven feet long. No. 2 is the trip stick, No. 3 is string tied to pole and trip stick, No. 4 is the stakes for holding up the weight, No. 5 is the small stakes driven around in the shape of letter U, should be one foot wide and two feet long. No. 6 is the rocks, No. 7 is the bait. Now this is a great trap for taking skunk and is soon built where there are small saplings and rocks. This trap is also used for mink and coon. * * * The trapper's success depends entirely upon his skill and no one can expect the best returns unless his work is skillfully done. Do not Attempt to make that deadfall unless you are certain that you can make it right and do not leave it till you are certain that it could not be any better made. I have seen deadfalls so poorly made and improperly set that they would make angels weep, neither were they located where game was apt to travel. The deadfall if made right and located where game frequents is quite successful. Another thing, boys, think out every little plan before you attempt it. If so and so sets his traps one way, see if you can't improve on his plan and make it a little better. Do not rush blindly into any new scheme, But look at it on all sides and make yourself well acquainted with the merits and drawbacks of it. Make good use of your brains, for the animal instinct is its only protection and it is only by making good use of your reasoning powers that you can fool him. Experience may cost money sometimes and loss of patience and temper, but in my estimation it is the trapper's best capital. An old trapper who has a couple of traps and lots of experience will catch more fur than the greenhorn with a complete outfit. Knowledge is power in trapping as in all other trades. This is the old reliable ""pinch-head."" The picture does not show the cover, so I will describe it. Get some short pieces of board or short poles and lay them on the stones in the back part of the pen and on the raised stick in front. Lay them close together so the animal cannot crawl in at the top. Then get some heavy stones and lay them on the cover to weight down and throw some dead weeds and grass over the pen and triggers and your trap is complete. When the animal tries to enter and sets off the trap by pressing against the long trigger in front, he brings the weighted pole down in the middle of his back, which soon stops his earthly career. [Illustration: THE PINCH HEAD.] This deadfall can also be used at runways without bait. No pen or bait is required. The game will be caught coming from either direction. The trap is ""thrown"" by the trigger or pushing against it when passing thru. During snowstorms the trap requires considerable attention to keep in perfect working order, but at other times is always in order when placed at runways where it is used without bait. The trap can also be used at dens without bait with success. If used with bait it should be placed a few feet from the den or near any place frequented by the animal or animals you expect to catch. Of course we all admit the steel trap is more convenient and up-to-date, says a New Hampshire trapper. You can make your sets faster and can change the steel trap from place to place; of course, the deadfall you cannot. But all this does not signify the deadfall is no good; they are good and when mink trapping the deadfall is good. To the trapper who traps in the same locality every year, when his deadfalls are once built it is only a few minutes' work to put them in shape, then he has got a trap for the season. I enclose a diagram of a deadfall (called here Log Trap) which, when properly made and baited, there is no such a mink catcher in the trap line yet been devised. This trap requires about an hour to make and for tools a camp hatchet and a good strong jackknife, also a piece of strong string, which all trappers carry. This trap should be about fifteen inches wide with a pen built with sticks or pieces of boards driven in the ground. (See diagram.) The jaws of this trap consist of two pieces of board three inches wide and about three and a half feet long, resting edgeways one on the other, held firmly by four posts driven in the ground. The top board or drop should move easily up and down before weights are put on. The treddle should be set three inches inside level with the top of bottom board. This is a round stick about three-fourths inch thru, resting against two pegs driven in the ground. (See diagram.) The lever should be the same in size. Now put your stout string around top board. Then set, pass lever thru the string over the cross piece and latch it in front of the treddle. Then put on weights and adjust to spring, heavy or light as desired. This trap should be set around old dams or log jams by the brook, baited with fish, muskrat, rabbit or chicken. [Illustration: BOARD OR POLE TRAP.] I herewith enclose a drawing of a deadfall that I use for everything up to bear, writes a Rocky Mountain trapper, I hate to acknowledge that I have used it to get ""lope"" meat with, because I sometimes believe in firing as few shots as I can in some parts of the Mountains. [Illustration: BAIT SET DEADFALL.] Drawing No. 1 shows it used for bait; a snare can be used on it at the same time by putting the drop or weight where it isn't liable to fall on the animal. Put the weight on the other side of tree or make it fall with the animal to one side. In this case a pole must be strictly used. A good sized rock is all right for small animals. The closer spikes 1 and 2 are together and the longer the tugger end on bottom, the easier it will pull off. Fig. 1.--Spike driven in tree one-half inch deeper than spike No. 2 (Fig. No. 2) to allow for notch. 3--Bait on end of trigger. 4--Heavy rock or log. 5--Wire, fine soft steel. 6--Trigger with notch cut in it. 7--Notch cut in trigger Fig G. Spike No. 2 must have head cut off and pounded flat on end. In setting it across a trail a peg must be driven in the ground. In this peg the spikes are driven instead of tree as in drawing No. 1. The end of brush stick in between peg and trigger end and when an animal comes either way it will knock the brush and it knocks out the trigger. Good, soft steel wire should be used In setting this deadfall along river bank a stout stick can be driven in bank and hang out over water. This stick will take the place of a limb on tree. One end of a pole held in a slanting position by weighing one end down with a rock will do the same as limb on tree. If a tree is handy and no limb, lean a stout pole up against the tree and cut notches in it for wire to work on. [Illustration: TRAIL SET DEADFALL.] 1--Trail. 2--Log. 3--Trigger same as for bait on top deadfall drawing. 4--Stake driven in ground with spikes driven in it same as above in tree. 5--Spikes same as above. 6--Wire. 7--Tree. 8--Brush put in trail with one end between trigger and peg to knock off trigger when touched. This deadfall has never failed me and when trapping in parts of the country where lynx, coyote or wolverine are liable to eat marten in traps, use a snare and it will hang 'em high and out of reach. Snare to be fastened to trigger. Of course a little pen has to be built when setting this deadfall with bait. In setting in trail it beats any deadfall I have ever used for such animals as have a nature to follow a trail. A fine wire can also be tied to the trigger and stretched across trail instead of a brush and tied on the opposite side of trail. I like it, as the weight can be put high enough from the ground to kill an elk when it drops. CHAPTER II. BEAR AND COON DEADFALL. I will explain how to make the best bear deadfall, also the best one for coon that ever was made, writes an old and successful deadfall trapper. First get a pole six or eight feet long for bed piece, get another sixteen or eighteen feet long and lay it on top of bed piece. Now drive two stakes, one on each side of bed piece and pole and near one end of bed piece. About 18 or 20 inches from first two stakes drive two more stakes, one on each side of bed piece and fall pole. Now drive two more stakes directly in front of your two back stakes and about two inches in front. Next cut a stick long enough to come just to the outside of last two stakes driven. Then whittle the ends off square so it will work easy between the treadle stakes and the two inside stakes that your fall works in; next raise your fall pole about three feet high. Get a stick about one inch thru, cut it so that it will be long enough to rest against your treadle and that short stick is your treadle when it is raised above the bed a piece, cut the end off slanting so it will fit against the treadle good. [Illustration: BEAR OR COON DEADFALL.] Slant the other end so the fall pole will fit good. Now five or six inches from the top of the slanted stick cut a notch in your slanted stick. Go to the back side, lift your pole up, set the post on the bed piece. Place the top of the slanted stick against the fall pole. Then place the pole off post in the notch in slant stick. Press back on bottom of slanted stick and place your treadle against the stick. Your trap is set. Make V shape on inside of treadle by driving stakes in the ground, cedar or pine, and hedge it in tight all around. If such there is not, make it as tight as you can. Cover the top tight, the cubby should be 3 feet long, 3 feet high and wide as your treadle stakes. Stake the bait near the back end of cubby. Be sure the treadle is just above the bed piece. Take the pole off the cubby to set the trap as you have set it from this side. You can set it heavy or light by regulating the treadle. I sometimes drive spikes in the bed piece and file them off sharp as it will hold better. You can weight the fall poles as much as you like after it is set. Don't you see, boys, that the old fellow comes along and to go in he surely will step on the treadle. Bang, it was lowered and you have got him. This is the best coon deadfall I ever saw. The fall pole for coon should be about 14 inches high when set. Set it under trees or along brooks where you can see coon signs. Bait with frogs, crabs or fish, a piece of muskrat or duck for coon. Build it much the same as for bear, only much smaller. You will find this a successful trap. * * * I will describe a deadfall for bear which I use, and which works the best of any I have tried, says a Montana trapper. I have two small trees about 30 inches apart, cut a pole 10 feet long for a bed piece and place in front of trees then cut a notch in each tree about 27 inches above the bed piece, and nail a good, strong piece across from one tree to the other in the notches. Cut a long pole five or six inches through for the deadfall, place the large end on top of bed log, letting end stick by the tree far enough to place on poles for weights. Then cut two stakes and drive on outside of both poles, and fasten top of stakes to the trees one foot above the cross piece. Then on the inside, 30 inches from the trees, drive two more solid stakes about 2 feet apart and nail a piece across them 6 inches lower than the cross piece between the trees. Then cut a lever about three feet long and flatten one end, and a bait stick about two feet long. Cut two notches 6 inches apart, one square on the top and the other on the bottom, and both close to the top end of bait stick. Fasten bait on the other end and then raise up the deadfall, place the lever stick across the stick nailed between the two trees, letting the end run six inches under the deadfall. Take the bait stick and hook lower notch on the piece nailed on the two stakes and place end of lever in the top notch, then cut weights and place on each side until you think you have enough to hold any bear. Then put on as many more and it will be about right. Stand up old chunks around the sides and back and lots of green brush on the outside. Get it so he can't see the bait. It doesn't require a very solid pen. I drive about three short stakes in front and leave them one foot high, so when he pulls back they will come against him, and the set is complete. You can weight it with a ton of poles and still it will spring easy. The closer together the two notches the easier it will spring. This trap can be built lighter and is good for coon. In fact, will catch other fur bearers, but is not especially recommended for small animals, such as ermine and mink. CHAPTER III. OTTER DEADFALLS. At the present day when steel traps are so cheap and abundant it may sound very primitive and an uncertain way of trapping these animals for one to advocate the use of the deadfall, especially as every hunter knows the animal is much more at home in the water than on land. But on land they go and it was by deadfalls the way-back Indians killed a many that were in their packs at the end of the hunting season. Of course these wooden traps were not set at haphazard thru the brush as marten traps, but were set up at the otter slide places, and where they crossed points in river bends, or it might be where a narrow strip of land connected two lakes. These places were known from one generation to another and the old traps were freshened up spring and fall by some member of the family hunting those grounds. These special deadfalls were called otter traps, but really when once set were open for most any animal of a medium size passing that path. The writer has known beaver, lynx, fox and in one instance a cub bear to be caught in one of these deadfalls. There was a simplicity and usefulness about these traps that commended them to the trapper and even now in this rush century some hunters might use them with advantage. When once set, they remain so until some animal comes along and is caught. I say ""caught"" because if properly erected they rarely miss. They require no bait and therefore are never out of order by the depredations of mice, squirrels or moose birds. I knew a man who caught two otters together. This may sound fishy, but when once a present generation trapper sees one of these traps set he will readily believe this apparently impossible result is quite likely to happen. The trap is made thus: Cut four forked young birch about five feet long, pointing the lower ends and leaving the forks uppermost. Plant two of these firmly in the ground at each side of the otter path, three inches apart between them and about twenty inches across the path. These must be driven very hard in the ground and a throat piece put in level between the uprights across the path from side to side. As a choker and to support the weight of logs to kill the otter, cut a pole (tamarac preferable) long enough to pass three feet each side of your picket or uprights, see that this falls easy and clear. [Illustration: OTTER DEADFALL.] Now cut two short poles for the forks to lay in from side to side of the path, being in the same direction as the choker. At the middle of one of these short poles tie a good stout cord or rope (the Indians used split young roots), making a loop of same long enough to lay over the pole in front and down to the height the choke pole is going to be. When set, next comes the trigger which must be of hard wood and about a foot long, round at one end and flat at the other. A groove is hacked out all around the stick at the round end. This is to tie the cord to. The choke stick is now brought up to say twenty inches from the ground and rested on top of the trigger. A stick about an inch in diameter is placed outside the pickets and the flat end of the trigger is laid in against this. The tied stick to be about eight inches from the ground. The tying at the end of the trigger being at one side will create a kind of leverage sufficiently strong to press hard against the tied stick. Care must be taken, however, to have this pressure strong enough but not too strong for the animal to set off. Now load each end of the choke stick with small laps of wood to insure holding whatever may catch. A little loose moss or grass is placed fluffy under tread stick when set to insure the otter going over and not under. When he clambers over the tread stick his weight depresses it, the trigger flies up, letting the loaded bar fall on his body, which holds him till death. While my description of the making of a deadfall for otters is plain enough to me, yet the novice may not succeed in constructing one the first time. Still if he is a trapper he will very soon perceive where any mistake may be and correct it. I have used both steel traps and deadfalls and altho I do not wish to start a controversy yet I must say that a deadfall well set is a good trap. For marten on a stump they are never covered unless with snow, nor is the marten when caught destroyed by mice. Of course, to set a deadfall for otter it must be done in the fall before the ground is frozen. Once made, however, it can be set up either spring or fall and will, with a little repairs, last for years. I am aware the tendency of the age is to progress and not to use obsolete methods, still even some old things have their advantages. Good points are not to be sneered at and one of these I maintain for spring and fall trapping in a district where otter move about from lake to lake or river to river is the old time Indian deadfall.

Having seen a good many descriptions of deadfalls in the H-T-T lately, writes a Colorado trapper, I thought I would try to show the kind that is used around here for marten. It is easily made, and can always be kept above the snow. First, cut a pole (z) five or six inches through and twelve feet long, lay it in the crotch of a tree five feet from the ground. Then cut two sticks two inches through and fifteen inches long, cut a notch in each three inches from the top and have the notch in one slant downwards (B), the other upwards (A). The sticks should be nailed on each side of the pole (z), the top of which should be flattened a little. Have the notches about six inches above the top of the pole. Cut another stick 10 inches long (F), cut the top off square and nail it six inches farther down the pole on the same side as (B), have the top five inches above the top of pole (Z). Now cut two more sticks two and one-half feet long (C-D), cut a notch in each two inches from the top and nail a stick (E) across them in the notches, so they will be about seven inches apart. Set a straddle of the pole (Z); they should be two inches farther down the pole than (F). Then cut another pole (X) ten feet long, lay it under (Z), lift up one end of it and nail the stick C and D to each side of it. See that when the sticks C, D and E are lifted up they will fall clear and easily. [Illustration: MARTEN DEADFALL.] Now cut a bait stick (G) one-half inch through and seven inches long, sharpened at one end. Cut another stick (H) an inch through and fifteen inches long, flatten a little on one side. To set the trap lift up C, D, E and X, and put the end of H under E and rest it on the top of F, hold down the other end while you put the bait stick (G) in the notches A and B, then let the end of H come up on the outside of B against the end of G. Put the bait on the other end of G; when the end is pulled out of the notch the trap will spring and spring easily if made properly. Lay a block of wood at the back end and some small sticks on top, so the animal will have to crawl under E to get the bait. Muskrat makes the best bait for marten. * * * When you find a tall straight spruce or something that is pretty straight (not a balsam) cut it about a foot over your head, says a Northwestern trapper, or as high as you can. When you have cut it, split the stump down the center two feet. Be careful doing this, for you are striking a dangerous blow as I have good cause to know and remember. Trim out the tree clean and taper off the butt end to make it enter into split. Drive down into split about fourteen inches. Cut a crotch into ground or snow solid. Now cut the mate of this piece already in, split and put into split and into crotch on top of other. Have the piece heavy enough to hold wolverine. See cuts for the rest. Cover bait as shown in cut. I do not make my trip sticks the same as others, but I am afraid that I cannot explain it to you. See cuts for this also. Use your own judgment. Of course you will sometimes find it is not necessary to go to all this bother. For instance, sometimes you will find a natural hanger for your trap. Then you don't have to have the long peg or pole to hold it stiff. [Illustration: MARTEN TRAP TRIGGERS.] This trap is used heavy enough by some ""long line"" trappers for wolverine. They blacken bait and cover as shown in No. 4. In the two small illustrations the triggers are shown in No. 1 separate and in No. 2 set. A is the bait and trip stick, B the lever, C is the upright. B in No. 1 is where the bait should be. [Illustration: ANOTHER MARTEN DEADFALL.] In No. 3 A is bait, E is pin which fastens deadfall to under pole and prevents deadfall from turning to one side. F is post to keep under pole from bending. In No. 4 HH are nails which fasten down a springy piece of wood to keep cover over bait. Cover with fir or spruce boughs. * * * Another deadfall much used by marten trappers is constructed by cutting a notch in a tree about a foot in diameter, altho the size of the tree makes little difference. The notch should be four inches deep and a foot up and down and as high up as the trapper can cut--four or five feet. Only one pole is needed for this trap as the bottom of the notch cut answers for the bed or bottom piece. (See illustration.) The pole for the fall should be four inches or more in diameter and anywhere from six to ten feet in length, depending upon the place selected to set. The end fartherest from the bait or notched tree must be as high as the notch. This can be done by driving a forked stake into the ground or by tying that end of the pole to a small tree if there is one growing at the right place. [Illustration: HIGH BUILT MARTEN DEADFALL.] If the pole for the fall is larger than the notch is deep, the end must be flattened so that it will work easy in the notch, as a piece of wood has been nailed over the notch to hold the fall pole in place. The triggers used are generally the figure 4 and set with bait pointing as shown. There is no place for the marten to stand while eating bait, only in shelf, and of course when the spindle is pulled, down comes the pole killing the animal. [Illustration: TREE DEADFALL.] This shelf protects the bait and bed piece and the snow does not fill in between and require so much attention as the one first described. This deadfall may also be built on a stump with a small enclosure or pen and the two-piece trigger used. Most trappers place the bait or long trigger on bottom pole, when trapping for marten. It will be readily seen that a marten, to get the bait, will stand between the ""fall"" and bed or under pole and of course is caught while trying to get the bait. [Illustration: MORE MARTEN TRAP TRIGGERS.] The height that deadfalls for marten should be built depends upon how deep the snow gets. In the fall and early winter they can be built on the ground or logs and other fur-bearers are taken as well. A few inches of snow will not interfere with the workings of deadfalls on the ground, but deep snows will. To make catches the trapper must clean out under the fall pole each round. This is no small task. The trapper is always on the lookout for suitable places to construct Marten deadfalls. When the snows get several feet deep, and the trapper makes his rounds on snowshoes, the deadfalls constructed several feet above the ground are the ones that make the catches. CHAPTER V. STONE DEADFALLS. The stone deadfall here described is used by trappers wherever flat stones can be found and is a good trap to catch skunk, opossum, mink and other small game in. The trap is made as follows: The figure 4 trigger is best for this trap and is made after this manner: standard (1) is made by cutting a stick five or six inches long out of hard wood and whittling it to a flat point, but blunt at one end; (2) is about five inches long with a notch cut within about one and one-half inches of the end with the other end made square so that it will fit in (3) which is the bait stick. This is only a straight stick sixteen or eighteen inches long, while the other end of the stick should have a small prong on it, a tack driven in, or something to hold the bait in position. The best way will be to tie the bait on also. [Illustration: FLAT STONE TRAP.] After you have found a flat stone weighing from 50 to 100 pounds, depending upon what game you expect to trap, select the place for the trap, first place a small flat stone underneath so that your game will be killed quicker and also so that the upright trigger will not sink into the ground. Lift up the large, or upper stone, kneeling on one knee before the stone resting the weight of the stone on the other. This leaves both hands free to set the trap. This is done by placing the triggers in the position shown in illustration and then letting the stone down very easily on the triggers. You should keep your knee under the stone all the time until you see that it comes down easily and does not ""go off"" of its own weight. The bait should always be put on before the trap is set. This trap will go off easy and you must be careful that the bait you put on is not too heavy and will cause the trap to fall of its own accord. This trap can be made to catch rabbits which will come in handy to bait other traps for larger game. In trapping for rabbits bait with apples, cabbage, etc. This trap does not take long to make, as no pen need be built, the top stone is large enough to strike the animal, making no difference in what position it gets when after the bait. A stone two or three inches thick and say thirty inches across and the same length or a little longer is about the proper size for skunk, opossum, etc., but of course larger or smaller stones can be used--whatever you find convenient. * * * This trap consists of a flat piece of stone supported by three fits of wood, the whole trouble being in making these three fits right, and this can be done by carefully comparing the description here given with illustrations, whenever they are referred to. The parts are all made of wood about three-eighths of an inch thick. Fig. 1 is thirteen inches long, with notches about one-sixteenth of an inch deep cut in its upper side, two of the notches near together and at one end, and another four and a half inches from the first two. The latter notch should be cut a little sloping across the stick. [Illustration: STONE DEADFALL TRIGGERS.] Figure 1 represents a top view and the piece next below it is a side view of the piece of wood as it should be made, and end fartherest from the notches being trimmed to a point to hold the bait. This constitutes the trigger. The lever is shown in Fig. 2, the cut above giving a side view and that below it a bottom view of this part of the trap. The piece of wood needed for it is six and one-half inches long, one inch wide at one end, and tapering down to three-sixteenths of an inch at the other; a notch is cut across the under side one and a half inches from the wide end. Level off the upper side of the narrow end to about one-half the original thickness. If the flat stone to be used is a heavy one, the notch must not be more than 1 inch from the end; otherwise the leverage on the notches would be greater than is desirable, tending to hold the parts together too rigidly. The upright post, Fig. 3, is seven inches long, slightly forked at the bottom (to make it stand firm and prevent twisting round when in use), the upper end beveled from the front backwards at an angle of about 45 degrees. The front of the upright is the side that would face a person standing exactly opposite the trap when set. On the right side cut a long notch, half the width of the wood in depth, commencing the hollow slope of the notch one inch from the lower end and making the square shoulder just three inches from the bottom of the post; level the shoulder off from the front so as to leave only a narrow edge. Place the post upright, (see Fig. 4) it's forked end standing on a small piece of wood or flat stone, to prevent it from sinking into the ground; bait the pointed end of the trigger and hold it up horizontally with its middle notch, catching behind the shoulder of the notch in the upright post; then place the beveled end of the lever in the notch at the end of trigger, the notch in the lever laying on the edge of the top of the upright post. Lastly, make the stone rest on the top of the lever, arranging the stone so that the bait will be near the lower end of the stone. It is a good plan to hollow out the ground somewhat under where the stone falls, to allow a space for the pieces of the Fig. 4 to lay without danger of being broken. The bait, also, should be something that will flatten easily and not hard enough to tilt the stone up after it has fallen. The trouble with most deadfalls usually set, is in the weight of stone. When you get one heavy enough it will not trip easy when game takes hold, and oftentimes break head piece where the head takes hold of standard. The head piece from stone down to where standard sets in notch should be fully 2 1/4 inches, so when stone starts to fall it throws triggers out from under; otherwise, stone will catch and break them. [Illustration: THE INVITATION--SKUNK.] Young trappers when you are making triggers preparatory for your sets, tie each pair together separately as they are finished, then when you are ready to set there are no misfits. Now we are up to the bait stick. It should under no condition, be more than 9 inches long, and oftentimes shorter will answer better. A slotted notch on one end the width of triggers, and sharpened at the other, is all that is necessary. Then the bait will lay on the foundation of trap within 5 or 6 inches of front of the trap. Don't put bait away back under stone. You loose all the force when it falls. In building foundations for traps the utmost caution should be exercised in getting them good and solid. (See how well you can do it instead of how quick.) Begin in the fall before the trapping season is on, locate and build your trap, and be sure the top stone is plenty heavy, raise it up and let it fall several times. If it comes together with the bang of a wolf trap and will pinch a hair, so much the better. To illustrate: While squirrel shooting one morning in the fall of 1905, I was standing on a ledge where I used to trap for coons, and I happened to remember of a trap underneath me. I just thought I would see if it was there. I went down and kicked away the drifted leaves and found it intact and ready for business. When I lifted it up the foundation was as solid as the day I put it there, and that was in the fall of 1890, and I want to say right here that it took all the strength I had to set it. [Illustration: KILLED WITHOUT SCENTING ] Trappers, if you will try one or more of the above described deadfalls for those skunk, I think you can tie their pelts about your neck for protection cold mornings, and none will be the wiser as far as smell goes, provided, however, you put some obstruction to the right and left of the trap so it will compel his skunkship to enter direct in front, and then carefully adjust the length of bait stick so stone will crush him about the heart. I have taken quite a lot of skunk and very few ever scented where the head and heart were under stone, writes an Ohio trapper. I always had a preference for above described traps for many reasons, yet if you live where there is no stone, you are not in it. * * * Deadfalls come in handy sometimes and with no cost whatever--unless the cost is building them. Will send two illustrations of the stone deadfalls writes a successful deadfall trapper. Will say that there is a right and a wrong way to set the deadfall. If you want to make sure of your catch never set your deadfall flat with short triggers shaped like figure 4, but make long triggers instead and have the weight or choker sit almost upright and draw the top trigger close to the one that it rests on at the bottom. In this way you have a trap that will be very easy to touch off. [Illustration: RIGHT AND WRONG WAY.] The way that some set their deadfalls the animal can remove bait without being caught, simply because they draw the bait out from under the trap and stand far enough away to be out of danger of being caught. I can take a two hundred pound weight and set a deadfall that will catch a small field mouse but it would not do to have them knock that easy for you will get game that is too small to handle. CHAPTER VI. THE BEAR PEN. I will give a description of a bear pen, writes a Canadian trapper. The bottom of the floor is made first of two logs about (1-1) nine feet long and nine or ten inches thick. They are placed side by side as shown in cut and two other logs (2-2) nine feet long and eighteen inches in thickness are placed one on each side of the bottom logs. Then cut two short logs about twelve or fourteen inches thick and long enough to reach across the pen and extend about six inches over each side. Notch these down, as shown in cut (3-3) so that the top of the logs are about three or four inches higher than the sides. Cut notches in the top of these logs so that when logs 4-4 will lay solid on top of the other side logs. If they don't lie solid enough bore holes in the ends of the short logs and drive wooden pins in the holes. The top of the short logs and the inside of the long logs should be flattened and a short block (5) fitted loosely in one end, and the other end should be closed by a block driven down in notches cut in the sides of 4-4, as shown in small cut. The top of the block (6) should be about five inches lower than the top of the side logs. Notches are next cut in the side logs, directly over this block, so that when the roller (7) is in place, it will fit down snugly on this block. The roller is about five inches thick and should turn easily in the notches. [Illustration: BEAR PEN TRAP.] The next step is to make the lid. It should be made of two logs of such a size that they will entirely close the top of the trap. They are notches down and pinned onto the roller and block 5. These logs should project over rear end of pen about four or five feet. Before pinning these logs in places, a hole should be made for the bait stick, half of it being cut in each log. Pins should be driven in the side logs, over the roller, so that the bear cannot raise the lid. Two crotches are then cut and set up at the sides of the trap and spiked solid to the sides. A short pole is then placed in the crotches and a long pole, running lengthwise of the trap, is fastened to the lid at one end with wire and the other ends fits into a notch in the bait stick when the trap is set. The bait stick has a spike driven thru it on the inside of the trap to keep it from pulling thru. To set the trap, pile stones on the end of the lid until it will tip easily, then put a pole thru under lid and go inside and fasten the bait on the bait stick. Then pull the long pole down and hook it into the notch in the bait stick. Remove the stones from lid and take the pole from under it and the trap is set and ready for the first bear that comes along. If the lid does not seem heavy enough, pile stone on it. A trap of this kind may be made by two men in half a day and will be good for a number of years. * * * The log trap is one of the very best methods of taking the bear, it beats the deadfall all to nothing, says an old and experienced Ohio bear trapper. It is a sure shot every time; I have never known it to fail except where the pen had stood for a number of years and become rotten. In a case of that kind the bear would have no difficulty in gnawing his way out. This trap or pen, as I shall call it, has been time tried and bear tested. My father used to make these traps and many is the time when a boy I have ridden on horseback upon a narrow path, cut for the purpose of letting a horse pass along and on nearing the pen heard the growling and tearing around of the bear in the pen and the hair on my head would almost crowd my hat off. Go about building it this way: First select the spot where you have reason to believe that bear inhabit; now having made your selection, get a level place and on this spot lay a course of logs with the top flattened off; this may be eight by three feet. This being done, commence to lay up the house of logs six to eight inches in diameter. Three sides of each log should be flattened; these will be the top, bottom and the inside. It is necessary this be done, for they must fit closely together in order that the bear cannot get a starting place to gnaw. This is why I suggest that the inside of the log be flattened. It is a well-known fact that you can put any gnawing animal into a square box and he cannot gnaw out for he cannot get the starting point. Lay a short log first, then a long one, notching each corner as you go so the logs will fit closely together. Now for the front corners; drive a flattened stake into the ground, letting the flattened side come against the logs. Now as you proceed to lay on a course of logs pin thru the stake into each log. Now go on up until you get a height of about four feet, then lay on, for the top, a course of short logs commencing at the back end. Between the second and third logs cut out a little notch and flatten the under side of this log around the notch; this is to receive the trigger, which is made of a small pole about three inches thick. Put this into the hole and let it come down within ten inches of the floor. Then cut a notch in the side facing the front of the pen and so it will fit up against the under side of the leg with the notch in; now you may make a notch in the trigger about six inches above the top of the pen and on the same side of the trigger that the first notch was made. Now the trigger is ready except adjusting the bait. [Illustration: BEAR ENTERING PEN.] Next lay a binder on top of the pen and upon either end of the short course of logs; pin the binders at either end so the bear cannot raise the top off the pen. You may also lay on three or four logs to weight it down and make it doubly sure. You may pin the first short top log in front to the side logs to keep the front of the pen from spreading. Now we have the body of the pen complete. The door is the next thing in order. The first or bottom log ought to be twelve feet long, but it is not necessary for the balance of them to be that length; flatten the top and bottom of each log so they will lie tight together, also flatten off the inside of the door so it will work smoothly against the end of the pen. Lay the logs of the door onto the first or long log, putting a pin in each end of the logs as you lay them on. Go on this way until you have enough to reach the height of the pen and fully cover the opening. Another way of fastening the door together is to get the logs all ready, then lay them upon the ground and pin two pieces across the door. Either way will do. Now the door being in readiness, put it in its place and drive two stakes in the ground to keep the animal from shoving the door away. If these do not appear to be solid enough to support the door against an onslaught, you may cut a notch in the outside of the stake near the top; get a pole eight feet in length, sharpen the ends, letting one end come in the notch of the stake and the other into the ground; this will hold the door perfectly solid. Cut a slight notch in the top log of the door for the end of the spindle and the next move is to raise the door to the proper height. Set a stud under the door to keep it from falling. Get your spindle ready, flatten the top of either end a little, then cut a stanchion just the right length to set under the spindle on the first top log. Tie your bait onto the lower end of the trigger, one man going inside to put the trigger in the proper place. To facilitate the springing of the trap, lay a small round stick in the upper notch of the trigger, letting the end of the spindle come up under the stick and as the bear gets hold of the meat on the bottom of the trigger the least pull will roll the trigger from the end of the spindle. However, it will spring very easily as the stanchion under the end of the spindle is so near the end. This kind of trap can be made by two men in one day or less, and it often happens that the hunter and trapper wants to set a trap for bear a long way from any settlement or road. The carrying of a fifty pound bear trap a distance of twenty or thirty miles is no little task. Then again, this trap costs nothing but a little time and the trapper's whole life is given over to time. One man can make this trap alone and set it, but it is better for two to work together in this work, for in case the door should spring upon him while he was inside he would be forever lost. I have caught two wildcats at once in this pen, but it is not to be expected that you will get more than one bear or other large animal at a time. CHAPTER VII. PORTABLE TRAPS. In describing a portable deadfall, an Indiana trapper writes as follows: We took a piece of sawed stuff 2 x 4, say 5 feet long, then another the same size and length. For upright pieces to hold the main pieces so one would fall square on the other, we used sawed stuff 1 x 3, two pieces set straight up and down at each end, or about far enough to leave the back end stick out three inches, and front end or end where the triggers set, 6 inches. Nail these 1 x 3 two on each end as directed above, nail to lower piece 2 x 4 only, then at back end bore a hole through the two uprights and also upper 2 x 4, or the piece that falls, put a bolt through, or a wood pin if the hole in the 2 x 4 is larger than those through the uprights; then you are ready to raise it up and let it ""drop"" to see whether it works smoothly or not. Better nail a block 2 x 4 between the tops of the uprights to keep them from spreading apart, then it is ready all except the triggers and string for them to run against. It is portable, you can pick it up and move it anywhere, only a stake or two needed driven down on each side. Where string is shown as tied to little bush should be a small stake. [Illustration: DEN SET DEADFALL.] * * * ""SHEAR TRAP."" I send a drawing of a trap called the ""Shear Trap,"" writes an Eastern trapper. This is not a new trap, neither is it my own invention. I have used this style and can recommend it to be O. K., cheap, easy made, light to move, will last and will catch most any small animal. This trap is made as follows: Take 4 strips of board 4 feet 4 inches long, by 3 inches wide. Bore one inch hole two inches from end of all four of them. Now make two rounds about 13 inches long and put two of the boards on each side of the round. At the other end put the two middle boards on the other round (see illustration). Make one other round fifteen inches long, same size as the others. Put the two outside boards on it, forming two separate frames at the other end--so the two inside boards can turn on the round to which they are coupled. [Illustration: PORTABLE WOODEN TRAP.] Take two strips three inches wide, two feet and six inches long. Bore one inch hole two inches from the top end and put round broom stick thru it seventeen inches long. Fasten all the rounds by wedges or small wooden pins. Stand the two strips last mentioned on the outside of the frame at the end they separate and make them fast so as to stand perpendicular. For bait stick take lathe or one-half inch board one inch wide. Bore hole as shown in cut (figure 6) cut notch (figure 2). For trigger any stick 18 inches long, 5/8 inch thick will do: tie string 2 inches from end and tie other end at figure 1, pass the short end under round from the outside (figure 3) and catch in notch in bait lath (figure 2), the other end bait at figure 4. Put weight at figure 5. Cover trap at figure 6 to keep animal from going in from back up to figure 7. For bait I use fresh fish, muskrat, bird, etc., and scent with honey or blood. * * * THE BARREL TRAP. I promised in my last letter to describe the barrel trap, says a Northwestern trapper, which I use for capturing rats. Other trappers may have used this trap for years, but I only mean this for the young trappers who know nothing about this trap. Take any kind of an old barrel made of hard wood (a salt barrel makes a good one), and fix a board on one side of the top with a hinge. Let one end of the barrel project out directly over the barrel to within about 5 or 6 inches of the other side. Arrange it so that the end of the board not over the barrel is a little the heaviest so when the rat tilts down the end in the barrel it will come back to place again. Place a bit of parsnip apple, or celery near the end of the board over the barrel so when the rat reaches his front feet over on the board it will tilt down and let him in the barrel to stay. Bury the barrel near a river or creek to within about 2 or 3 inches of top of barrel, so there will be from 6 inches to 1 foot of water in the barrel. If there is much water in the barrel the most of the rats will be dead when you visit your traps. Several may be captured in one night in this kind of a trap. * * * BLOCK TRAP. Saw a small log in blocks from 4 to 6 inches long. Bore an inch hole through the center. Take nails and drive them so that they form a ""muzzle"" in one end and have the nails very sharp. Fasten your blocks with a piece of wire and put it in the runway or on a log or anywhere that a coon will see it, and nine out of ten will put his foot into it. I bait with honey. I caught 75 or 80 coons this season with ""block"" snares. I put stoppers or false bottoms in one end of the block, piece of corn cob or anything will do. Cut the foot off to get the animal out of this snare. [Illustration: THE BLOCK TRAP.] The illustration shows a square block with the hole bored in the side. This is done to better show how it should be done, although when set, the hole should be up. Bait with a piece of fresh rabbit, frog, or anything that coon are fond of. Instead of the blocks the auger hole can be bored in a log or root of a tree if a suitable one can be found where coon frequent. * * * THE ""NOXEMALL"" DEADFALL. The best material is spruce, but if spruce is not to be had, hard wood is better than soft. Follow directions closely; never use old, dozy wood; good, sound, straight-grained material is the cheapest to use. A good way to get your material is to go to the saw-mill, select good straight-grained 2 x 4 studding, have them ripped lengthwise again, making four strips out of the original 2 x 4, each strip being two inches wide by one inch thick; then have them cut in the lengths--two standards (A), 14 inches long; (B) two side pieces, 2 1/2 feet long; (C) two drop bars, 2 1/2 feet. Bore a hole in each piece with a one inch bit, two inches from the end of the piece to the center of the hole. (D) A piece of lath about 8 inches long, with one end beveled off to fit in slot of E; tie a piece of small rope, about a foot long, two inches from the other end. (E) A piece of lath, 2 1/2 feet long, with a slot cut crosswise two inches from one end and a piece of rope tied two inch from the other end, about a foot long. [Illustration: THE NOX-EM-ALL DEADFALL.] If you get your material at the mill have four rounds (F) turned out of oak or maple (must be hard wood), three of them being 12 inches long, one being 8 inches long, 7/8 inch in diameter. They must be some smaller than the hole, as they swell when wet. Your trap is now ready to put together. Take one 12 inch round slip on the side pieces B first, then the two standards A; next place a 12 inch round in the holes in the top of the standards. The front end of the trap is done, except fastening the standards to the round and the setting apparatus to the top round of standards. Next take the remaining 12 inch round slip on the drop bars C first, then the side pieces B outside; next place the short round G in the front end of drop bar C. You can drive nails thru the outside pieces and the round. Where there are two pieces on a side on one round, fasten thru the outside piece, always leaving the inside piece loose so that it will turn on the round. A much better way, altho it is more work, is to bore a hole thru the side piece and round and drive in a hard wood plug. This is the best way, because if any part of the trap breaks you can knock out the plug much easier than to pull out a nail. The holes should be bored with a 1/4 inch bit. Tie the rope attached to E to the rear round, leaving two inches play, between E and the round. Tie the rope attached to D to the top round of standards, leaving two inches play at top and two inches between lower end of D and bottom round. First place a stone on the drop bar, weighing 20 pounds. Then raise the drop bar high enough so that you can place the short lath under the round of drop so that the weight rests on the rope. These is the secret of setting. The pressure on top forces the lower end to fly up. Now place the beveled end of the short lath in the slot of the long lath and the trap is set. Hang your bait from the drop bars, under the weight, about eight inches from the front. The game will then come to the side of the trap. Never tie bait on the lath. Set the trap in front of the hole, block up by setting up two stones V shape on the upper side of hole, forcing game thru the trap to enter or come out. CHAPTER VIII. SOME TRIGGERS. During my trapping experiences I remember of visiting an old trapper's deadfalls and at that time I had never seen or used any trigger other than the figure 4, but this trapper used the prop and spindle. I looked at several of his traps; in fact, went considerably out of my way to look at some eight or ten of them. Two of these contained game--a skunk and opossum. I had often heard of these triggers, but was skeptical about them being much good. I now saw that these triggers were all right and on visiting my traps again set a few of them with these triggers. Since that time I have never used the figure 4. The prop and spindle I know will look to many too hard to ""go off,"" but they can be set so that they will go off fairly easy. It is not necessary that the trap be set so that the least touch will make it go off. It is best to have the trap set so that mice nibbling at bait will not throw it. Trappers who have never used the deadfall will, no doubt, find that after they use them a short time and become better acquainted with their construction and operation that they will catch more game than at first. This is only natural as all must learn from experience largely, whether at trapping or anything else. The prop is a straight piece about seven inches long and about one-half inch in diameter. The spindle, or long trigger, is about the size of the prop, but should be sixteen or eighteen inches long with a prong cut off within two inches of the end to help hold the bait on more securely. See cut elsewhere showing these triggers and of the figure likewise. These illustrations will give a better idea of how the triggers are made to those who have never seen or used them. * * * I saw some time ago where a brother wanted to know how to make a deadfall, writes an Illinois trapper. I send a picture of one that I think is far ahead of any that I have seen in the H-T-T yet, that is, the triggers. I have seen deadfall triggers that would catch and not fall when the bait was pulled at, but there is no catch to these. Trigger No. 1 is stub driven in the ground with a notch cut in the upper end for end of bait. Stick No. 5 to fit in No. 3 is another stub driven in ground for bait stick No. 5 to rest on top. No. 3 is a stick, one end laid on top of bait stick outside of stub No. 2, the other end on top of lower pole. No. 4 is the prop stick. One end is set on stick No. 3 about one inch inside the lower pole the other end underneath the upper pole. The X represents the bait. When the bait stick is pulled out of notch in stub No. 1, the upper pole comes down and has got your animal. [Illustration: ILLINOIS TRAPPER'S TRIGGERS.] If you find your bait is caught between the poles you may know the bait is not back in the box far enough. If you find the trap down and bait and bait stick gone, you may know that the bait is too far back. The animal took his whole body in before he pulled the bait. I have tried to describe this trap for the ones that don't know how to make a deadfall. Somebody wants to know how to make a good deadfall. Well the plans published in back numbers of H-T-T are all right except the figure four sticks and bait. Make your sticks like this, and you will be pleased with the way they work, says an experienced trapper. [Illustration: TRIP TRIGGERS.] No. 2 flat view. The trigger sets in the slanting cut in side of No. 2. Don't put bait on trigger. Put it in back end of pen and pin it to the ground. Turn trigger across opening slanted slightly in, then you get them by neck or shoulders. The longer the slot in the trigger, the harder they will trip. Set as straight up as possible. Make 1 and 2 of hard wood. Saw a block 3 1/2 inches long and split into 3/4 inch squares. Make cuts square with a saw and split out the part you don't want. Bevel ends with a hatchet. Make trigger of green hard wood stick with bark on. * * * I cut a tree from 8 to 10 inches in diameter and cut off 7 feet long. Split the piece open and bury one piece on a level with the earth--split side up--and place the other half on top. I hew off any bumps and make a perfect fit. Then I cut out bushes the size of my arm, and drive them down on each side of my fall and leave them an inch or two higher than I expect my top log to be when set. Be sure to begin far enough at the back to force the animals to go in at the front. I use the figure four triggers and tie the bait to the long trigger. Another trigger is made as follows: Cut two forks and lay pole across just in front of the log on top of the forks. Take another piece of timber about four feet long, tie a string to each end and let one end have a trigger and the other be tied on your top log. I drive a nail in the top log and tie the string to it, and I call this my Fly trigger. It acts as a lever, for when the fly comes up over the piece on the forks and the trigger goes over half way back by the side of the log, and the trigger about a foot long--straight and thin, and sticks under the log--have a short trigger tied to the fly pole and a forked sapling the size of your finger and long enough to stick in the ground to hold the trigger. Put the bait on long trigger and catch the short trigger through the fork and let it catch the long trigger. This trigger leaves the fall open in front and is the one I prefer. Take two small logs about 10 or 12 feet long, large enough to break a coon's back, and make a pen about midway, or one-third from front end, to put the bait in, and the trigger. Two foot boards, or saplings will do, and make the pen so that the animal will have to step across the bottom log and take the bait, and be sure to set so that the top log will fall across the mink, coon, skunk, or opossum, as they are the animals I kill with the fall. Use fly pole triggers as above, for this deadfall. I make these falls near the runways of the animals I wish to catch. When I am sure to stay at a place, I build my falls in the summer and by the trapping time they look old and natural. CHAPTER IX. TRIP TRIGGERS. The deadfall shown here can be used at dens or in paths where animals travel frequently. When set across the entrance of dens it will catch an animal going in without bait. That is, it will catch an animal going in, as the triggers are so constructed that they can only be pushed towards the bait as shown in illustration. If the trap is to be used at dens without bait the regular figure 4 triggers had best be used, but set extending along the log instead of back into the pen. An animal in entering will strike the trigger and down comes the fall. The trap shown here and the triggers are made as follows: Cut two logs and lay one on the ground. This log should be at least four feet long. Place it firmly on the ground with flat side up. This log need not be as flat as shown in illustration, but should be flattened slightly. Drive two stakes three feet long within a foot or so of one end (8) and (9). Now come to the other end and drive two more (10) and (11). Stake ten which is directly opposite from (11) you want to be careful not to split, as one of the triggers rests on it. The fall is now placed in position, that is the upper log. The end of this is split and a stake driven in the ground so that the fall will not turn between the stakes but is held firmly. See that the fall will work easily up and down; that the stakes are not so close together that the fall binds, yet it wants to fit snugly. [Illustration: ANIMAL ENTERING TRIP DEADFALL.] Cut trip stick (4) and trigger (3), lifting the fall up with one knee and place end of (3) onto (4) slightly, so that a small pressure on (4) will spring the trap. After you have the trap set spring it to see that it works all right. If the trap works all right and you are setting across the entrance of a den the pen of course is not wanted. If you are setting in paths or near dens, drive stakes in a semi-circle as shown in illustration, but the stakes should stick above the ground some eighteen inches or about as high as the ""fall"" pole when set. It is a good plan to throw leaves or grass on the stakes. A small notch (5) should be cut in upright post (8) for trip stick to fit in to hold it up to that end. Be careful, however, that this notch is not cut too deep. The bait (6) is placed back in the pen and fastened with wire or a stake driven thru it into the ground. The open space over bait is now covered over and the entire trap can be made to not look so suspicious by cutting brush and throwing over it excepting in front of the bait. An animal in going in for bait steps on or pushes the long stick (marked 4 at one end and 5 at the other) off of (3) and is usually caught. * * * This is another good trip trigger deadfall. A short log should be laid on the ground and the two stakes driven opposite each other as in the trap just described. These stakes are not shown, as a better view of the triggers and workings of the trap can be had by omitting these. In the illustration the ""fall"" pole is weighted, but it is best to have the pole heavy enough and not weighted. The stakes on which the upper or cross piece is nailed should be from twelve to eighteen inches apart. The cross piece need not be heavy, yet should be strong so that the weight of the fall will not bend it. [Illustration: TRIP TRIGGER FALL.] The pens or enclosures used cannot be covered, as this would interfere with the workings of the triggers. If the pen is sixteen inches or higher very few animals will climb over to get bait, but will go in where the trapper wants and if properly made and set are apt to catch the game. * * * Along in the late seventies or beginning of the eighties, when a good sized muskrat would bring about as much as a common prime mink, and a steel trap was quite a prize to be in possession of, I had perhaps two dozen traps, some old fashioned, that would be quite a curiosity at present, besides a few Newhouse No. 0 and 1. That was in Ontario, Canada. Skunk, mink, coon, muskrat and fox were the furs in that part, Waterloo, Brant and Oxford Counties. Later I used this deadfall with success in Iowa and other sections, so that there is no doubt but that it will be found a good fur catcher in most localities. I used to catch a great deal with deadfalls,--picture of which I here enclose. I have seen nearly all the different makes of deadfalls and have tried some of them, but the one I here send you the picture of, which can be easily understood, is the one I have had the most success with. I believe they are the best, and an animal can't get at the bait without striking it off, besides some animals will examine a bait without touching it. This deadfall, if they are curious enough just to enter inside and put their foot on the trigger stick, they are yours if the trap is set properly. [Illustration: CANADIAN TRIP FALL.] This style of deadfall can be successfully, used over skunk holes, game runways and there you do away with the bait yard. This style of trap is much easier made, as it requires very little skill. Just a few straight sticks about the size round of a cane, a little twine. You can catch most any animal from a weasel to a raccoon. The illustration shows the ""fall"" or upper pole weighted. In our experience we have found it more satisfactory to have the ""fall"" heavy enough to kill the animal without the weight. It is often hard for the trapper to find a pole of the right size and weight for the ""fall"" and the next best way is to place additional weight as shown. * * * First make a pen in the form of a wigwam, driving stakes well into the ground to keep the animal away from the rear of the trap. It should be open on one side. Place a short log in front of the opening and at both ends of this drive stakes to hold it in place and for the long log to work up and down in. The top log should be six or eight feet long, according to size of animal you aim to use trap for, and about the same size as the bottom log. Cut a forked stick about 12 inches long for the bait stick, notching one end and tapering the other as shown in Fig. No. 2. A stick 24 inches long should then be cut and flattened at both ends. [Illustration: THE TURN TRIGGER.] To set the trap, raise one end of the upper log and stick one end of the flattened stick under it, resting it upon the top of the stake on the outside of the log. Place the bait stick, point downward, inside the pen upon a chip of wood or rock to keep it from sinking into the ground and set flat stick in the notch. When the animal pulls at the bait it turns the bait stake and throws the cross piece out of the notch of the bait stick and let the top log fall. CHAPTER X. HOW TO SET. In explaining size pen some make them 2 feet long, writes a New York trapper, while one 12 inches long (as used on this trail), is sufficient; not only that, but it is superior for the following reasons: A 2 foot pen would let the animal pass inside and beyond the drop when sprung, unless the animal stepped on the treddle. The Indians' trap is made by cutting a sapling 3 or 4 inches in diameter off the butt end cut a piece 2 foot and place on the ground for a bed piece; drive four stakes, two on either side of bed piece, leaving a space between of 12 inches, using the balance of pole for the drop to play between the stakes. For balance of pen a few stakes, bark or slabs cut from a tree. For a spindle, cut from a hemlock, spruce or other dry limb a piece eight or ten inches long, sharpen one end to a point, the other end flatten a trifle for an inch or two on the underside, so that when placed on the bed piece it will lay steady. Now with a sharp knife, commence 1/2 inch back, and round off top side of spindle on which to place a standard four inches in length, cut from same material as spindle. In setting, place the bait on the spindle so as to leave a space of only six inches from bait to the standard; now take spindle in left hand, standard in right hand, kneel down, raise the drop placing one knee under it to hold it up the right height. Lay spindle onto center of bed piece and place the standard on top of spindle, letting drop rest on top of standard so as to keep the pieces in position. Now by moving the standard out or in on the spindle, the spring of the trap can be so gauged that it will set safely for weeks or months, sprung easily, and hold anything from a weasel to a raccoon. It is sure, as it kills immediately, giving them no chance to escape by twisting or gnawing off their legs. It is not so quickly made and set as a steel trap, and never gives ""Sneakums"" inducements to approach it for future use. After the trap is set, place bark or something suitable between the stakes above the drop and cover top of pen so as to compel the animal to enter in front, and at the same time ward off snow and sleet from interfering with its workings. Weight the drop pole on either side of pen by placing on chunks of wood or stone. * * * There are several ways to set deadfalls, as different triggers are used. The manner in constructing these traps is varied somewhat in the different sections. The illustration shown here is of a trap that is used to a considerable extent in all parts of America. The trapper for marten in the far North, the opossum trapper of West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, the skunk trapper of the New England States and the mink trapper of the west have all used this trap with success. It is for the hundreds of young and inexperienced trappers that the deadfall is shown here. [Illustration: TWO PIECE TRIGGER TRAP.] The trigger as shown, that is the one extending back into the pen, is all one piece. This trigger is usually cut from a bush and often requires some time to find one suited. If you intend to build a few traps of this kind it is well to be on the lookout in advance for suitable triggers. This trap is set with only two triggers, the one with the straight part extending back into the pen and the prong on which the ""fall"" is resting and the other trigger is driven into the ground so that it is only a little higher than the under log of the trap. This trap can be set with the triggers known as figure 4 if preferred. Coon, mink, opossum, skunk and marten are usually not hard to catch in deadfalls, although now and then an animal for some reason is extremely hard to catch. In building deadfalls it is best to split the end of the pole fartherest from the pen or bait and drive the stake there. This will hold the upper or ""fall"" pole solid, so that there will be no danger of its turning of its own weight and falling. * * * I enclose plan and description of a deadfall I have used with success on skunk and other fur animals, writes a trapper from New York State. Never having seen anything like it described I thought it might be a help to those using these traps. During November and December, 1897, I caught 11 skunk in one deadfall like this one. [Illustration: STRING AND TRIGGER TRAP.] Stakes are driven in the ground to form the pen same as on figure 4 or other deadfall, but no brush or sticks should be laid on top of pen as it would prevent the vertical stick from lifting up, A small log or board with stones on may be laid on pole for more weight. The pole may be from ten to fifteen feet long and about three inches in diameter. AA 18 inches or more out of the ground and one-half inch in diameter; B 20 inches, X one-half inch; C about 16 X 3/4 inches; D 20 X 3/4 inches; E same as AA only not crotch; F 1/4 inch. Rope long enough to go around pole and over B and tie around C. D should be from 1 to 3 inches above ground according to what is being trapped. Bait should be laid on ground or fastened to stake near middle of pen. CHAPTER XI. WHEN TO BUILD. If you have determined upon your trapping ground it is best to build your traps in advance of the trapping season, so that they will become old and weather beaten. This, of course, is not necessary as traps are often built, baited and on the return of the trapper the following morning game securely caught. While the above is often true, deadfalls can and should be built in advance of the trapping season. There are at least two reasons for this: first, it allows the traps to become weather beaten and game is not so suspicious; second, all the trapper has to do when the trapping season arrives is to visit and set his traps. Some object to deadfalls on the ground that they require lots of work to build and that a trapper's time is valuable at this season of the year. Such may be true of the amateur, but the professional trapper usually has much idle time in August, September and early October, when he is glad to look out for trapping grounds for the coming winter. It is a day's work for one man to build from eight to twelve deadfalls, depending of course upon how convenient he finds the pole to make the fall. The other material is usually not hard to find or make. That is stakes, chunks and rocks. If you only build six or eight traps and construct them right they are worth twice as many poorly built. When properly built they will last for years, requiring but little mending each fall at the opening of the trapping season. Taken all in all we do not know that a certain number of deadfalls take up any more time than an equal number of steel traps. In fact more deadfalls can be set in a day, after they are built, than steel traps. When it is stated that you will perhaps do as well at home as elsewhere, this, of course, depends upon where you are located, how many trappers there are in your section, etc. If there is but little to be caught then you had best go elsewhere, but trappers have been known in thickly settled sections to catch from $50 to $300 worth of fur in a season, lasting from November 1 to March 15. Of course in the far north, where trapping can be carried on from October 15 to June 15, or eight months, the catch is much larger, and as the animals caught are more valuable, the catch of a single trapper is sometimes as high as $600 to $1,000. The trapper who stays near home has the advantage of knowing the territory. If he was to visit a strange section, altho a good trapping locality, he would not do so well as if he were acquainted with the locality and knew the locations of the best dens. Then again his expenses are heavier if he goes into a strange section, yet If there is but little game near your home, and you are going to make a business of trapping, go and look up a good trapping section. Under these conditions it is best for two or three to go together. There is no necessity of carrying but little baggage other than your gun, for at the season of the year that prospecting is done there is but little difficulty in killing enough game to live on. After you have once found a good trapping section, and built your cabin, deadfalls and snares, you can go there fall after fall with your line of steel traps, resetting your deadfalls with but little repairs for years. You will also become better acquainted with the territory each season and will make larger catches. Do not think that you have caught all the game the first season, for generally upon your return the next fall you will find signs of game as numerous as ever. In locating new trapping grounds, if two or three are together and it is a busy time in September, let one of the party go in advance prospecting. This will save much valuable time when you make the start for the fall and winter trapping campaign. It will pay you to know where you are going before you make the final start. CHAPTER XII. WHERE TO BUILD. In determining where to set deadfalls or locate snares if you will keep in mind the dens where each winter you have caught fur-bearing animals, or their tracks have often been seen in the snow or mud, and build your traps and construct snares at or near such places you are pretty sure to not go astray. The location, of course, depends largely upon what kind of game you are trying to catch. If mink or coon, there is no better place than along streams where there are dens. If there should be a small branch leading off from the main stream, at the mouth of this is often an excellent place to locate a trap. It should not be too near the water as a rise would damage or perhaps float off at least part of your trap. Sometimes farther up this small stream there are bluffs and rocks; at such places, if there are dens, is just the place to build deadfalls. If there are several dens, and the bluff extends along several hundred feet, it perhaps will pay to build two or three traps here. In cleared fields, woods or thickets skunk are found anywhere that there are dens you can construct a trap. While, as a rule, the thinly settled districts are the best trapping sections, yet skunk, muskrat and red fox are found in greatest numbers in settled sections, while opossum, raccoon and mink are found in fairly well settled districts. It is therefore not necessary that you should go to the wilderness to make fairly good catches. While the trapper in the wilderness has the advantage of no one disturbing his deadfalls, yet he has disadvantages. The trapper who means business need not go hundreds of miles away, but if he will build a line of traps along some stream where there are mink, or in the thickets and along rocky buffs for skunk, raccoon, opossum, etc., he will be surprised at results. In some sections land owners may not allow trapping, but usually they will, especially if you take the pains to ask before you commence building or setting your traps. The fact that you have your traps scattered over a large territory gives you better chances of making good catches, for most animals travel quite a distance from night to night. You may have traps at some stream that is eight or ten miles from your home and a mink may come along that does most of its seeking for food miles farther up or down this stream, nearer, perhaps, where it was raised, and you get him. Thus you see by going only ten miles away you may catch animals that really live twenty. Just how far a mink may travel up or down a creek or river I do not know, but it is certain that they go many miles and traps may make a catch of a mink that lives many, many miles away. Of course along small streams they may not go so far. Often, however, they continue their travels from one stream to another. If you are an expert trapper you can very easily detect, if you are in a good locality, especially if in the fall--September and October. These are the two months when the most prospecting is done. Going along streams at this season tracks are plainly seen and in the forests at dens signs, such as hair, bones and dung. Often you will come upon signs where some bird has been devoured and you know that some animal has been in the locality. Old trappers readily detect all these signs and new ones can learn by experience. It is not absolutely necessary to build traps at or near dens. Some years ago, I remember when doing considerable trapping in Southern Ohio, I came upon a deadfall built near a small stream that ran thru a woods. I looked around for dens, but saw none. Why this trap had been built there was a puzzle to me. One day I happened upon the owner of the trap and asked him what he expected to catch in that trap. In reply he pointed to a bush some rods distant in which hung the carcasses of two opossum and one coon--caught in the trap. While there were no dens near, it was a favorite place for animals to cross or else they came there for water. This same trap was the means of this old trapper taking two or three animals each winter, while other traps at dens near caught less. There is much in knowing where to set traps, but keep your eyes open for signs and you will learn where to build traps and set snares sooner or later. * * * Yes, boys, the deadfall is a splendid trap if made right, says an Arkansas trapper. I will tell you how to make one that will catch every mink and coon that runs the creek. Take a pole four feet long and four inches through, next get a log six inches through and eight feet long. Use eight stakes and two switches. Use the figure four trigger, but the notches are cut different. Both of the notches are cut on the top side of the long trigger and a notch cut in the upright trigger and down the long trigger. The paddle part is sixteen inches long. When the trap is set the paddle wants to be level and one-half inch higher than small logs, then your two switches comes in this to keep the paddle from hitting the bark on side logs. [Illustration: TRAIL OR DEN TRAP.] Next is where to set. If along a creek, find a place where the water is within three feet of the bank, set your trap up and down the creek at edge of water, dam up from back end of paddle to bank with brush or briars, then from front end into water three or four feet. You will find the upright trigger has to be a good deal longer than the notch trigger. You can use round triggers if you want to by nailing a shingle five inches wide on the long trigger stick. Be sure and have your paddle muddy if setting along creeks. You want to put a little stone back beyond paddle, so when the trap falls it will not burst paddle. Now you have a trap easy made and sure to catch any animal that steps on paddle, which is five inches wide and sixteen long. You don't need any bait, but you can use bait by throwing it under paddle. This trap is hard to beat for small game. * * * I make a deadfall that sets without bait, writes an Illinois trapper. It is made like any other only different triggers. Set it across path, over or in front of den or remove a rail and set it in the corner of a fence where game goes thru. Use thread in dry weather, fine wire for wet. Two logs for bottom is better than one, make triggers high enough to suit the animal you wish to catch; if he hits the string or wire he is yours. CHAPTER XIII. THE PROPER BAIT. Bait is sometimes difficult to get, but usually the trapper will get enough with his gun and steel traps to keep his line of deadfalls well baited, without difficulty. In trapping, all animals caught after the pelt is taken off should be hung up so that other animals cannot reach them, but will visit your traps. There are two objects in hanging up bait: First, other animals coming along are apt to eat them and not visit your deadfall; second, should you run out of bait you can cut a piece from the animal hanging up, bait your trap and go to the next. While bait of this kind is not recommended, sometimes it comes to this or nothing. Fresh bait is what is wanted at all times, yet the trapper cannot always get what he knows is best and consequently must do the next best. Perhaps by his next visit he has bait in abundance. The writer has known trappers to use a piece of skunk, opossum, muskrat, coon, etc., that had been caught some weeks before and hung up in a sapling where it froze and on the next visit the trap baited with skunk contained a skunk. This shows that when an animal is very hungry it is not very particular what it eats. In the early fall while food of all kinds is easy to find, any animal is harder to entice to bait and at this season bait should be fresh if the trapper expects to make profitable catches. The trapper should always carry a gun, pistol or good revolver with which to help kill game to supply bait for his traps. Steel traps set along the line will also help to keep the supply of bait up at all times. If you are successful in securing a great deal of bait, more than will be used on that round, you will find it an excellent idea to leave some at certain places where it can be secured on the next round should it be needed. Bait may consist of any tough bit of meat, but rabbit is an excellent bait. Quail or almost any bird is good. Chicken also makes good bait. Squirrel is all right. For mink, fish is excellent. Mice, frogs and muskrat can all be used. Remember that the fresher and bloodier the bait the better--animals will scent it much quicker. They are also fonder of fresh bait than that which has been killed for days or weeks as the case may be. In baiting it is important to see that the bait is on secure. It is a good idea to tie it on with strong thread or small cord. The amount of bait to put on a single trap is not so important. Most trappers use a rabbit in baiting ten traps or less; the head makes bait for one trap, each foreleg another, the back about three and each hind leg one, altho each hind leg can be cut to make bait for two traps. The spindle or trigger is run thru the bait and should be fastened on trigger near the end as shown in illustration elsewhere. The securing of bait on the trigger is an important thing. If it is not on securely and the trap is hard to get off, the animal may devour bait and the trap not fall. If the trigger is only sticking loosely in the bait, it is easy for an animal to steal the bait. Usually the observing trapper knows these things and are on their guard, but for those who are using deadfalls this season for the first time, more explicit explanation is necessary. The bait should extend back into the pen about a foot and the pen should be so constructed that the bait touches nowhere only on the trigger. The animal in eating the bait usually stands with its fore feet upon the under pole, or just over it. In this condition it can readily be seen, that if its gnawing at the bait twists the trigger off the upright prop what the consequences will be--the animal will be caught across the back. An animal standing in the position just described will naturally pull down somewhat on the bait and in its eagerness to get the bait pulls and twists the spindle, or trigger, off the upright prop. It is a good idea to try the trigger. That is, place the triggers under the fall just the same as you would if they were baited and you were going to set the trap. By doing this you will find out about how you want to set the triggers so that they will work properly. There is much in being acquainted with the working of traps. Study them carefully and you will soon learn to be a successful trapper. CHAPTER XIV. TRAPS KNOCKED OFF. If you find that your traps are ""down"" each time you visit them and the bait gone, the pen is perhaps too large and the animal, if a small one like a mink, is going inside to devour bait. Animals usually stand with fore feet upon lower log and reach into pen after bait, but at times they have been known to go inside. In this case the animal is not in danger as when the ""fall"" comes down the animal is not under it. If such is the case, that is, the animal entirely inside the pen, the trigger will be caught under the fall and the trapper knows that whatever is molesting his trap is doing so from the inside. All that the trapper has to do is lessen the size of the pen. This can be done by placing small stones or chunks on the inside of the pen or by driving stakes on the inside. By doing this the outside appearance is not changed. If, on the other hand, the trigger, that is the long one or spindle, not the short prop, is pulled out each time and often carried several feet, the trap is set too hard to ""fall"" and should be set easier. If the prop, or upright piece, is cut square across the top, take your knife and round off the edges so that the trigger will slip off easier. Again the pen may be torn down and the animal takes bait from the rear. Here is where it pays to build traps substantial. In such cases rebuild the pen, making it stronger. Should it be torn down on subsequent visits, the game is perhaps a fox. Of course if the pen has been torn down by some trapper or passing hunter, you can readily detect same by the manner in which it has been done. If the trapper is satisfied that it is an animal that is doing the mischief, he wants to plan carefully, and if he is an expert trapper, a steel trap or two will come into good play and the animal will be caught in the steel trap. The pen will not be torn down again. When traps are down note carefully the condition that they are in; see that the ""fall"" fits on the lower pole closely, and by the way, when building this is an important thing to notice--that the fall fits snugly on the lower or under pole. If a snare or spring pole is up but nothing caught, simply reset. Should many snares be up ""thrown"" and no catches, the trouble should be located at once. The noose is probably too large or small or made of limber or too stiff string or wire, or maybe it is too securely fastened. When resetting, note all these carefully and experience will sooner or later enable you to set just right to make a catch. If a certain snare is bothered continually, it will do no harm to set a steel trap where you think chances best of taking the animal. It matters but little to the trapper how the animal is caught, as it is his pelt that is wanted. In using the trip triggers with or without bait, the trapper should fasten the bait by either driving a peg through it and into the ground or tieing. In most instances the animal will throw the trap before getting to the bait, but it is well to take this precaution in case, for any reason, the animal should not step on the trip trigger at first. Sometimes a small animal may jump over the trip trigger in order to get the bait and in its endeavor to get bait will strike the trigger. The animal does not know that the trigger is dangerous, but now and then either steps or jumps over. Generally they step on the trigger, for if the trapper is ""onto his job"" the bait and trigger are so placed that the animal thinks the trip trigger is the place to put his foot. In using without bait the trigger is so arranged that the animal rubs or steps on the trigger when entering or leaving the pen or if at a trail or runway when passing along. CHAPTER XV. SPRING POLE SNARE. While the deadfall is good for most animals, there is no one trap that fills all requirements and in all places. Some animals may be shy of deadfalls that can be taken in spring poles, snares and steel traps. This trap is easily and cheaply constructed. It should be made near dens or where animals travel frequently. If a small bush is not growing handy, cut one. Drive a stake deeply in the ground, pull it out, stick the larger end of the bush cut into it. The explanation of this trap is as follows: 1, bait stick; 2, trigger; 3, noose made of wire or stout cord; 4, stay wire made of wire or cord; 5, bait; 6, spring pole. By noting carefully the illustration this trap can be built easily. The size of the bush or spring pole, of course, depends upon what sized animals you are trapping. This trap will take small game such as mink, opossum, skunk, etc., or can be made large and strong enough to catch mountain lion or black bear. * * * [Illustration: SPRING POLE AND SNARE.] The snare is made by building a round fence in a place where there is plenty of small trees. Select two about four inches apart for noose and snare entrance, and another long springy one for spring pole 6 or 7 feet long, bend this down and trim it. Have a noose made of limber wire or strong string and a cross piece. Having cut notches in the sides of the trees for the same to fit, have it to spring easy. For snaring rabbits have the fence quite high. [Illustration: SMALL GAME SNARE.] Observe the above description and you can readily make. No. 1 is the noose, No. 2 is spring pole, No. 3 fence, No. 4 bait. This snare already explained can be made any time in the year while the dead fall can only be constructed when the ground isn't frozen. * * * The snares can be either made of twine or wire. Many fox and lynx snare trappers in the North use small brass wire. [Illustration: WIRE AND TWINE SNARE.] Snares work well in cold weather and if properly constructed are pretty sure catchers. A--Spring pole. B--Staple. C--Two small nails driven in tree. (Three inch nail head, end down, with snare looped at each end with a foot of slack between. As soon as the D--three inch nail is pulled down, it will slip past the nail at top end, when spring pole will instantly take up the slack, also the fox, to staple and does its work.) E--Slack line or wire. F--Loop should be 7 inches in diameter and bottom of loop ten inches from the ground. Remarks--The nails should be driven above staple so it will pull straight down to release the snare fastening. [Illustration: SNARE LOOP.] A great many foxes have been caught in this country by the plan of the drawing outlined, writes J. C. Hunter, of Canada. A--the snare, should be made of rabbit wire, four or five strand twisted together. Should be long enough to make a loop about seven inches in diameter when set. Bottom side of snare should be about six inches from the ground. E--is a little stick, sharp at one end and split at the other, to stick in the ground and slip bottom of snare in split end, to hold snare steady. B--is catch to hold down spring pole. C--is stake. D--is spring pole. Some bend down a sapling for a spring pole, but we think the best way is to cut and trim up a small pole about ten feet long; fasten the big end under a root and bend it down over a crotch, stake or small tree. Snare should be set on a summer sheep path, where it goes through the bushes. [Illustration: PATH SET SNARE.] Stake might be driven down a foot or more back from the path, where a branch of an evergreen bush would hang over it so as to hide it and a string long enough from stake or trigger to snare to rest over path. * * * The setting of a snare is done thus: A good sound tamarac or other pole fifteen or twenty feet long is used for the tossing. The butt end of this must be five or six inches in diameter and the small end about three inches. A tree with a crotch in it is then selected to balance the pole upon. Failing to find such a tree in the proper place, an artificial fork is made by crossing two stout young birch or tamarac, firmly planted in the ground, and the two upper points tied together six or ten inches from the top. The balancing or tossing pole is lodged in this fork so that the part towards the butt would out-weigh a bear of two or three hundred pounds suspended from the small end. Next a stout little birch or spruce is selected and a section of three or four cut off. From this all the branches are removed, except one, the small end is pointed and driven deep into the ground a few inches at one side of the bear road. The snare is made of three twisted strands of eighteen thread cod line and is firmly tied to the tossing pole. A few dried branches are stuck in the ground each side of the path, the pole is depressed so the very end is caught under the twig on the stick driven in the ground for that purpose and the noose is stiffened by rubbing balsam branches which leave enough gum to make it hold its shape. The noose is kept in the proper position (the bottom being about sixteen inches above the road and the diameter being about eleven inches) by blades of dry grass looped to it and the ends let into a gash on sticks at each side, put there for that purpose. No green branches are used in the hedge about the road because this would make the bear suspicious. The snare is now complete and the hunter stands back and examines it critically. His last act is to rub some beaver castor on the trunk of some tree standing near the road, ten or twelve feet from the snare. This is done on another tree at the same distance on the opposite side of the snare. Bears are attracted by the smell of the castor and rub themselves against the tree in the same way as a dog rubs on carrion. When finished rubbing on one tree he scents the other and in going to get at the fresh one tries to pass thru the snare. He feels the noose tighten about his neck and struggles; this pulls the end of the tossing pole from under the branch trigger, up goes the pole and old Bruin with it. * * * My way, according to a Massachusetts trapper, to trap skunk without scenting, and it is successful, is to snare them. Use a spring pole and if one does not grow handy, cut one and set it up as firmly as possible about four or five feet from the burrow and to one side. Probably the ground is frozen and you will have to brace it up with logs or stones or perhaps lash it to a stump or root. When the top of the pole is bent down it should be caught under the end of a log or rock on the opposite side of the hole so that it can easily be dislodged by an animal, either going in or out of the burrow. The snare or noose is attached to the spring pole directly over the center of the burrows and the bottom of the noose should be an inch and a half or two inches from the ground to allow the animal's feet to pass under it and his little pointed nose to go thru the center. Set the noose as closely over the entrance of the hole as possible and one or two carefully arranged twigs will keep it in place. Strong twine is better for the noose than large cord as the skunk is less liable to notice it. When a skunk passes in or out of the hole the noose becomes tightened about his neck and a slight pull releases the spring pole which soon strangles him. While this may seem an elaborate description of so simple a trap, still, like any other trap, if set in a careless, half-hearted manner, it will meet with indifferent success and, tho simple the snare, with a little thought and ingenuity can be applied in almost any situation for the capture of small game. CHAPTER XVI. TRAIL SET SNARE. Many of the boys, writes an Indiana trapper, have come forth with their particular snares and methods of making same, all of which I believe are good, but most of them require to be baited, which is one bad feature as applied to certain districts, for such has been my experience that in many localities it is utterly impossible to get animals to take bait. This snare may be used as a blind or set with bait as your trapping grounds, or rather the animals, may require. It is very inexpensive and so simple any boy can make it. First get a strip of iron one-eighth inch thick, three-eighths or one-half wide. Cut it in nine inch lengths and bend in the shape of Fig. 2, having drilled a one-fourth inch hole in either end. Next secure some light sheet iron, or heavy tin, cut in pieces 2 3/4 inches by 5 3/4 inches for the pan, and drill a one-fourth inch hole in center of same as shown in Fig. 3. It is now a very easy matter to rivet the pan or Fig. 3 to Fig. 2. This done, take some 20 penny spikes and cut off the heads as per Fig. 1. [Illustration: TRIP PAN OR PLATE.] Now brass, or preferably copper wire, can be had on spools at most any hardware store, which is used for the loops, as it is so pliable yet sufficiently strong to hold any of the small fur bearers, as it is made in many sizes. Use the brass or copper wire only for the loops, as ordinary stove pipe wire is just the article for the finishing of the snare. For a blind set to be placed in the run of the animals, make a double loop, that is, two loops for each snare. Now, take a bunch of these with you and find the runs or follow the ravines and creeks where they feed. If you can find a tree in a favorable spot on their runs, take one of your headless spikes and drive in the base of the tree a few inches from the ground. Now take No. 2 with the pan riveted thereon and hook bent and over spike, driving spike into tree until pan is level and until there is just room enough to hook loop of wire over head of spike. (See illustration.) Dig out under pan so same can fall when stepped upon. Then secure a rock or chunk of sufficient weight and fasten to other end of wire. Throw this over limb of tree and hook loop over head of a spike, having first put No. 2 in place. Put one loop on one side of the pan and the other loop on the other side, so that an animal coming either way will step upon the pan to his sorrow. This done, drive a staple in tree over wire running from spike to limb, which will prevent the animal being pulled over the limb and escaping. [Illustration: DOUBLE TRAIL SET.] Having covered everything up with the natural surroundings and left no signs, you may claim the first furrier that happens that way and he will be waiting for you. This snare may also be used with the ordinary spring pole by driving spike in a stake, then the stake in the ground, in which case it is best to make the usual V-shaped pen with stakes or stones, covering same over at top and setting so the pan will be right in the mouth of the pen and the single loop just between pan and bait. In this way they tread upon the pan just before they reach the bait. You find this snare easily thrown. They will not cost you over three cents a piece, and any man can easily carry one hundred of them and not be half loaded. * * * In many ways the snare is splendid for lynx. Here in Western Ontario, says a well known trapper, where the lynx seldom take bait, they may be taken quite easily in snares set on snowshoe trails. Fig. 1 shows a wire snare set on such a trail. I go about it in the following manner: Having found a suitable place along the edge of some swamp or alder thicket, I cut a spruce or balsam tree, about ten or twelve feet long, and throw it across the trail. I press the tree down until the stem of the tree is about twenty inches above the trail, and make an opening in the trail by cutting a few of the limbs away on the under side of the trail. Then I set a couple of dead stakes on each side so as to leave the opening about ten inches wide and hang my snare between these stakes and directly under the stem of the tree. [Illustration: TRAIL SET SNARES.] The snare should be about nine inches in diameter and should be fastened securely to the tree. It should also be fastened lightly to the stakes on either side, so it will not spring out of shape. The best way is to make a little split in the side of each stake, and fasten the snare with a very small twig stuck in the split stake. I make the snares of rabbit wire, about four or five plies thick, twisted. Some trappers prefer to use a cord. The dark colored codfish line is best, and it is best to use a spring pole snare, and Fig. 3 shows the method of tieing and fastening to the stakes. It will be seen that when the lynx passes his head through the snare he only needs to give a slight pull to open the slip knot and release the spring pole. To prevent the rabbits from biting a cord snare, rub it well with the dropping of the lynx or fox and also, never use any green wood other than spruce or balsam, as any fresh green wood is sure to attract the rabbits. You may also put a small piece of beaver castor along the trail on each side of the snare, and you will be more sure of the lynx, as beaver castor is very attractive to these big cats. * * * We will now proceed to make another spring pole snare, altho the one described before is more practical, says a Colorado trapper. It is made like the preceding one except the trigger, etc. This one is to be used on a runway without any bait whatever. The illustration shows the trigger as it appears in the runway. No. 1 is the trip stick; No. 2, the stay crotch; No. 3, the trigger; No. 4, the loop; No. 5, the pathway, and No. G, the stay wire. [Illustration: PATH SNARE.] The animal in coming on down the path (5) passes its body or neck thru the loop made of stout soft insulated wire (4); in passing it steps on the trip stick (1) which settles with the animal's weight, releasing the trigger (3) which in turn releases the stay wire (6) and jerks the loop (4) around the animal; the spring pole onto which the stay-wire it attached lifts your game up into the air, choking it to death and placing it out of reach of other animals that would otherwise destroy your fur. A small notch cut in the stay crotch where the end of the trip stick rests will insure the trigger to be released. This will hold the trip stick firm at the end, making it move only at the end where the animal steps. CHAPTER XVII. BAIT SET SNARE. This snare I consider good for such animals as will take bait. (See page 141.) No. 1 and 2, headless wire nails driven horizontally into tree about ten inches from ground. No. 3, a No. 10 or 12 wire nail with head used to catch under No. 1 and 2. No. 4, bait stick or trigger. No. 3 passes through No. 4. No. 5, bait, frog tied to bottom of No. 4. No. 6's snare, fastened to No. 3 by two half hitches, then fastened to No. 3 by two half hitches, then fastened to seven or spring pole. No. 7, spring pole. Nos. 8, 8, small stakes driven in ground to form a pen. Nos. 9, 9, two small twigs split at top to hold snare loop in place. Nos. 1 and 2 should be about 4 inches apart. No. 3 goes through a gimlet hole in No. 4. About three inches from the top use any small round stick from 1/2 to 1 inch in thickness, not necessary to flatten No. 4 as in illustration. Use it natural bark on. From hole in No. 4 to bottom end should be about 7 inches. [Illustration: RAT RUNWAY SNARE. UNDERGROUND RAT RUNWAY. RUNWAY AND CUBBY SET. LOG SET SNARE. COW PATH SNARE.] Snare loop about 6 inches in front of bait, held in place by 9, 9, slightly leaning against 8,8. It can be plainly seen that if an animal takes No. 5 in its jaws and tries to remove it, it moves out the bottom of No. 4, moving forward No. 3 until, flip! up she goes. The top of No. 4 must be tight against the tree when set. [Illustration: LIFTING POLE SNARE.] No. 3 should just catch under No. 1 and 2, then it takes but 1/2 inch to pull on bait to spring it. Bait with frogs, fish, tainted meat for skunk, and pieces of rabbit, muskrat or bird, for mink. The lynx, like the wolverine, is not afraid of a snowshoe track, and will follow a line of rabbit snare for long distances, and when he sees a bunny hanging up, he, without the least compunction, appropriates it to himself, by right of discovery. When he does this once he will come again and the Indian hunter, knowing this, at once sets a snare for ""Mister Cat."" Sometimes when the thief has left a portion of the rabbit, a branch house is built up against the trunk of some tree, the remains of the rabbit placed at the back and the snare set at the doorway. [Illustration: BAIT SET SNARE.] A stout birch stick is cut about three or four feet long and lodged on a forked stick at each side of the door and about two and a half feet high. To the middle of this crossbar the end of the twine is tied; No. 9 Holland is generally used, or No. 6 thread cod line. This is gummed by rubbing balsam branches up and down the twine in the same way as the bear snare. The noose is held in shape in one or two places at each side by a light strand of wood or blade of grass and a couple of small dry sticks are placed upright under the snare to prevent the cat from passing beneath. The loop is almost as large as for a bear and as high from the ground, if not higher. The lynx has long legs and carries his head straight in front of him and takes a snare by pushing thru it, or by a rush, never crouching and then springing. As the resort of rabbits is a young growth of country, there are also lynx in the greatest numbers. Rabbits and partridges are their principal food. When the Indian enters a new piece of country to set rabbit snares to support his wife and family and sees signs of lynx, he combines the two kinds of hunting and as he goes along, once in a while, he bars his snowshoe track by placing a lynx snare in the way. The lynx are fond of the smell of castor, as indeed are most animals, so the hunter rubs a little on a tree at each side of his snare for the cat to rub against when he comes that way. The snare is never tied to anything immovable, as they are very powerful and would break the twine. As soon as the noose tightens the cross piece comes readily away from the supports and the cat springs to one side. The stick, however, either knocks him a blow or gets tangled in his legs. This he tries several times, but with the same result, that bothersome stick is always hanging to his neck. About the last effort he makes to free himself is to ascend a tree. This, however, is nearly always fatal, for after he gets up a certain distance this trouble some stick is sure to get fast back of some limb. The lynx by this time, having become a pretty cross cat, makes matters worse and the hunter finds him hanging dead, at times twenty or thirty feet from the earth. CHAPTER XVIII THE BOX TRAP. This trap is put to various uses. The beginner usually has one or two with which he traps for rabbits. In fact they are great for that for the animal is not injured, which is often the case when shot or caught by dogs. Rabbits caught in box traps are therefore the best for eating. The trapper who wants to secure fur-bearers alive to sell to parks, menageries or to start a ""fur ranch"" usually uses the box trap. The size for rabbits is about 30 inches long by 5 wide and 6 high. The boards can be of any kind but pine, poplar, etc., being light is much used. The boards need only be a half inch thick. To make a trap you will need four pieces 30 inches long; two of these for the sides should be six inches wide; the other two for top and bottom should be 5 inches. These pieces should be nailed on the top and bottom of the sides. This will make the inside of the trap six inches high by four wide. It is best to have your trap narrow so that the animal you are trapping cannot turn in the trap. In one end of the trap wires or small iron rods should be placed (see illustration). These should be about an inch apart. In the other end the door is constructed. This can be made out of wire also. The bottom of door should strike about eight inches inside. It will be seen that an animal pushing against the door, from the outside, raises it, but once on the inside the more they push against it the tighter it becomes. [Illustration: THE BOX TRAP.] The trap can be set at holes where game is known to be, or can be placed where game frequents and baited. If bait is used place a little prop under the door and place bait back in trap a foot or more. Bait to use of course depending upon what you are trapping. The trap described is about right size for the common rabbit and mink. For skunk and opossum a trap a little larger will be required. For mink and other animals that are gnawers the traps should be visited daily for they may gnaw and escape. If impossible to visit traps daily they should be lined with tin. In many places these traps, with a door at each end, are used for catching muskrat. They are set in their dens under water and either tied or weighted down. The rats are caught either going in or leaving. In making these traps the beginner is apt to make them too wide--so the animal can turn within. This is a mistake for it gives the game more freedom and room to gnaw to liberty. The animal simply goes in and is there until the trapper comes along and removes the game. Skunk can be drowned when caught in this trap without scenting if the trapper knows how to go about it. The trap should be handled carefully. Take to water sufficiently deep to cover the trap and slowly sink and then either weight the trap or hold down until the animal is drowned. The box trap is a humane trap if visited daily. They are rather unhandy to carry about and few trappers want many, yet under certain conditions they are very useful. They can be made during idle time. For mink and other shy animals they should be handled as little as possible. They should be made of old boards or at least avoid all appearances of newness. * * * Some sections saplings to make deadfalls cannot be had and for the benefit of such, a wooden trap, three feet long and six inches wide and deep, is a good manner to take muskrat, writes a Western trapper. The boards can be cut out of any old lumber. In each end is a wire door, hung on hinges at the top. These doors rise at the slightest push on the outside, but will not open from the inside. The trap is sunk in the water at the entrance to the den and is fastened there. A muskrat in entering or leaving the den is sure to enter the trap. The animal, of course, could gnaw out, but will drown before it has time to accomplish this. Several rats are often taken, where they are numerous, in a night. Traps of this kind can be used to best advantage in lakes and ponds or where the height of the stream does not vary much. If they are set along creeks and rivers you want to fasten them securely or take them up before heavy rains, as they are almost sure to be washed away. * * * I see in a recent number where George Walker wanted some one to tell through H-T-T how to make box trap to catch muskrat. Here is a good way: First take four boards 36 inches long, nail together leaving both ends open. Next a small gate, consisting of a square piece of wood supplied with a few stiff wires is then pivoted inside of each opening so as to work freely and fall easily when raised. The bait is fastened inside the center of the box. The animal in quest of the bait finds an easy entrance, as the wires lift at slight pressure, but the exit after the gate has closed is so difficult that escape is almost beyond question. To insure further strength it is advisable to connect the lower ends of the wires by a cross piece of fine wire twisted about each. If you have good luck you can catch two and three in this trap each night. Set in two or three inches of water where muskrat frequents, or set in skunk dens. CHAPTER XIX. THE COOP TRAP. This trap is used with great success for catching wild turkey, pheasants, quail and other feathered game. In some states the law forbids the use of this and similar traps. The trap is built like an ordinary rail pen. In fact, some use small rails when constructing this trap for wild turkey, while others build of small straight poles. The pen is usually six feet or more square and about three high. The ""coop"" is stronger if drawn in from bottom to top (see illustration). The top must be covered and weighted. A ditch is now dug about a foot wide. This ditch should begin about three feet from coop and lead within. Corn or other grain is scattered on the outside and in the trench leading into the coop. On the inside considerable should be scattered in the leaves and small but short twigs. The turkeys once on the inside will eat the grain and scratch among the leaves which generally partly fill the trench and as the birds are usually looking up, when not eating, they do not think of the trench thru which they entered. The same trap will catch quail, but of course is built much smaller. About three feet square being large enough and a foot high is sufficient. Some have built quail coops out of cornstalks and report catches. [Illustration: THE COOP TRAP.] The quail coop should have the ditch leading to the inside the same as described for turkey. Of course the ditch should be much smaller--only large enough for one bird to enter at a time. On the inside of coop it is a good idea to lay a board six inches or wider over the ditch. The bait should be wheat or other small grain or seeds that the birds like. Scatter thinly on the outside and in the trench, but on the inside place more liberally. Chaff or leaves should be placed on the inside so that the birds in scratching for the grain will partly fill up the hole thru which they came. Quail, turkey and other feathered game once on the inside and after eating the bait never think of going down into the ditch and out, but walk round and round the coop looking thru the chinks and trying to escape. The largest catches are made by baiting where the birds frequent for some days or even weeks before trying to make a catch. It is well to make the coops long in advance so that the birds will be accustomed to them, especially wild turkey. These traps are some times used with the figure 4 trigger, but when thus set seldom more than one or two birds are caught at a time. CHAPTER XX. THE PIT TRAP. This method of catching game and fur bearing animals is not much used, as the labor in connection with making a pit trap is considerable. The method, however, is an excellent one for taking some of the larger animals, especially when they are wanted for parks, menageries, etc., uninjured. The pit should be several feet deep and bait placed as shown. Another way is to cover the top with rotten limbs, leaves, etc., and place the bait on this. The animal in trying to secure the bait breaks thru. The dirt from the pit should be removed in baskets. Catches are made by digging a pit across animal runways or trails. When the ground is not frozen or during rainy weather it is well to place a board several inches wide at top. The animal in going over its usual trail steps upon the frail covering and falls thru. While the pit trap is mostly used for capturing large game, it can be used to advantage for taking many of the smaller fur bearers. Where muskrat are numerous, instead of digging a pit, secure a box about three feet deep. The width and length make no difference. Place a few flat rocks in the bottom and place in the water where rats frequent. Make the box solid. The box must be water tight. The weight should bring the top of box to within a few inches of water. A couple of boards or chunks should be so placed that the rats will climb up them and to the box along the edge of which the bait is placed. [Illustration: THE PIT TRAP.] The pit trap can be used where skunk and other animals frequent. Bait the place for some days before the pit is dug. If the pit is to be used without bait, then find the runways of the animal and dig the pit. While some animals may not be shy, if a little fresh dirt is lying around, yet it is best to be very careful and carry all earth taken out of pit a few rods to one side. Pits of this kind should be several feet deep. The success the hunter or trapper has in using this method will depend largely upon his knowledge of the game he is after. Unless the animal or animals are wanted alive, the work to make a pit is too great and the chances of a catch never certain. This way is not practicable under ordinary circumstances, yet where the game is wanted alive and sound, is worth trying. CHAPTER XXI. NUMBER OF TRAPS. In some localities there are not many dens and trappers make use of about all when trapping that section, but in other parts of the country dens are so numerous that to place a trap at each is impossible. In states where groundhogs (woodchucks), are numerous there are often a hundred or more dens along a single bluff or rocky bank. To have enough steel traps to set one at each is something few trappers do, yet two or three deadfalls in connection with a line of steel traps is all that is necessary and the trapper can move on to the next bluff where dens are numerous and set another trap or two. As a rule it is where there are many dens, close together, that deadfalls make the best catches, yet when you find a good den anywhere, set or construct a deadfall. All trappers have noticed when tracking animals in the snow that they visit nearly every den along their route, not always going in but just sticking their head in. When thus investigating, the animal smells the bait and is hungry (as nine times out of ten the animal is hunting something to eat), and if your trap is set properly you are reasonably sure to make a catch. In the North, Canada, Alaska and some of the states on the Canadian border where trapping is made a business, it is no uncommon thing for one man to have as many as one hundred and fifty traps and some have out twice that many, or three hundred. Marten trappers in the trackless forests often blaze out a route fifty or more miles in length, building shelters along the line where nights are spent. The trapper who only spends a few hours each day at trapping and lives in thickly settled districts will find that it is hard for him to locate suitable places perhaps for more than thirty to fifty traps, yet if these will be looked at properly during the season the catch will justify the time and labor in building. The number of deadfalls and snares that each trapper should construct in his section must largely be determined by himself, depending upon how large a territory he has to trap over without running into other trappers' grounds. It will be little use to build traps where there are other trappers as trouble will occur, traps may be torn to pieces, etc. Yet there are many good places to build traps in your immediate locality no doubt. If there are any creeks near and woods along the banks you will find good places at both creek and in the woods. If in sections where there is no forest, like some western states, deadfalls trapping may be difficult from the fact that there is nothing to build them with. In such cases the portable traps, (described elsewhere) in this book, can probably be used to advantage, but best of all in such places is steel traps. The number of deadfalls and snares that a trapper can attend to is large, from the fact that the game is killed and as the weather is usually cold, the traps need not be looked at only about twice each week. In the North, many trappers have such long lines that they do not get over them only once a week. The trouble where deadfalls are only looked at once in seven days is that other animals are apt to find the game and may injure the fur, or even destroy the pelt. Where snares with spring pole attachment are used, and the weather is cold, the trapper need not make the rounds only once a week, as all animals will be suspended in the air and out of the reach of flesh eaters. South of 40 degrees where the weather is not severe, it is policy to look at traps at least twice a week, and in the extreme South the trapper should make his rounds every day. It will thus be seen that a trapper in the North can attend more deadfalls and snares than one in the South or even in the Central States. No trapper should have more traps or longer lines than he can properly attend to. The fur bearing animals are none too numerous without having them caught and their pelts and fur spoiled before the arrival of the trapper. CHAPTER XXII. WHEN TO TRAP. The proper season to begin trapping is when cold weather comes. The old saying that fur is good any month that has an ""r"" in does not hold good except in the North. Even there September is too early to begin, yet muskrat and skunk are worth something as well as other furs. In the spring April is the last month with an ""r."" In most sections muskrat, bear, beaver, badger and otter are good all thru April, but other animals began shedding weeks before. The rule for trappers to follow is to put off trapping in the fall until nights are frosty and the ground freezes. Generally speaking in Canada and the more Northern States trappers can begin about November 1 and should cease March 1, with the exception of water animals, bear and badger, which may be trapped a month later. In the Central and Southern States trappers should not begin so early and should leave off in the spring from one to four weeks sooner--depending upon how far South they are located. At the interior Hudson Bay posts, where their word is law, October 25 is appointed to begin and May 25th to quit hunting and trapping with the exception of bear, which are considered prime up to June 10. Remember that the above dates are for the interior or Northern H. B. Posts, which are located hundreds of miles north of the boundary between the United States and Canada. The skunk is the first animal to become prime, then the coon, marten, fisher, mink and fox, but the latter does not become strictly prime until after a few days of snow, says an old Maine trapper. Rats and beaver are late in priming up as well as otter and mink, and tho the mink is not strictly a land animal, it becomes prime about with the later land animals. The bear, which is strictly a land animal, is not in good fur until snow comes and not strictly prime until February or March. * * * With the first frosts and cool days many trappers begin setting and baiting their traps. That it is easier to catch certain kinds of fur-bearing animals early in the season is known to most trappers and for this reason trapping in most localities is done too early in the season. Some years ago when trapping was done even earlier than now, we examined mink skins that were classed as No. 4 and worth 10 or 15 cents, that, had they been allowed to live a few weeks longer, their hides would have been No. 1 and worth, according to locality, from $1.50 to $3.50 each. This early trapping is a loss to the trapper if they will only pause and think. There are only so many animals in a locality to be caught each winter and why catch them before their fur is prime? In the latitude of Southern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, etc., skunk caught in the month of October are graded back from one to three grades (and even sometimes into trash), where if they were not caught until November 15th how different would be the classification. The same is true of opossum, mink, muskrat, coon, fox, etc. * * * Skunk are one of the animals that become prime first each fall. The date that they become prime depends much on the weather. Fifteen years ago, when trapping in Southern Ohio, the writer has sold skunk at winter prices caught as early as October 16, while other seasons those caught the 7th of November, or three weeks later, blued and were graded back. Am glad to say that years ago I learned not to put out traps until November. That the weather has much to do with the priming of furs and pelts there is no question. If the fall is colder than usual the furs will become prime sooner, while if the freezing weather is later the pelts will be later in ""priming up."" In the sections where weasel turn white (then called ermine by many), trappers have a good guide. When they become white they are prime and so are most other land animals. In fact, some are fairly good a week or two before. When a pelt is put on the stretcher and becomes blue in a few days it is far from prime and will grade no better than No. 2. If the pelt turns black the chances are that the pelt will grade No. 3 or 4, In the case of mink, when dark spots only appear on the pelt, it is not quite prime. Trappers and hunters should remember that no pelt is prime or No. 1 when it turns the least blue. Opossum skins seldom turn blue even if caught early--most other skins do. CHAPTER XXIII. SEASON'S CATCH. The reason that many trappers make small catches, each season, is from the fact that they spend only an hour or so each day at trapping, while at most other business the party devotes the entire day. The trapper who looks out his grounds some weeks in advance of the trapping season is not idling his time away. He should also have a line of traps constructed in advance of the trapping season. There is a fascination connected with trapping that fills one with a strange feeling when all alone constructing deadfalls and snares or on the rounds to see what success has been yours. I have often visited traps of old trappers, where from two to five carcasses were hanging from a nearby sapling. There are several instances on record where two animals have been caught in one deadfall at the same time. A well-known trapper of Ohio claims to have caught three skunk in one deadfall at one time a few years since. Whether such is an actual fact or not we are unable to say. The cases on record where two animals have been caught are so well substantiated that there is little room left to doubt the truth of same. The catching of two animals at the same time is not such an extraordinary occurrence as many, at first, think. If two animals should come along at the same time and, smelling the bait, begin a meal, the result is easily seen. While trapping with deadfalls is a humane way of catching fur-bearing animals, another thing in their favor is that skunk are usually killed without ""perfuming"" themselves, trap and trapper as well. Then, again, if once caught, there is no getting away. Trappers in the forest always have the necessary tools, axe or heavy hatchet and knife, with which to build a deadfall, while their steel traps may all be exhausted and none set within miles. A deadfall is built and perhaps on the trapper's return an animal is lying dead between the poles. * * * During extreme cold weather there is but little use to look at traps set for skunk, raccoon, etc., as they do not travel. Before a thaw or warm spell the entire line should be gone over and all old bait removed and replaced with fresh bait. Like many another trapper you will visit your traps time after time without catching much if any fur, yet if your traps are properly constructed and are spread over a large area, you will catch considerable fur during the season. Deadfalls and snares can be strung out for miles and while they should be looked at every other day, in good trapping weather, they can be neglected, if the trapper cannot get around more than twice a week, without game escaping. If you visit your traps frequently there will be no loss from injury to fur. While it is true, should a small animal be caught in a heavy trap, one built for much larger game, it will be considerably flattened out, yet the skin or fur is not damaged. There is nothing to damage your catch, in most sections, unless you do not visit your traps often enough in warm weather, when they may be faintly tainted. Most trapping is done, however, in cool weather, but occasionally there may come a warm spell when skins become tainted. If found in such condition skin as soon as possible and place upon boards or stretchers. Another thing greatly to the advantage of the deadfall and snare trapper is the fact that a trapper never knows just when he will be able to visit his traps again; the unexpected often happens, and should it be a day or so longer than expected the deadfall or snare still securely holds the game. As all experienced trappers know, the first night of a cold spell is a splendid one for animals to travel (they seem forewarned about the weather) and a good catch is the result. If the trapper is a ""weather prophet"" his traps are all freshly baited and in order, for this is the time that game is on the move--often looking up new and warm dens and generally hungry. Should the next days be cold and stormy the trapper should get over the line as promptly as possible. After once getting over the line after the ""cold spell,"" it is not so important that traps be looked at for some days again. The successful trapper will always be on the watch of the weather. Some animals, it is true, travel during the coldest weather, but there are many that do not, so that the trapper who sees that his deadfalls are freshly baited when the signs point to warmer weather. After days and nights of severe weather most animals are hungry and when the weather moderates they are on the move. * * * ""I have more than one hundred deadfalls and catch large numbers of skunk,"" writes a Connecticut trapper. ""A few years ago a trapper within two miles of here caught more than 60 coon in deadfalls. Since then coon have been rather scarce, but I am going to try them this coming fall. I prefer red squirrel for skunk bait to anything else, and extract of valerian for scent. Try it, trapper--it can't be beat. I have used it for twenty years and can catch my share every time."" * * * The trapper that makes the largest catches usually is the one that has deadfalls and snares in addition to steel traps. Recently two trappers wrote of their season's catch and added that a good proportion was caught in deadfalls and snares. These trappers were located in Western Canada; marten 54, lynx 12, mink 19, ermine 71, wild cat 11, foxes 18. While these trappers did not say, it is presumed that the foxes were caught in snares or steel traps, for it is seldom that one is caught in a deadfall. In Canada and the New England States, where foxes are plentiful, the snare is used to a considerable extent. Skunk, mink, ermine, weasel and opossum are easily caught in deadfalls. One trapper in a southern state is said to have caught 94 mink, besides 38 coon and 57 opossum, in 28 deadfalls, from November 25th to February 25th, or three months. CHAPTER XXIV. GENERAL INFORMATION. Early in September, 1906, the editor spent a couple of days at his home in Southern Ohio, where in the '80's along and near a small stream known as Kyger Creek, considerable trapping was done. If readers are curious and have a good, large map of Ohio, and look at the southern border, some fifty miles above the mouth of the Scioto river, on a direct line or about double that by following the winding of the river, they will find Kyger Creek. The stream is about ten miles long and empties into the Ohio river below the village of Cheshire. The country is rather rough and rocky, but the timber has mainly disappeared. A quarter of a century ago, opossum, muskrat, skunk, and fox were more numerous than now. Mink at that time were few, but in the early '80's they seemed to become fairly plentiful all at once. The high price has caused considerable trapping, and their number has decreased of recent years. In trapping we found deadfalls, properly made, set and baited to be an excellent trap for mink, skunk and opossum. As there were few coon where we were trapping, but few were caught, yet an old trapper nearby caught several in both deadfalls and steel traps each season. There is no doubt but that a trapper who expects to remain months at the same place should have a few deadfalls. These traps, like steel traps, to make catches, do not depend upon numbers so much as correct and careful construction and setting. A half dozen deadfalls located at the right places, carefully built and properly set, are worth probably as much as fifty carelessly constructed and located at haphazard. Some object to deadfalls because fox are seldom caught in them. It is true that few fox are taken in deadfalls, although in the far North some are, and especially Arctic and White fox. The deadfall trapper, however, who gives care and attention to his traps finds them fur takers. They can be built small for weasel or a little larger for mink, marten and civet cat; or larger for opossum and skunk; still heavier for coon and wild cat and even to a size that kills bear. Some trappers find the mink hard to catch. At some seasons they are easy to take in deadfalls. Long in the '80's in five winters eight mink were caught in one deadfall. The first winter one was caught; second, two; third, three; fourth and fifth, each one. If our memory serves us right, the trap was first built in the fall of 1887, and was located on the bank about ten feet to the left of a sycamore, which at that time was standing. There was a den under the tree entering near the water, with an outlet on the bank only a few feet from the trap, and near where the pen and bait were located. This deadfall was built much like the illustration shown here. While the fall was of hickory, not a vestige remained when looking at the place in September, 1906. The pen should be built strong and tight so that the animal will not tear it to pieces and get at the bait from the rear. The ""fall"" or top pole can be of any kind of wood, but hickory, oak, beech, maple, and other heavy wood are all good. The pole should be heavy enough to kill the animal without placing any weights on it. When building it is a good idea to let the top pole extend about a couple of feet beyond the pen. This will give more weight on the animal when the trap falls. [Illustration: A GOOD CATCHER.] The two piece triggers may work hard, especially if the log used for the fall has rough bark on. In this case it might be well to smooth with your axe or hatchet. In setting with the two piece trigger make them out of as hard wood as can be found. The long piece can be slightly flattened on the under side, or the side on which the upper end of the upright or prop sets. The prop should be cut square on the lower end while the upper end might be a little rounding, as this will tend to make the top or bait trigger slip off easier. In setting raise up the top pole and hold in position with the knee. This gives both hands free to adjust the triggers. When you think you have them right, gradually let the weight off your knee and then try the trigger. You will soon learn about how they are to be set. The bait should be tied on or the bait trigger may have a prong on to hold the bait. If you find the bait gone and the trap still up the chances are that it was set too hard and the animal stole the bait. Of late years in some sections, mice have been very troublesome, eating the bait. In other places birds are bait stealers, and for this reason it is best to set traps rather hard to throw. The location of a deadfall has much to do with the catch. Old trappers know if they were to set a steel trap in a place not frequented by fur bearers that their catch would be next to nothing. The same applies to all sets, whether steel traps, snares or deadfalls. In the illustration it will be noticed that the opening or the side which the animal enters for bait is facing the creek. When building these traps it will be found best to leave the open side toward the water if trapping for mink or coon, as they generally leave the edge of the water going directly to dens along and near the bank. The under log in the deadfall shown does not extend but a few inches beyond the two end stakes. It should extend eight or ten inches beyond. The four stakes at pen must be of sufficient length that when the trap is set they extend above the top or fall pole. If they did not, the trap in falling, might catch on the end of one of the stakes and not go down. Along streams these traps need not be close. A couple to the mile is plenty. Of course, if there are places where dens are numerous more can be built to advantage, while along other stretches of water it may be useless to build them at all. It all depends upon whether animals travel there. You cannot catch them in any kind of trap if they are not there. For opossum, skunk, mink, civet cat, coon, ermine, etc., find where the animals live or where they go frequently searching for food. If building where there are dens, either locate within a few feet of the one that appears best or just off the path that the animal takes in going from one to the other. Have the open part next to path and say only three feet off. Marten trappers, while placing traps on high ground, do not pay so much attention to dens and paths, for these animals spend much time in trees looking for squirrels, birds, etc., but go through the forest ""spotting a line"" and locate a deadfall in likely ground about every 200 yards, or about 8 to the mile. CHAPTER XXV. SKINNING AND STRETCHING. Much importance should be attached to the skinning and stretching of all kinds of skins so as to command the highest commercial value. The fisher, otter, foxes, lynx, marten, mink, ermine, civet, cats and skunk should be cased, that is, taken off whole. Commence with the knife in the center of one hind foot and slit up the inside of the leg, up to and around the vent and down the other leg in a like manner. Cut around the vent, taking care not to cut the lumps or glands in which the musk of certain animals is secreted, then strip the skin from the bone of the tail with the aid of a split stick gripped firmly in the hand while the thumb of the other hand presses against the animals back just above. Make no other slits in the skin except in the case of the skunk and otter, whose tails require to be split, spread, and tacked on a board. Turn the skin back over the body, leaving the pelt side out and the fur side inward, and by cutting a few ligaments, it will peel off very readily. Care should be taken to cut closely around the nose, ears and lips, so as not to tear the skin. Have a board made about the size and shape of the three-board stretcher, only not split in halves. This board is to put the skin over in order to hold it better while removing particles of fat and flesh which adheres to it while skinning, which can be done with a blunt-edged knife, by scraping the skin from the tail down toward the nose--the direction in which the hair roots grow--never scrape up the other way or you will injure the fiber of the skin, and care should be taken not to scrape too hard, for if the skin fiber is injured its value is decreased. [Illustration: SINGLE AND THREE BOARD STRETCHER.] Now, having been thoroughly ""fleshed,"" as the above process is called, the skin is ready for stretching, which is done by inserting the two halves of the three-board stretcher and drawing the skin over the boards to its fullest extent, with the back on one side and the belly on the other, and tacking it fast by driving in a small nail an inch or so from each side of the tail near the edges of the skin; also, in like manner the other side. Now insert the wedge and drive it between the halves almost its entire length. Care should be taken, however, to not stretch the skin so much as to make the fur appear thin and thus injure its value. Now put a nail in the root of the tail and fasten it to the wedge; also, draw up all slack parts and fasten. Care should be taken to have both sides of the skin of equal length, which can be done by lapping the leg flippers over each other. Now draw up the under lip and fasten, and pull the nose down until it meets the lip and tack it fast, and then the skin is ready to hang away to cure. Do not dry skins at a fire or in the sun, or in smoke. It often burns them when they will not dress and are of no value. Dry in a well-covered shed or tent where there is a free circulation of air, and never use any preparation, such as alum and salt, as it only injures them for market. Never stretch the noses out long, as some trappers are inclined to do, but treat them as above described, and they will command better values. Fur buyers are inclined to class long-nosed skins as ""southern"" and pay a small price for them, as Southern skins are much lighter in fur than those of the North. The badger, beaver, bear, raccoon and wolf must always be skinned ""open;"" that is, ripped up the belly from vent to chin after the following manner: Cut across the hind legs as if to be ""cased"" and then rip up the belly. The skin can then be removed by flaying as in skinning a beef. * * * Another experienced trapper says: The animals which should be skinned open are bear, beaver, raccoon, badger, timber wolf and wolverines. The way to do this is to rip the skin open from the point of the lower jaw, in a straight line, to the vent. Then rip it open on the back of the hind legs, and the inside of the front legs, and peel the skin carefully off the body. Beaver, however, should not have the front legs split open and the tail, having no fur, is of course cut off. If the skin is a fine one, and especially in the case of bear, the feet should not be cut off, but should be skinned, leaving the claws on. I would also advise saving the skull, and the proper way to clean it is to scrape the flesh off with a knife. When the animal is skinned, roll the skin up with the fur side out and put it in your pack. See that there are no burrs or lumps of mud in the fur, before you do any fleshing. My way of fleshing furs--there may be better ways--is to draw the skin over a smooth board, made for the purpose and scraping, or peeling, with a blunt edged knife. Commence at the tail, and scrape towards the head, otherwise you may injure the fibre of the hide. Over the back and shoulders of most animals is a thin layer of flesh. This should be removed, and when done, there should be nothing remaining but the skin and fur. Raccoon and muskrat are easily fleshed by pinching the flesh between the edge of the knife and the thumb. For stretching boards, I prefer a three board stretcher, but a plain board will answer. For muskrats, use a single board. Open skins are best stretched in frames or hoops, but it is all right to stretch them on the wall on the inside of a building. The boards shown in the cut are, to my notion, the proper shapes, and I would advise making a good supply of them before the season commences. [Illustration: SOME STRETCHING PATTERNS.] To use these three board stretchers, insert the two halves of the board in the skin, draw the skin down and fasten the hind legs, with tacks, to the edges of the boards. This stretches the hide long. Then insert the wedge between the two boards, which will stretch the skin out to its fullest extent, and give it the proper shape. Finish by fastening with tacks, pulling the nose over the point of the board, and drawing the skin of the lower jaw up against the nose. Hang the furs in a cool, dry place and as soon as they are dry, remove them from the boards. Fox skins should be turned with the fur side out, after removing from the board. In using the hoop stretcher, the hide is laced inside the hoop, with twine, the skin of the coon being stretched square and the beaver round. All other furs should be stretched so as not to draw them out of their natural shape. If the weather is warm and the furs are likely to taint, salt them. A salted skin is better than a tainted one. Put salt in the tail, and punch a hole in the end of the tail, with a pointed wire, to let the water drain out, or split the tail up about one-half inch from tip. The skin of the bear is, perhaps, more likely to spoil than any other, and the ears especially, are likely to taint and slip the fur. To prevent this, slit the ears open on the inside, skin then back almost to the edge and fill them with salt, also salt the base of the ears, on the flesh side of the hide. * * * [Illustration: DAKOTA TRAPPERS' METHOD.] In stretching, says a North Dakota trapper, we use a one board stretcher as follows: Put on the fur after you have fleshed it, the four feet on one side and the tail on the other. Tack down the hind feet and the tail, then take a piece of board about 1 x 1/4 inches (this would be about the correct size for a mink) rounded off except on one side. Put it below the fur on the side where the feet are, tie the front feet. When you are going to take off the fur, pull out the small board and the fur will come off easy. [Illustration: HOLDER FOR SKINNING.] A contrivance which I have found useful in skinning is made of a piece of stiff wire 18 inches long. Bend this at the middle until it has the shape of V with the ends about 8 inches apart. Bend up an inch at each end to form a hook and when skinning, after cutting around the hind feet, hook into the large tendons, hang on a nail or over limb, etc., and go ahead with both hands. The wire must be nearly as large as a slate pencil and will work all right from foxes down to mink. Trappers will find this a great help in skinning animals after they have become cold. Young trappers should use this simple device as they will be less liable to cut holes in the skin. It pays to be careful in skinning animals properly as well as to stretch them correctly, for both add to their market value. How many trappers save the skulls of their larger game? All the skulls of bear, puma or mountain lion, wolves, foxes and sometimes those of lynx and wild cat are of ready sale if they contain good sets of teeth. Several parties buy these skulls for cash. To prepare them the bulk of the flesh should be removed and the brain and eyes also. Probably the easiest way to accomplish this is to boil the skull with flesh on in an old pot until the meat begins to get tender. Then, while hot, it may easily be cut away, and by enlarging the hole at the back of the skull the brain may be scooped out. They should be watched carefully as if boiled too long the teeth drop out, bones separate and render the skull worthless. It is safe, but more tedious to clean them with a sharp knife without boiling. The dealers pay from 50 cents for a bear skull to 15 cents for a fox, tho taxidermists and furriers often pay much more. The British Columbia Government pays bounties upon the skulls, only I think this is a good idea as the skins are not mutilated and depreciated by scalping, punching or cutting as usual. Save a few good skulls and add dollars to the value of your catch. * * * Take two pieces of No. 9 fence wire about 30 inches long, writes an Ohio coon hunter and trapper, file one end sharp, then commence at each hind foot and punch the wire thru close to the edge as in sewing, taking stitches an inch or so long until you get to the front foot, then pull the hide along the wire just far enough so the top and bottom will stretch out to make it square, or a few inches longer than the width is better. [Illustration: WIRE COON METHOD.] Put 3 or 4 nails in each side, then commence at the top and tack all but the head, then pull the bottom down even with the sides, not tacking the head, which lets it draw down into the hide, then tack the head. This is an easy and good way to handle coon skins making them nearly square when stretched. Many inexperienced trappers stretch coon skins too long and draw out the head and neck. This can be avoided by following instructions given here. Coon can be cased but most dealers prefer to have them stretched open. * * * Get a lot of steel wire, says a Missouri trapper who uses old umbrella wires, the round solid ones. Sharpen one end, take your coon skin and run one wire up each side and one across each end. In putting these wires in do it like the old woman knits, that is, wrap the hide around the wire and stick it thru about every inch. Now cut six small twigs, make them the proper length and notch the ends, and you will soon have your hide stretched expert trapper style. [Illustration: WIRE AND TWIG COON METHOD.] The advantage of this is you can carry stretchers enough for twenty-five skins in one hand and don't have to hunt up a barn door and box of tacks and hammer every time you want to stretch one. You can stretch in one-fourth the time it would take to tack up on a board, and you will have it in first class style the first time and not have to pull out a tack here and stretch a little more there. * * * I have always used the whole board (not split into two pieces and wedged shape piece as some do), writes a Massachusetts trapper, and made as follows: For mink I use a 3/8 inch board about 40 inches in length, 4 inches wide at the large end, tapering to about 2 1/2 inches at the small end with the edges planed down from near the middle of the board to the edge, leaving a thin edge and sandpapered down smooth. I make the board of this length for the reason that it sometimes happens that a mink may have laid in a trap for several days before being taken out, and if under water it is not always easy to determine the exact length of time it has been in the trap, and there may be a possibility that if put on the board to dry that having laid so long it will taint before it will get thoroughly dry. I have seen them in a case of this kind where several and perhaps nearly all the hairs on the end of the tail would shed or pull out thereby damaging the skin to a greater or less extent. Now when I get a mink in this condition after pulling on the board and tacking all around, I split the tail open after which I lay it open and tack all around the same way you would with an otter skin. By employing this means you will often save the loss of the tail by thus tainting and a corresponding loss on the value of the skin. The value of the mink skin is in no way damaged by this process. Some dealers prefer to have all the skins they buy cured in this manner. For stretching the muskrat skin I also use a board of the same thickness as for mink, about 20 inches in length, 6 1/2 or 7 inches at the large end with a slightly rounding taper to a width of about 3 inches at small end, the sides planed down to a thin edge the same as for the mink boards; in fact, I prefer the same manner of stretching all cased skins, using care not to have the boards so wide as to stretch the skins to a width much exceeding the natural width before it was placed over the board, but giving them all the strain they will stand with reason, lengthwise. If stretched too wide it tends to make the fur thinner and lessens the value of it. I usually pull the skins, especially muskrats, onto the boards far enough so that the smaller end will extend through the mouth of the skin for perhaps 1/2 inch, and when the skins are sufficiently dry to remove, all that is required is to take hold of them with a hand on either edge of the skin and give it a sharp tap on the small end, when the skin will come off at once. By stretching the skins on the boards with the back on one side, belly on the opposite side, they come off the boards looking smooth and uniform in width, and command a great deal better price than if thrown on in a haphazard way on a shingle or an inch board badly shaped, as a great many beginners do. I have seen some shameful work done in this respect. It is always necessary to remove all surplus grease and fat which can readily be done immediately after the skin is stretched, otherwise they will heat, sweat and mold to a certain extent after they are removed from the boards, which injures both the appearance and sale of them. It is well to look after all these little details. These descriptions are given with the desire to help some of the beginners. If they will start in by using a little care in stretching and having pride in their work they will find the business both more pleasant and profitable. * * * If convenient when going into camp, writes an old successful trapper who has pursued the fur bearers in many states, you should take several stretching boards for your different kinds of fur with you. If not, you can generally find a tree that will split good and you can split some out. It is usually hard to find widths that are long and straight enough to bend so as to form a good shaped stretcher. You should always aim to stretch and cure furs you catch in the best manner. In skinning you should rip the animal straight from one heel across to the other and close to the roots of the tail on the under side. Work the skin loose around the bone at the base until you can grasp the bone of the tail with the first two fingers of the right hand while you place the bone between the first two fingers of the left hand. Then, by pulling you will draw the entire bone from the tail which you should always do. Sometimes when the animal has been dead for some time the bone will not readily draw from the tail. In this case cut a stick the size of your finger about eight inches long. Cut it away in the center until it will readily bend so that the two ends will come together. Then cut a notch in each part of stick just large enough to let the bone of the tail in and squeeze it out. It is necessary to whittle one side of the stick at the notch so as to form a square shoulder. You should have about three sizes of stretching boards for mink and fox. For mink they should be from 4 1/2 inches down to 3 inches and for fox from 6 1/4 inches down to 5 inches wide, and in length the fox boards may be four feet long, and the mink boards three feet long. The boards should taper slightly down to within 8 inches of the end for fox, and then rounded up to a round point. The mink boards should be rounded at 4 or 5 inches from this point. You will vary the shape of the board in proportion to the width. Stretching boards should not be more than 3/8 inch thick. A belly strip the length or nearly the length of the boards 1 1/4 inches at the wide end, tapering to a point at the other end and about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick. Have the boards smooth and even on the edges. Other stretching boards should be made in proportion to the size and shape of the animal whose skin is to be stretched. You should not fail to remove all the fat and flesh from the skin immediately after the skin is on the board. If a skin is wet when taken from the animal it should be drawn lightly on a board until the fur is quite dry. Then turn the skin flesh side out and stretch. * * * Beginning at the left, dimensions and skins stretched on the various boards are given: No. 1. Mink board, length 28 inches and 4 wide. No. 2. Mink board, length 28 inches and 3 1/2 wide. No. 3. Weasel board length 20 inches and 2 1/2 wide. No. 4. Muskrat board, length 21 inches and 6 inches wide. No. 5.

[Illustration: SIZE OF STRETCHING BOARDS.] Old and experienced hunters and trappers know about the shape and size to make the various stretching boards for the fur bearers, but for the guidance of beginners and those who are careless about stretching pelts, the above description is especially meant. Trappers in Southern sections will no doubt find the boards as described here too large for most of their skunk. In the Northeast the mink boards will also be too large, but for this section (Ohio), they are about correct. The general shape of the boards can be seen from the illustration. * * * One of the best ways, writes a Minnesota trapper, to take off the skin of an animal is by cutting the skin around the hind legs or feet, and then slitting the skin down inside the hind legs to the body joining the two slits between the hind legs, then remove the skin on the tail by pushing up the thumb nail, or a thin flat piece of wood against the bone of the tail and draw off the skin. Now commence to draw the body of the animal through the slit already made without enlarging it, drawing the skin over itself, the fur side within. When the forefeet are reached, cut the skin away from them at the wrists, and then skin over the head until the mouth is reached when the skin should be finally removed at the lips. One thing to be borne in mind when stretching a skin to dry, is that it must be drawn tight; another, that it must be stretched in a place where neither the heat of a fire or that of the sun will reach it too strongly, and it should not be washed. Large skins may be nailed on a wall of a shed or barn. The board stretcher should be made of some thin material. Prepare a board of bass wood or some other light material, two feet three inches long, three inches and a half wide at one end, and two inches and an eighth at the other, and three-eighths of an inch thick. Chamfer it from the center to the sides almost to an edge. Round and chamfer the small end about an inch upon the sides. Split the board through the center with a knife or saw, finally prepare a wedge of the same length and thickness, one inch wide at the large end, and taper to a blunt point. This is a stretcher suitable for a mink, or a marten. Two large sizes with similar proportions are required for the large animals, the largest size suitable for the full grown otter and wolf, should be five feet and a half long, seven inches wide at the large end when fully spread by the wedge, and six inches at the small end. An intermediate size is required for the fisher, raccoon, fox and some other animals, the proportions of which can be easily figured out. These stretchers require that the skin of the animal should not be ripped through the belly, but should be stripped off whole. Peel the skin from the body by drawing it over itself, leaving the fur inward. In this condition the skin should be drawn on to the split board (with the back on one side and the belly on the other), to its utmost length, and fastened with tacks, and then the wedge should be driven between the two halves. Finally, make all fast by a tack at the root of the tail, and another on the opposite side. The skin is then stretched to its utmost capacity and it may be hung away to dry. * * * Not alone the skulls of the larger animals, but the skulls of any game, the skeleton of any bird, or fish, has a ready market, provided such specimens are properly cleaned, and in perfect condition. However, the hunter or trapper must bear in mind the fact that it is the perfect specimen that is in demand, and that a bruise on the bone literally spoils it for the curator. If you will look carefully at any skull, you will notice that some of the bones are very thin and frail, almost like a spider web. These fine bones must be preserved if they are to be of any value to the Comparative Anatomist, and boiling or scraping simply ruins them. So much for the explanation. Now the method of cleaning, is by ""rotting"" rather than scraping or boiling. Take the skull (or whole head) and fix it solid in some can or jar, then fill it, or cover with water and put away for three or four weeks. At the end of that time, pour off the water and the bulk of the flesh will go too. Fill in with clear water again, and repeat as often as necessary. I have found that twice will do the work, and leave the bone in good condition. There is a market for most animal skulls, if not damaged, and it may pay to preserve all. In the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, published at Columbus, Ohio, usually will be found advertisements of parties who buy them. * * * I have never had much luck with two-piece stretchers, but use thin board stretchers in one piece with a ""sword stick"" on each side to fully stretch and admit the air to both sides of the skin. This cures the skin faster and better than when only one side is exposed to the air, says a Maryland trapper. [Illustration: POLE STRETCHERS.] When off from home, I use stretchers made from saplings, as boards suitable are not to be had everywhere, and cannot be bothered with when going light. To make these, cut osier, willow or hickory switches, straight and thick as the finger, about four feet long; cut two short pieces for rats 4 and 6 inches long and carefully bending the long piece. Nail these in with a small wire nail at each end. A handful of shingle or lath nails and a clump of osier sprouts will make a full outfit of stretchers for a temporary camp. * * * I know it is as much value in stretching your furs and preparing them for market as it is in trapping, writes a trapper. If you have no boards, go to your grocer or dry goods store and you can get all the boxes you want for 5 or 10 cents apiece. They must not be over 3/8 of an inch thick; if they are, plane them down smooth on both sides. I make what I call the two piece stretcher with a wedge for muskrats. Take a board 20 inches long, 3/8 inch thick, 6 inches wide large end, 2 1/2 inches small end. Taper back 5 inches from small end. Now take block plane and chaffer off each side an inch or more up and round it off. Round and chaffer small end the same, almost to an edge. Now draw a line thru the center of the board and saw it thru. Make a wedge the same length and thickness, 3/8 of an inch wide and tapering down to 1/10 of an inch. If a large skin, push it in between the halves. Bore a hole in large end and hang up in a cool ventilated place to dry. After three days pull out wedge, and your fur will slip right off without tearing. If the boards should warp over, tack a strip across the large end. The mink stretchers are made on the same plan. A board the same thickness, 30 inches long, 3 1/2 inches wide, taper down 2 1/8 small end round chaffer. For large mink insert wedge made one inch wide. Taper down to 2/8. For skunk and coon they are also good, only they are made on a larger scale. Now a word about casing. Pull your hide on so the back is on one side and the belly on the other. Pull nose over small end 1/2 inch. Put two tacks on each side, now pull down tight to large end and put two tacks each side, lay board on bench and take an old case knife, scrape off all meat and fat and be careful not to scrape too thin, so as not to cut the fibre of the skin. After you have scraped the flesh off, insert the wedge and your skin will be tight. Do not stretch your hide so it will make your fur look thin. * * * This is my way of stretching coon hide; use four-penny nails and use either the inside or outside of some old building, inside is the best. Drive the first nail thru nose. This holds the hide for starting. Pull each forward leg up (not out) on a level with nose and about seven or eight inches from nose according to size of the coon. Drive next nail at root of tail, and pull down, moderately tight. Now pull each hind leg out about one inch wider than the fore legs and a little below the tail nail. Now use a nail every inch and pull the hide up between the forward legs and nose, until it comes straight across. Next, treat the bottom of the hide the same as the top. Use plenty of nails. To finish down the sides, drive a nail first on one side and then on the other until finished. You will find when done that the hide is nearly square with no legs sticking out the sides and no notches in the skin. CHAPTER XXVI. HANDLING AND GRADING. MINK should be cased fur side in and stretched on boards for several days or until dry. SKUNK should be cased fur side in and stretched on boards for several days. The white stripe cut out, blackened, etc., reduces the value. RACCOON should be stretched open (ripped up the belly) and nailed on boards or the inside of a building. Some dealers allow as much for coon cased, from any section, while others prefer that only Southern coon be cased. FOXES of the various kinds should be cased and put on boards fur side in for a few days, or until dry. As the pelt is thin they soon dry, when they must be taken off and should be turned fur side out. In shipping see that they are not packed against furs flesh side out. LYNX should be cased and after drying properly are turned fur side out, same as foxes. OTTER are cased and stretched fur side in. The pelt being thick and heavy, takes several days to dry properly. They are shipped flesh side out. Sea otter are handled the same as fox, lynx and marten, that is, fur side out. BEAVER are split but stretched round and should be left in the hoop or stretcher for several days. BEAR should be handled open and stretched carefully. In skinning be careful and leave nose, claws and ears on the hide. WOLVES can be handled same as bear, also wolverine. FISHER should be cased and stretched flesh side out, but may be sent to market same as foxes or fur out. MARTEN should be stretched and dried on boards, fur side in, but turned as soon as dried. OPOSSUM are stretched on boards fur side in and are left in that condition after removing the boards. Cut the tails off when skinning--they have no value. MUSKRAT should be stretched fur side in and a few days on the boards is sufficient. They are left as taken off, that is, fur side in. Cut the tails off when skinning--they are worthless. WEASEL should be cased, fur side in. The pelts are thin and soon dry. Leave fur side in after taking off boards. BADGER are split and should be nailed to the inside of a building to dry. CIVET CAT should be cased and stretched on boards fur side in. When dry remove boards and leave fur side in. RING TAIL CATS should be cased and after removing boards are generally left fur side in for market. WILD CAT are cased and stretched on boards. They may be turned fur out or left as taken from the stretchers, fur side in. HOUSE CAT are cased and stretched on boards fur side in. They are sent to market usually fur side in. RABBITS are cased fur in and, as the pelt is thin, soon dry. They are shipped fur side in. PANTHER are treated much the same as bear. Care should be taken in skinning to leave claws, ears, nose, etc., on the skin for mounting purposes. * * * My experience has been that the house which makes only four grades of prime goods is the house that you will receive the largest checks from for your collection, writes a Michigan collector of 50 years' experience. So many grades quoted makes it possible for a firm to successfully squelch you a little every time you ship and yet you can have no reasonable excuse to complain for when you ship, you know that in some houses there is a grade for nearly every skin you send. So I, for one, would rather risk the fewer grades. A trapper from Wisconsin says: For sample, say mink are worth from 25 cents to $3.00. There would be 275 prices between the extremes. Now if he is a fur buyer I certainly pity the trappers that would have to take those 275 different prices for their mink. A man should be able to know the difference between grades No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and when he does he is then able to give a fair and honest price for every skin he buys. If he doesn't know the difference then, he had better get a job clerking in a hotel or sawing wood. * * * Many have requested that the difference in the various grades of skins be explained and for their benefit, as well as others of little experience, the following may prove instructive. Raw furs are assorted into four grades, viz: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4. With the exception of skunk and muskrat most houses subdivide the No. 1 skins into large, medium and small. In addition to this many firms quote a range of prices about as follows: Mink, Northern New York, large $6.00 to $8.00. Would it not be more satisfactory to quote one price only? It is generally known that Minnesota mink are large. From that state a No. 1 medium mink is as large as a No. 1 large from Maine, where mink are rather small. But as the dealers on their price lists quote the various states and sections, why not quote one price only as follows: MINK, NORTHERN NEW YORK, NO. 1. Large, Medium, Small, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, $7.00. $5.00. $3.00 $1.50. $0.75. $0.20 These figures, of course, are only given for illustration and are not meant to show value. Furs from the various parts of North America have their peculiar characteristics and it is easy for the man of experience to tell in what part of the country a pelt was caught. It may be shipped by a collector hundreds of miles from where caught, but if there are many in the collection the expert will soon detect it. This knowledge, however, only comes with years of experience. Prime skins are those caught during cold weather and the pelt after drying a few days is bright and healthy appearing. Unprime skins are those that turn blue or black after being stretched for a time. Usually the darker the pelt the poorer the fur. If only slightly blued the pelt may go back only one grade, while if black it is apt to be no better than No. 3 or No. 4 and may be trash of no value. Springy skins, as the name indicates, are those taken toward the last of the season or in the spring and tho often prime pelted, have begun to shed. The beginner is often deceived, for he thinks if the pelt is prime, the fur is. Foxes and other animals are often ""rubbed"" toward spring, which of course lessens their value. A No. 1 skin must be not only average in size but free from cuts, etc. No unprime skin will grade better than No. 2. Skunk, to be No. 1 or black, must be prime in pelt, fair size and stripe not extending beyond the shoulders. The day that only ""star black"" were taken for No. 1 is passed, for most trappers and shippers know better now. A No. 2, or short striped skunk, is prime and the stripes, if narrow, may extend nearly to the tail. A small No. 1 or a blued No. 1 is graded No. 2. A No. 3 or long stripe has two stripes extending the entire length, but there must be as much black between the stripes as either of the white stripes. In some of the states, such as Minnesota, Iowa, the Dakotas, etc., skunk are large and are nearly all striped the same--long narrow stripes--but owing to their size they are worth about the same as the eastern short stripe or No. 2. A No. 4, broad or white skunk, is prime but has two broad stripes extending down the back. Most dealers class skunk as No. 4 if either white stripe contains more white than there is black between the two stripes. All unprime skunk are graded down to No. 2, 3 and 4 according to depth of fur and stripe. A No. 1 skunk in stripe, but blue, becomes a No. 2, or if badly blued No. 3 or 4; a No. 2 skunk in stripe but blue becomes a No. 3; a No. 3 in stripe but blue, a No. 4; a No. 4 in stripe but blue generally goes into trash. In fact, if badly blued, any of the grades may be thrown to trash. Muskrat are assorted into four grades--spring, winter, fall and kitts. Spring rats are known as No. 1; winter, No. 2; fall, No. 3; Kitts, No. 4. No. 1 or spring rats are those taken in March and April. The pelt is then of a reddish color and is entirely free from dark spots. A few spring rats may be caught earlier than March, but so long as they show dark spots they are not No. 1. No. 2, or winter rats, are pretty well furred, but there are dark streaks and spots in the hide usually on the back. No. 3 or fall are not full furred and the pelt is far from prime. The dark streaks show much more than later in the season. No. 4, or kitts, are only partly grown or if larger are badly damaged. Opossum is the only animal that may have a ""prime"" pelt but an ""unprime"" coat of fur. This makes opossum rather difficult to assort unless turned fur side out. If opossum have been properly skinned and stretched they will, when unprime, show a dark blue spot on the under side at the throat. The plainer this spot the poorer the fur. Good unprime skins are No. 2; poor unprime skins, No. 3; the very poor and stagey, no fur, are No. 4, generally known as trash and of no value. The other fur-bearers, such as mink, otter, beaver, fox, wolves, lynx, wild cat, fisher, raccoon, bear, badger, civet cat, weasel, etc., are graded much the same that is, all skins to be No. 1 must be caught in season, when the fur is prime, at which time the ""pelt"" is healthy appearing--never blue or black--must be of average size, correctly skinned, handled and free of cuts or shot holes. Skins may be unprime from several causes, viz: caught too early, improperly handled, under size, etc. Unprime skins are graded No. 2, 3 and 4 according to how inferior they are. The fairly well furred unprime skins are graded No. 2; the low furred unprime skins are thrown to No. 3; the poorly furred are thrown to No. 4, while low stagey skins go to trash. Some skins altho prime are so small that they grade No. 3. This, however, is the exception rather than the rule. Usually if prime, the under size will only put the skin down one grade. * * * I have bought some for a number of years, writes a collector, and know that some trappers are like some farmers, they want as much money for a bushel of dirty wheat as their neighbor gets for a bushel of clean wheat. I have had skunk and opossum hides offered me that had a pound or two of tainted fat on them, and skins that were taken out of season, for which they expect to get No. 1 prices. There are some who stretch their skins in the shape of an oblong triangle and leave flesh enough on to make their dinner. Stretch your hides as near the shape of the animal as possible; don't try to make a muskrat hide as long as a mink, or a mink as wide as a muskrat. Catch in season, flesh carefully, stretch in good shape, always take bone out of tails, keep in an airy building until dry and then you will not have to grumble so much at the buyer in regard to prices. CHAPTER XXVII. FROM ANIMAL TO MARKET. Under this title, says an experienced Western trapper, I shall endeavor to show my brother trappers how to handle pelts: As soon as I get in from my traps (I use a team and wagon), I feed team, dogs and self, then I proceed to skin the game in the usual manner; when game is all skinned I put on my fleshing suit, made of rubber cloth like that buggy curtains are made of, get out my fleshing boards, of which I have three sizes--large, medium and small--for each kind of cased skins except rat, which I flesh with thumb and knife. The fleshing boards are like Fig. 1 on enclosed diagram, made of 1 inch pine free from knots and dressed on both sides, 3 feet 6 inches long, and for skunk 3/4 in. and 10 in. wide, tapered up to a blunt point, edges rounded and sandpapered smooth. These boards can be made of other sizes so as to fit larger or smaller pelts of other kinds. [Illustration: FLESHING BOARD.] For a flesher I have tried nearly everything imaginable, dull knives, hardwood scrapers, etc., but have abandoned them all for the hatchet. I use an old lath hatchet head and use it tolerably sharp; I proceed as follows: Put pelt on board but do not fasten, grip lower edge with left hand, pull down hard, place point of board against breast and use hatchet with right, pushing down and holding hatchet nearly flat; use plenty of elbow grease; as fast as you get a strip cleaned off turn hide a little but do not flesh on edge of board. It may not work good at first and you may cut one or two hides, but you will soon get the knack. [Illustration: STRETCHING FRAME.] If possible take a bitch skunk for the first as they flesh easier, and be sure there are no burrs or chunks of mud in the fur, or you will cut a hole the size of the burr. Now for the stretchers. In Fig. 2 is what I use; it is something of my own invention, and there is no patent on it. It is made of any wood that will split straight, and the dimensions are as follows: Pieces are 4 ft. long by 1 3/8 in. dressed smooth; pieces are 1 1/2 X 3/8 in.; will say for large skunks here they would be 10 in. and 4 1/2 in. To frame you must soak or steam the long pieces; mitre the ends and fasten with 3d finishing nails clinched. Then place in position 1 in. from ends and fasten with two 6d finishing nails; place in position and pull up to 8 in. from nose and fasten: now chamfer off edges and sandpaper smooth. I like this stretcher, as it airs both sides of pelt and will dry them in half the time. Fig 3 shows manner of fastening pelt; on belly side it can be drawn down and fastened to tail pieces with sack needle and twine; it is made of two or more poles fastened in the shape of a hoop. In shipping furs, bale tight; do not ship loose in sack; place mink and rat inside of skunk and other fur, and always place the toughest pelts on outside. By bailing tight you will avoid crinkling and they will not look mussy and will bring from 5 to 10 per cent more. Now, brother trappers, fleshing pelts, as I understand it, is not merely taking the fat off, but in going deeper and taking the flesh clean from the pelt so that if skunk, the stripe will show clear the full length and reducing the weight by half. On February 2nd. I shipped 15 skunk, all large; the lot only weighed 9 pounds including sack. [Illustration: SKIN ON STRETCHER.] When stretching skunk and otter skins, if the weather is warm, split the tails, open and tack flat. Split open half way all others that have fur tails. Open pelts can be stretched in hoops made of one or more poles an inch or so in diameter, and sewed in with a sack needle and heavy twine. In stretching do not get the pelt so wide that the fur looks thin, or so long and narrow that it looks as if a horse had been hitched to each end. Keep the natural shape of the animal as much as possible, dry in a cool, airy place inside, or on the north side of a building and away from fire. Baling--here is where the expert trapper shows his craft, and in baling you will see him wipe off all surplus fat and dirt and place the heavy pelts on the outside of his pack. The lighter furs, such as mink, marten, cat, etc., will be placed inside of the skins that are heavier. For instance: From four to eight rats or mink, inside of a fox or skunk. He will place the head of one to the tail of another, the tails folded in. He now ties a cord tightly around each end, placing them on a square of burlap, and with sack needle and twine draws up the sides as tight as he can; then he folds in the ends and sews up snug. Furs thus packed reach the market in good shape, and not such as they would if crammed promiscuously into a sack. [Illustration: WRAP WITH WIRE AT JOINTS.] In conclusion, boys, let me suggest a maxim or two for your guidance: ""Prime caught and well handled furs always bring top prices."" ""Take pride in your catch, no matter how small."" While the heading of this chapter is ""From Animal to Market"" it is well when shipping to request the dealer to grade and send value. If satisfactory, write to send on check. If not satisfactory, have dealer return furs. When shipping furs under these conditions see that no green skins are sent--only properly cured ones. While some dealers offer to pay expressage both ways we hardly think this fair and if no deal is made the dealer should pay the expressage one way and the shipper the other. The Hunter-Trader-Trapper, published at Columbus, Ohio, in the interests of hunters, trappers and dealers in raw furs contains a great deal of information that will be of value along the line of shipping furs as well as trapping methods, etc. CHAPTER XXVIII. STEEL TRAPS. This book would not be complete without at least a few pages devoted to steel traps. While a few steel traps were in use prior to 1850, yet it has only been since that date that they have come into general use. During recent years they have become cheaper and trappers in all parts of America are using them in greater numbers. Professional trappers in the North, Northwest and Southwest often have out lines many miles long and use 200 to 350 steel traps of the various sizes. Each of the three main sets--land, water and snow are used in various ways and to describe all of these would require a book. Steel traps are made in various sizes from No. 0 to No. 6, to meet the requirements of trappers for the various animals. The best traps manufactured are the Newhouse made by the well-known trap manufacturers--Oneida Community, Ltd., Oneida, N. Y. A brief description of these follows: [Illustration: Newhouse No. 0 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 3 1/2 inches. This, the smallest trap made, is used mostly for catching the gopher, a little animal which is very troublesome to western farmers, and also rats and other vermin. It has a sharp grip and will hold larger game, but should not be overtaxed. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 1 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. This Trap is used for catching muskrats and other small animals, and sold in greater numbers than any other size. Its use is well understood by professional trappers and it is the most serviceable size for catching skunks, weasels, rats and such other animals as visit poultry houses and barns. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 81 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. Occasionally animals free themselves from traps by gnawing their legs off just below the trap jaws, where the flesh is numb from pressure. Various forms of traps have been experimented with to obviate this difficulty. The Webbed Jaws shown above have proved very successful in this respect. Noting the cross-section of the jaws, as illustrated at the left, it is plain the animal can only gnaw off its leg at a point quite a distance below the meeting edges. The flesh above the point of amputation and below the jaws will swell and make it impossible to pull the leg stump out of the trap. The No. 81 Trap corresponds in size with the regular No. 1 Newhouse. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 91 Trap] Spread of Jaws--91, 5 1/4 inches; 91 1/2, 6 1/4 inches. The double jaws take an easy and firm grip so high up on the muskrat that he can not twist out. A skunk cannot gnaw out either. These traps are especially good for muskrat, mink, skunk and raccoon. All parts of the No. 91 except the jaws are the same size as the regular No. 1 Newhouse, while the 91 1/2 corresponds to the regular No. 1 1/2. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 1 1/2 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. This size is called the Mink Trap. It is, however, suitable for catching the woodchuck, skunk, etc. Professional trappers often use it for catching foxes. It is very convenient in form and is strong and reliable. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 2 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. The No. 2 Trap is called the Fox Trap. Its spread of jaws is the same as the No. 1 1/2 but having two springs it is, of course, much stronger. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 3 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 5 1/2 inches. This, the Otter Trap, is very powerful. It will hold almost any game smaller than a bear. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 4 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This is the regular form of Beaver Trap. It is longer than the No. 3 Trap, and has one inch greater spread of jaws. It is a favorite with those who trap and hunt for a living in the Northwest and Canada. It is also extensively used for trapping the smaller wolves and coyotes in the western stock raising regions. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 2 1/2 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. In some localities the otter grows to an unusual size, with great proportionate strength, so that the manufacturers have been led to produce an especially large and strong pattern. All the parts are heavier than the No. 2 1/2, the spread of jaws greater and the spring stiffer. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 3 1/2 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 5 inches. The above cut represents a Single Spring Otter Trap. It is used more especially for catching otter on their ""slides."" For this purpose a thin, raised plate of steel is adjusted to the pan so that when the trap is set the plate will be a trifle higher than the teeth on the jaws. The spring is very powerful, being the same as used on the No. 4 Newhouse Trap. The raised plate can be readily detached if desired, making the trap one of general utility. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 21 1/2 Trap] Single Spring. Same as No. 2 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate. No. 31 1/2 NEWHOUSE TRAP. Single Spring. Same as No. 3 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate. Spread of Jaws--No. 21 1/2, 5 1/4 inches; No. 31 1/2, 6 1/2 inches. These Traps are the largest smooth jaw, single spring sizes that are made. Professional trappers will find these especially valuable when on a long trapping line, as they are more compact and easier to secrete than the large double spring traps. The springs are made extra heavy. Note.--The 21 1/2 is practically a single spring No. 3 and the 31 1/2 a single spring No. 4. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 14 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This Trap is the same in size as the No. 4 Beaver, but has heavier and stiffer springs and offset jaws, which allow the springs to raise higher when the animal's leg is in the trap, and is furnished with teeth sufficiently close to prevent the animal from pulling its foot out. [Illustration: Clutch Detachable Trap] Clutch Detachable--Trap can be used with or without it. Spread of Jaws, No. 23, 5 1/2 inches; No. 24, 6 1/4 inches. The inventor of this attachment claims to have had wonderful success with it in taking beaver. The trap should be set with the clutch end farthest from shore. The beaver swims with his fore legs folded back against his body, and when he feels his breast touch the bank he puts them down. The position of the trap can be so calculated that he will put his fore legs in the trap, when the clutch will seize him across the body and hold him securely. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 4 1/2 Trap] In response to a demand for a new model of the Newhouse Trap especially adapted to catching wolves, the manufacturers have perfected a trap which is numbered 4 1/2 and is called the ""Newhouse Wolf Trap."" This trap has eight inches spread of jaw, with other parts in proportion, and is provided with a pronged ""drag,"" a heavy snap and an extra heavy steel swivel and chain, five feet long, warranted to hold 2,000 pounds. The trap complete with chain and ""drag"" weighs about nine pounds. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 50 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is intended for catching small sized bears. In design it is exactly like the standard No. 5 Bear Trap, only that the parts are all somewhat smaller. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 150 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is identical with No. 5 excepting that the jaws are offset, making a space five-eighths inch between them. This allows the springs to come up higher when the bear's foot is in the trap, and thus secure a better grip. Also there is less chance of breaking the bones of the foot. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 5 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. This trap weighs nineteen pounds. It is used for taking the common black bear and is furnished with a very strong chain. [Illustration: Newhouse No. 15 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. To meet the views of certain hunters whose judgment is respected, the manufacturers designed a style of jaw for the No. 5 trap, making an offset of 3/4 of an inch, so as to allow the springs to come up higher when the bear's leg is in the trap. This gives the spring a better grip. Those wishing this style should specify ""No. 15."" [Illustration: Newhouse No. 6 Trap] Spread of Jaws, 16 inches. Weight, complete, 42 pounds. This is the strongest trap made. We have never heard of anything getting out of it when once caught. It is used to catch lions and tigers, as well as the great Grizzly Bears of the Rocky Mountains. [Illustration: Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt] This cut illustrates Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt, intended as a substitute for the ring on the end of the trap chain, when desired. With this clevis a loop can be made around any small log or tree without the trouble of cutting to fit the ring. The chain is made five feet long, suitable for any clog, and the prices of bear traps fitted with it are the same as with the regular short chain and ring. [Illustration: Steel Trap Setting Clamp] Every trapper knows how difficult it is to set a large trap alone in the woods, especially in cold weather, when the fingers are stiff, and the difficulty is greatly increased when one has to work in a boat. One of these clamps applied to each spring will by a few turns of the thumb-screws, bend the springs to their places, so that the pan may be adjusted without difficulty. No. 4 Clamp can be used on any trap smaller than No. 4 1 /2. No. 5 and 6 are strong clamps, carefully made and especially adapted to setting the large traps Nos. 4 1/2 to 6. They dispense with the inconvenient and dangerous use of levers. With them one can easily set these powerful traps. These clamps are also useful about camp for other purposes.

A GUIDE FOR THE STUDY OF ANIMALS BY A COMMITTEE FROM THE BIOLOGY ROUND TABLE OF THE CHICAGO HIGH SCHOOLS WORRALLO WHITNEY, Chairman BOWEN HIGH SCHOOL FREDERIC C. LUCAS ENGLEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL HAROLD B. SHINN SCHURZ HIGH SCHOOL MABEL E. SMALLWOOD LANE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL D. C. HEATH & CO., PUBLISHERS BOSTON -- NEW YORK -- CHICAGO Copyright, 1911, By D. C. Heath & Co. 1 E 3 PREFACE The following guide to the study of animals is intended for pupils in secondary schools. It was prepared by the authors at the request of the Biology Round Table, an association composed of the teachers of Biology in the Chicago High Schools, to whom the authors wish to take this opportunity of expressing their appreciation of the many helpful suggestions and criticisms of the manuscript. The time has passed when a high school course in zoÃ¶logy consists simply of a somewhat simplified edition of a similar course in college. All teachers now recognize that the motivization of any course should be its adaptability to the needs of the student, and that zoÃ¶logy must be taught from the standpoint of the student rather than that of the subject. In preparing this guide, the authors have tried to keep these points in mind. The matter of presentation, the order of topics, and the choice of material has been much discussed, but the trend of opinion has finally set in toward an ecological rather than a type study of animals; that there should be in the case of young students a brief study of rather a large number of animals to bring out some general biological law, rather than an exhaustive study of a very few types. It is further recognized that the use of a reference library is absolutely essential in connection with and to supplement the laboratory work, as there are some topics beyond the ability of the young student for original investigation as well as impossible in the amount of time usually allotted to the subject in our crowded curricula. Of great importance is the economic side of zoÃ¶logy, especially its bearing upon the applied sciences of medicine, sanitation, household science, and agriculture, and this phase has received special attention in this guide. The desirability of field work has always been recognized, but the special conditions under which schools must work are so variable as to make any set directions for field work of little value, and so they have in most cases been omitted in this work. Each teacher can easily give such special direction for collecting material and study in the field as the locality of the school and the time available for it shall determine. Since zoÃ¶logy will probably be the pupil's first laboratory science, the authors have preceded the more formal portion of the manual with a series of short exercises on familiar and easily obtained animals in order to introduce the pupil to the laboratory method and to stimulate his interest, training him at the outset to be constantly on the outlook for specimens and to show him how much may be learned from common things right around him, if he will only use his eyes. We have also begun the more formal portion of the guide with insects, since in the fall they are easily collected and may be studied alive. They illustrate, moreover, the principles of classification and method of using keys and other means of finding out the names of animals. This would seem to be pedagogically sound, for some recent experiments with pupils show that the first question that comes into a child's mind upon seeing a new or strange specimen is ""What is it?"" A larger portion of the guide is given to the chordates than is usually the case. The authors also believe that this is correct and in accord with the natural interest of the pupil. It will serve to connect his zoÃ¶logy more closely with his daily experiences. There is material enough provided to allow the teacher a chance to select that best adapted to his purposes or conditions as well as to provide for those schools that give more than one year to zoÃ¶logy.

CHAPTER VIII POULTRY 182 * * * * * GLOSSARY 189 A GUIDE FOR THE STUDY OF ANIMALS CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY STUDIES OF LIVING ANIMALS In the following brief exercises the primary purpose is to arouse an active, attentive interest on the part of the pupil in various forms of animal life which may be at hand, reminding him of what and how various creatures eat, how they breathe, how they get ideas of the world, how they get about, and perhaps how they succeed where others fail. Of secondary importance is the introduction of laboratory methods by easy stages. The pupil should feel that his natural curiosity is only being directed to definite ends and that he is free to investigate in his own way. The types here given are only a few of the many to be found in the early fall, and these exercises in several cases may be used for other forms than those definitely mentioned. There should be a great deal of promiscuous collecting by the class, and in the mass of material gathered the following types will probably be fairly abundant. THE LIVING FLY _Materials._ Living flies in cages and individual specimens in small wide-mouth vials with cotton stoppers for the admission of air. Sugar crystals may be used for feeding. Simple lenses. _Observations._ Notice the division of the body into three regions: head, thorax, and abdomen. The six legs, the large wings, and the small feelers may be easily found, as are the large eyes, the extensible mouth, and beneath the larger wings the small undeveloped ones looking like tiny knobs. 1. State the general color of your specimen and give any special markings on its body. 2. Is the body smooth or has it a covering of any kind? Do you regard the fly as a cleanly animal? Why? 3. Under what conditions does the fly use its legs? its wings? What enables it to walk upside down? What use can you assign to the small wings? 4. Judging by the relative size of the feelers and the eyes, do you think the fly relies more upon its sight or its feeling? Since the eyes can probably see you any place where you see them, determine through how much of a circle the fly can see. 5. How does the fly eat? Does it eat solid or liquid food? 6. Where is the extensible mouth (_proboscis_) kept when not in use? What is the fly doing when ""washing its face""? 7. From your own observation in the barn and the alley what do you know about the fly's cleanliness in choosing its food? How would it affect articles in the pantry? 8. From the foregoing statements show how flies may be a serious factor in dealing with disease. 9. What means may be employed as protection against adult flies? against their breeding places and ""maggots""? _Suggested drawing._ a. The entire fly, seen from above, Ã 4. THE LIVING MAGGOT _Materials._ Living specimens in pans or cotton-stoppered bottles, with some food material and moist cloth or paper; lenses. _Observations._ Notice the general worm-like form of the maggot, or grub, the plain and uniform color, and the absence of all elaborate structures, as wings and feelers. 1. Since this creature is destined to become a flying or walking insect, what organs will have to appear? Is there any indication of these structures at present? 2. Give the color of the specimen, and explain how the presence or absence of strong light seems to have affected the color. Is this effect usual in animals or plants that you know? 3. Tell how the animal gets from place to place, describing any special structures you find which aid in this work. 4. How can you tell the head end? Tell how the amount of work that the mouth and mouth parts do affects their size and indirectly that of the region where they are. 5. What senses and sense organs has the maggot? Test any of these senses or organs gently, by any means at your disposal, or recall any experience you have had along this line. Which senses or organs seem to be best developed? 6. Explain briefly how the active or sluggish habits either determine or are determined by the condition of the senses or sense organs. 7. Since ""Mother Nature"" seems to want maggots to develop rapidly, tell how she economizes in energy and material when forming them. 8. Show how the development of maggots in refuse matter is actually beneficial. 9. From the standpoint of flies and human welfare, show why maggots should not be allowed to live,--stating how they may be prevented. 10. Look up the story of the pupa of the house fly; the development and work of the botfly; of the ox-warble; of the tsetse fly. _Suggested drawing._ a. The maggot or grub, side view, Ã 4. THE LIVING COCKROACH _Materials._ Individual specimens in cages, jars, or wide-mouth vials with cotton stoppers to admit air. Several roaches in large cages with material for food and concealment. _Observations._ 1. What is the general color and the average size of cockroaches? 2. During what time of the day are roaches most active? Where do they hide at other times? How do their shape and color aid concealment? Note any odd or striking colors or marks which might make them distinguishable to their mates. 3. Is the roach a quick or a slow moving animal? How does it get about,--by running, jumping, walking, crawling, swimming, or flying? Turn your specimen on its back and see how it recovers its proper position. Notice the relative size and development of the wings and their use in flying. 4. If uninjured, your specimen has six legs. Why don't they step on each other? Notice the stiff hairs on the legs and the white pads under the feet. How would these structures be useful to the animal? 5. The large, black, shiny eyes are on the front and sides of the head; the long ""horns,"" or feelers, are attached just below the eyes. Upon which sense, sight or feeling, do you think the roach depends more? Explain your statement. 6. Beside the mouth are a long and a short pair of ""feelers""; perhaps these are for tasting or smelling. What do roaches like to eat? Do they choose their food? What damage do they do? 7. How can a house be rid of cockroaches? _Suggested drawing._ a. A cockroach, seen from above. THE LIVING SPIDER _Materials._ Living spiders, preferably large ones, in cages; individual specimens in battery jars or wide-mouth bottles. Cocoons. Simple lenses. _Observations._ Each pupil may feel sure that if treated fairly any of the common spiders may be handled without fear of bite or injury. 1. Note that the spider's body is of two regions, the head-thorax and the abdomen, and that it is supported by eight legs. To what part of the body are the legs attached? 2. Find the feelers; if they are club-shaped, your specimen is a male. State their number and tell where they are attached. What is the sex of your spider? 3. Usually there are eight tiny near-sighted eyes on the front of the head. State the color of the eyes and by a diagram indicate their arrangement. 4. With what kind of material is the body covered (use the lens)? 5. What is the color of your specimen? What special markings has it? Find out the name of your kind of spider. 6. Holding the spider aloft in your fingers, allow it to drop upon the thread it will spin, and watch it climb and spin. Record the number of the spinners, their situation, and how they act. Are the threads sticky? If so, why doesn't the spider stick to its web? Is the web used for a home or for a snare? 7. Try to discover how the feet are enabled to cling to the thread. 8. Examine a cocoon, noting its outer form and structure, and look for an opening at the top. If you can open a cocoon carefully with scissors, look for its two coats and inspect its contents. 9. State three uses for the spider's silk. 10. What is the work of spiders amongst the animal population of the earth, or of what use are they? 11. Out of doors find webs of various kinds: wheel web, tent web, triangle web, etc. 12. How do the jumping spiders differ from others in their spinning and feeding habits? 13. Look up what is meant by ballooning spiders. Find out when ballooning occurs and what is accomplished by it. _Suggested drawings._ a. The entire spider, seen from above. b. A cocoon. THE LIVING CRICKET _Materials._ Living crickets in cages, with materials for food and concealment, and individual specimens in wide-mouth bottles or vials with cotton stoppers. _Observations._ 1. What is the average size and the general color of crickets? 2. Just what do they do when you try to catch them? What structures enable them to do these things? 3. Of the three pairs of legs, which extend sidewise for running or grasping, and which backward for jumping or climbing? What structures have the legs to enable them to do their work properly? 4. Notice how well developed the cricket's wings are, and state how much they are used or how they influence the habits of the animal. 5. How many projecting spines are there on the hinder end of the body? Are they ornamental or useful? how? The female crickets have a special spear-shaped spine for depositing eggs. 6. In a column make a list of the senses (sight, feeling, etc.), and opposite each state what kind of an organ is used and where it is located. The ears are oblong white spots on the second long piece of the front legs. 7. Find out whether the cricket chews solid food or sucks liquid food, and whether it has biting jaws or protrusible lips. See whether it will attack a toothpick or your finger, and if the crickets have been confined long, whether there has been any attempt at cannabalism. Is its natural food animal or vegetable matter? 8. How do crickets chirp? 9. What work do they do in nature? 10. How does a baby cricket develop? THE LIVING GRASSHOPPER OR LOCUST _Materials._ Individual specimens in wide-mouth bottles or jars, and other specimens in cages, with turf or foliage for food and concealment. Simple lenses. _Observations._ Notice the form and size of your specimen, its color, the number of its legs and of its feelers. Find the eyes; the two large eyes, a tiny one between the two feelers, and near the inner edge of each large eye, another tiny one. With a lens notice the markings on the large eyes. Find the mouth, and note its lips and finger-like feelers. Draw out an outer wing, and then carefully draw out the delicate under wing, allowing them both to fold into place again. Under the wings find the circular or crescent-shaped membranes, the eardrums. Watch the grasshopper's body expand and contract in breathing, and find the small breathing holes along each side the body. Compare its rate of breathing with your own. _Questions._ 1. In what surroundings and how does the grasshopper's color protect it? What color markings has it which might serve for other grasshoppers to see as signals? Explain how this signaling is done. 2. Explain how the legs are placed so as to act as springs in jumping and alighting. 3. What advantages in having the wings attached on the upper side and the legs on the under side of the body? 4. Explain how the small wings are protective, and how the large ones are protected. 5. Why is it better for the grasshopper to have its mouth on the under side of its head instead of in front? 6. The large eyes are supposed to be far-sighted, the small ones near-sighted. State how the large eyes have the more advantageous position, and around how much of a circle they can see. 7. Describe how the grasshopper breathes. THE LIVING BUTTERFLY OR MOTH _Materials._ Individual specimens in large jars or cages, and other specimens in cages with foliage; simple lenses and a needle or pin. _Observations._ Butterflies may generally be distinguished from moths by their habit of holding their wings together above them when at rest, by the feelers which are knobbed at the end, and by the rather slender abdomen. Moths generally either fold their wings or hold them outstretched, their feelers are not knobbed, and their bodies are rather bulky. Observe these points in your specimen and the colors of the upper and under sides of the wings. Find the large eyes and examine them with a lens. With the needle or pin carefully uncoil the sucking tube which you may find under the head between two shields. Note the fuzziness of the body and the ""dust"" which covers the wings. Examine some of this dust under a lens. _Questions._ 1. Is your specimen a butterfly or a moth? Prove your statement. If possible, give the name of your specimen. 2. Write a description of your specimen--its size, general color, and special color pattern. 3. Describe the sucking tube, or ""proboscis,"" and name some flowers from which it might obtain nectar. Try to find out how the tube is operated. 4. Why is it that moths and butterflies never bite? Do they sting? How do you think they protect themselves from enemies? 5. State how the fuzz and dust on your specimen might influence a bird's liking for it. 6. Contrast the size and usefulness of the wings of the butterfly with those of some other insect you know about; contrast their legs; state how development of one set of structures may cause another set to be simple or feeble. 7. Most moths are active by night. What explanation can you give for their large eyes and expanded feelers? Feelers of insects may be for any or all of the following: touch, taste, smell, and hearing. _Suggested drawings._ a. The butterfly or moth. b. An antenna (feeler). THE LIVING CATERPILLAR _Materials._ Living caterpillars in cages or covered jars for individual study, and other specimens in cages with foliage for food or concealment. _Observations._ The pupil should observe the general form and external construction of the caterpillar, watching it feeding, in action, and at rest. Notice how the creature moves. Find its head, its segments (similar divisions of the body), and its breathing holes along the sides of the body. Try to find its eyes, any feelers, wings or paddles. Try to loosen it from its support; find the tiny hooks on the feet for clinging fast. _Questions._ 1. Give the general color of your specimen and explain how this color may make it conspicuous or may aid its concealment. 2. Describe the outer surface or covering of the caterpillar. What structures, if any, are there, which might make the animal distasteful or inedible? 3. How many pairs of legs are there? How are they distributed along the body? Counting the segments, state which ones bear no legs. 4. To what extent do the legs act in locomotion? Are they mere organs for attachment while the body swings forward and backward, or do the legs do this, as in a horse? Make a complete statement. 5. Notice the openings of the internal breathing tubes. How are they protected against dust and other foreign matter? 6. Does the caterpillar seem to be a warm-blooded animal? State how the free access of air along the body would influence internal temperature. 7. What do you know about a caterpillar's appetite? How might caterpillars be beneficial or harmful? What means has nature of holding their numbers in check? 8. Recalling that caterpillars finally ""sleep"" for several days or weeks and awaken as winged creatures, how can you account for their appetites? THE TUSSOCK MOTH _Materials._ Directions for the study of the caterpillar stage will be found in the exercise ""The Living Caterpillar,"" and directions for the study of the adult male form will be found in the exercise ""The Living Butterfly or Moth."" The female tussock moth is a wingless, thick-bodied creature, gray in color, very downy, and about three fourths of an inch long. The following directions apply more particularly to the study of the cocoons and the general harmfulness of the tussock moth. This exercise may be done best outside of the classroom, the pupil answering the questions on scrap paper and rewriting these notes in the laboratory. Living caterpillars, cocoons, some of them bearing their frothy masses of wax and eggs, pupÃ¦, and adult moths of both sexes may be used in the laboratory. _Observations and Questions._ 1. On what kinds of trees are the cocoons and the caterpillars generally found? What effect have the caterpillars on the trees, and what may possibly be the final effect upon the trees of the locality or the entire district? 2. Upon what part of the tree are the cocoons made, and why? Where on the bark are they, and why? 3. Is the opening of the cocoon at the upper or the lower end? What reason can you assign for this? 4. Count the number of cocoons upon the entire tree or estimate it by counting those upon a part of the tree. Now count the number of eggs on a cocoon. Assuming that one half of the cocoons bear eggs, calculate the number of caterpillars on a tree next year. 5. How is the waxy covering of the eggs a particularly good protection against winter weather? 6. Investigate the interiors of several cocoons and state what you find. 7. On the pupa find the jointed and tapering hinder end, abdomen, and at the head region and lying along the under side, the marks of the legs and the feelers, and possibly the wings, all pressed close against the body. Find also the breathing pores along the sides of the abdomen. 8. Unlikeness between male and female is called ""sexual dimorphism."" Explain how the tussock moth shows this. For what work does each form seem particularly adapted? 9. What methods would you use that the tussock moth might be destroyed or kept out of a community? The numerous small worm-like creatures often found are the caterpillar stages of another insect, an ichneumon fly, which laid its eggs under the skin of the tussock caterpillar. How has their development affected that of the tussock moth? What great result does nature accomplish by this arrangement? _Suggested drawings._ a. A caterpillar, Ã 2. b. A cocoon with its egg mass. c. A pupa as seen from the under side. d. An adult moth, either male or female. THE LIVING BEETLE _Materials._ Living beetles in cages, together with portions of the plant upon which they are found; or if water beetles are used, they should be kept in aquaria. Individual specimens in battery jars or wide-mouth bottles, and preserved beetles in pans or vials for reference. _Observations._ 1. Upon what plant or in what surroundings is your kind of beetle generally found? If you can, give its common name. 2. What is the length, breadth, and thickness of your beetle? Would you describe it as a ""small"" insect or a ""large"" one? 3. Of what general color is it? Describe any color markings you see. 4. If any of the legs differ from the others or are of peculiar shape or length, describe them and tell what you think they may be fitted to do. 5. As a rule, beetles have harder ""shells"" than other insects. Does this shell completely inclose the body, or can you find any soft parts exposed? How are the head, thorax, and abdomen joined so as to carry out the apparent purpose of protection? What is the outline of the body--a continuous line or one with many irregularities? 6. If possible, try to lift up one side of the ""shell"" from the hinder end of the body. You will discover that this portion of the shell is a pair of hard sheath wings, and beneath them is another pair. How are the under ones unlike the upper in size and texture? in use? in arrangement when not in use? 7. Does a beetle spend most of its life on the wing, like bees and flies? How might the body covering and the structure of the outer wings affect or determine the beetle's habits, even against its will? 8. Are the feelers or are the eyes of your specimen more easily distinguished? Upon which of the special senses does it seem to place most dependence? 9. Is your kind of beetle good for anything, either in nature or in human affairs? Make a statement regarding what good or what harm it may do. THE DAMSEL FLY LARVA _Materials._ Living larvÃ¦ of the damsel fly in shallow watch glasses of water for individual use, and others in large pans or aquaria. Simple lenses or dissecting microscopes. _Observations._ 1. What is the color and the shape of the larva? how long is it? Notice in what surroundings in the water the larva lives, and answer to yourself how its form and color would protect it in those surroundings. 2. Since the larva is an insect, though immature, its body is composed of three regions: head, thorax, and abdomen. How do these regions differ from each other? 3. What structures has your specimen to enable it to move from place to place? If fully developed wings are not present, what indication is there of their being formed? 4. What sense organs has the larva? Which ones seem to be the largest and most useful? 5. Although the aquatic larva is preparing for adult life in the air, there should be some arrangement for securing air in the water. Where do you find outgrowths of the skin which might increase the air-absorbing surface? How many of these structures are there? Look within them for the air tubes,--fine branching black lines. 6. If possible, without injury to the specimen, examine the larva's mouth. Try to discover how it is used and how it is protected when not in use. _Suggested drawings._ a. The entire larva, Ã 4. b. A gill, as seen through the microscope. c. The feeding apparatus, Ã 10.

What proportion of them have wings? What is the usual method of locomotion? 3. Examining a single winged specimen, how many wings do you find? How do they fold? What is the character of the wings? 4. What is the food of the plant lice? How is the food obtained? (With a hand lens identify the piercing organ.) On what parts of the plants are they found? Does the plant show any indication of being harmed by the lice? If so, how? 5. Make a count of the plant lice upon a portion of a plant and estimate the whole number upon a plant. Why are plant lice a very serious pest? 6. If any plant lice have ants associated with them, study the behavior of the ants in this curious relationship. What advantages result from this relationship of ant and aphis to either or both insects? Scale Bugs _Materials._ Twigs of trees, leaves, fruit, ferns, etc., infested with these bugs. If possible, have samples of San JosÃ© scales, maple scales, and oyster scales. _Observations._ 1. What is the general size and appearance of the various scale bugs in your collection? How do they differ in form and size and color? 2. Remove a scale and study it carefully with a lens. What is under the scale? Of what is the scale composed? What do you discover about these bugs to indicate that they are really insects? 3. What can be said about the number of scale bugs? Why are they difficult to exterminate? How can they be distributed from one place to another, as from orchard to orchard, since only the males have wings? _Drawings suggested._ a. A single aphis as seen with hand lens. b. Various scale bugs as seen with a hand lens. c. Twigs showing the distribution and numbers of scale bugs. WATER BUGS AND BEETLES Water Bugs _Materials._ Water bugs and beetles of several species in small aquaria covered with a wire net. _Observations._ 1. With what legs does the bug swim?

Remove the bug from the water for a moment to test other methods of locomotion, as jumping, crawling, flying. What do you discover? 3. Watch the bug as it gets a fresh supply of air, and describe the process. Where is the air stored for use when under water? Does the bug sink or rise when it stops swimming? Why? 4. Identify the bug's mouth parts. What is their appearance and probable manner of use? How are the forelegs fitted for grasping food? 5. What is the shape of the body? What is the position of the wings? Do the two cover (fore) wings meet in a straight line or do they cross at their tips? Are they smooth throughout and sheath-like, or are they thick at the base and thin at the tips? _Summary._ Summarize your study of the bug by enumerating the various ways the bug is adapted for life in the water. Water Beetles Use the same questions for the study of water beetles as for water bugs. In addition answer the following:-- 1. Identify the eyes of the whirligig beetle and note their peculiar construction. How can you explain this peculiar form of the eyes on the basis of use?

CHAPTER II STUDIES OF INSECTS _The effect of great numbers upon the structure and habits of animals. The use of keys in finding the names of animals._ 1. FIELD STUDIES _Materials._ 1. _Boxes_ for carrying insects. 2. A _net_. This may be homemade, using mosquito netting or fish net and a stout wire. If it is to be used for a dragnet for water insects, the wire must be stout and the netting strong. Make the net twice as long as wide. 3. A _cyanide jar_ for killing insects. 4. A few _paper triangles_ for carrying butterflies. 5. A _notebook_. _Note._--Your instructor will give directions for obtaining the material called for in 3, 4, and 5. _Directions._ Look carefully and quietly in the various situations noted below. Do not be in a hurry. Weedy meadows or vacant lots and neglected roadsides are good places for your first trips. Note concerning each insect found: (a) its name or something by which to identify it, (b) where you found it, (c) what it was doing, (d) its probable food. Record these observations in your notebook. Make a special study of such insects as your instructor may designate. Where to look for Various Insects _Grasshoppers, locusts, katydids._ Look along roadsides, waste places, gardens, especially weedy ones, weedy lots, and grassy meadows and pastures. _Crickets._ Under old boards, along the edges of board or stone walks, along fences. _Beetles._ Same locations as for crickets, and also on flowering plants, under loose bark of trees and stumps, in rotten logs, etc. For _water beetles_ drag edges of ponds and streams. _Dragon flies._ Along water-courses, ponds, and swamps. Drag ponds and ditches for larvÃ¦. _Bees._ On flowering plants, especially on large patches of wild asters, golden-rods, and thistles. _Wasps._ Sandy stretches,--especially along the water,--among flowering plants, under the eaves and roofs of outbuildings. Nests may be found in these latter places. _Butterflies and moths._ In fields where there are many flowering plants; look carefully on the leaves of plants for caterpillars, and for eggs. Also look very carefully on the under side of leaves, on twigs, and on the bark of trees for chrysalids of butterflies and cocoons of moths. _Bugs._ In same locations as for bees and grasshoppers and water beetles. Also on fruit. _Aphids._ On the fresh growing tops of plants. _Tree hoppers._ On trees and shrubs. Hold your net on the under side of branches and shake the branch vigorously. _Flies._ Around decaying substances, as garbage, fruit, etc.; on flowering plants. _Ants._ Sandy waste places, decayed logs, along walks, often in kitchens. _Note._--At night many kinds of insects fly around electric lights or into open windows, attracted by the light and may easily be collected. Form for Field Trip Report The notes taken on a field trip may be conveniently tabulated for permanent record in the form indicated below:-- FIELD TRIP REPORT Date________ Time________ Locality________ Pupil's Name________ ---------------------------------------------------------------- Name of Insect | Where Found | What it was Doing | Probable Food ---------------+-------------+-------------------+-------------- | | | | | | In case the name of the insect is not known to you, use a number and some designation as to color or other mark by which it may be known until you have leisure to look up its name by means of keys or books on insects. Special Field Studies The questions below may be used for a more careful field study of any insect. 1. Just where was the insect found? 2. Note carefully what the insects are doing before they are disturbed by your presence. What did the insects do when you disturbed them? If you think this related to securing safety, explain what leads you to think so. 3. What senses do you conclude are well developed? Reason for your conclusion. 4. Has the insect a home? If so, what is its character? 5. What is the color? What is the relation between the color of the insect and its surroundings? 6. Is the insect solitary in its habits or associated with others of the same species? If in association with others, note the numbers, and what they are doing. 7. What modes of locomotion do you observe in this insect? Which is the most common? If it flies or jumps, note the distance. 8. If you find the young, note whether they differ from the adult in general appearance, and if so, in what ways they differ. Do they differ in food? 9. What other insects do you find in the same habitat? 2.

A STUDY OF THE CELL AND OF PROTOZOA _To show what Single Cells can Do_ _Materials._ Some single cells of plant or animal tissue, stained to show structure. Slides of a one-celled animal, stained. Living one-celled animals. _Definitions._ _Cell_, the smallest living unit. _Protoplasm_, the living material composing the cell. _Nucleus_, a dense bit of protoplasm, usually near the center of the cell, often staining dark. _Cytoplasm_, the less dense protoplasm outside of the nucleus, usually taking a lighter stain. _Nucleolus_, _paranucleus_ or _micronucleus_, a very small, dense, dark-staining body, either within the nucleus (nucleolus) or near it (paranucleus or micronucleus) _Cell wall_, the lifeless membrane surrounding many cells, secreted by the protoplasm. _Food balls_, bits of food inside the cells of many one-celled animals, usually showing through the walls. _Food vacuole_, a small drop of water containing digestive material and a food ball. _Contracting_ or _pulsating vacuoles_, small, clear spots in the cell, filled with water. In the living cell these disappear at intervals and then appear again. _Oral groove_, a funnel-shaped groove in one side of some one-celled animals, conducting food to the mouth. In paramecium it often shows as an oblique line when the animal rolls. _Gullet_, the inner end of the oral groove. _Cilia_, numerous minute, vibrating, protoplasmic hairs on the surface of many cells. _Respiration_, the passage of oxygen into the tissues of a living organism and of carbon dioxide out of them. These gases can pass through any thin, moist, organic membrane. When such a membrane separates two fluids which differ in the amount of oxygen they contain, oxygen passes to the fluid containing the smaller amount.[2] The same is true of carbon dioxide. Respiration is believed to occur in all living organisms. [2] This passage of fluids through membranes is known as _osmosis_. _Digestion_, the process of making food materials soluble, so that they can pass through membranes and be used to build up protoplasm. A few forms of cells are able to take in solid food and digest it in their protoplasm, but most cells can admit only fluid food. _Fission_, a method of reproduction used in all cells, by which a cell divides itself into two, usually through the center. In some one-celled animals this may be preceded by _conjugation_, when two animals unite temporarily and exchange nuclear substance; or in some forms two cells may fuse and the resulting cell may divide. _Budding_ is a form of fission in which a small projection is formed on the parent cell and then cut off, making a new individual. _Protozoa_ (first animals), animals of one cell, existing alone or in loose colonies. _Observations._ 1. Examine a single cell, stained to show structure. Identify the nucleus, cytoplasm, and, if present, the nucleolus or the micronucleus, and the cell wall. Draw to show the form of the cell and the details of its structure. Label all details. 2. Examine some stained paramecia. Select a typical one and identify in it nucleus, micronucleus, cytoplasm, and cell wall or cell membrane. You may also be able to see vacuoles, looking like holes in the stained protoplasm. Give reasons for considering this animal to be a single cell. Draw one, to show its cellular structure. Label all details. 3. Clean a slide and cover glass, place a drop of water containing living paramecia on the slide, cover it, and examine. What structures do you see which you saw in the stained paramecia? What structures do not show? Identify any new structures you may observe. Identify also the leading end and the side containing the oral groove. 4. Describe the shape of the animal. What is the actual length of the animal? 5. After watching the animal for some time, describe the path followed by a given specimen as it crosses the field of the microscope. What reason can you see, if any, why this paramecium is moving? What external factors, if any, seem to determine the path it follows? 6. How rapidly do paramecia really move? What structures do they use in locomotion? How do they manage to move in one direction, instead of alternately backward and forward? How do they manage to move in a straight line, though their bodies are not symmetrical? 7. What is the food of the paramecia? How do they find it? Find a specimen at rest and watch the oral groove. Suggest a method by which food may be collected into it. If possible, note the process of swallowing, and the resulting food ball. _Note._--If powdered carmine be placed in the water with some paramecia, it can be seen in the food balls a half hour or so later. 8. Where are the food balls located? Watch them in an individual until you notice their motion. Where are the larger food balls? the smaller ones? Assuming them to have been of approximately equal sizes when they were taken in, how can you account for differences now? 9. Where are the contracting vacuoles? How many are there? How often does one contract? What is their function? 10. As you have been studying paramecia, to what external influences (as contact, heat, light, etc.) have you seen them respond? How do they show it when they do respond? Is such a response an advantage to them or not? What would be the result if they were not able to detect changes in their surroundings? 11. Where does respiration occur in paramecia? Where do they obtain their supply of oxygen? 12. Among the paramecia you are studying you usually find at least one in the process of fission. Watch it until the halves separate, if you can. Compare the halves. Do they rank as parent and offspring? If so, which is which? If not, which are they, parent or offspring? 13. If you happen to find a pair conjugating, notice the process, as far as you can, in the living animals. _Suggested drawings._ a. A drawing to show all the details seen in the living paramecium. b. A diagram to show the path followed by a paramecium to get around some obstacle. c. Drawings to show that paramecia are constant in shape and yet flexible. d. A drawing to show at least one stage in fission. This may be from a permanent preparation. e. A drawing to show paramecia conjugating. This also may be from a permanent preparation. f. Instead of all these separate drawings they may be combined into one. Represent the field of the microscope, and in it draw all necessary figures, to show the facts called for in the first five drawings and any other facts you have observed about living protozoa. Make the whole drawing to scale. Summary of Important Points in the Study of Paramecia 1. Look back over your study of paramecia and list the different kinds of work you saw paramecia doing; also the kinds of work you infer they can do. What organs have they to use? When there is no organ to do a given thing, _e.g._ to digest food, how is the work done? 2. What conditions are favorable to paramecia? Why are they so numerous under favorable conditions? 3. What would you call a successful animal? Are paramecia successful? Give reasons why they are or are not. Comparative Study of Protozoa To enlarge your idea of what a cell can do, spend as much more time on the one-celled animals as your course will permit. Any stagnant water may furnish several kinds. By means of reference books, identify as many as you can. In each case notice:-- 1. Its size, shape and general appearance, comparing and contrasting it with paramecium. 2. Its usual surroundings, _i.e._ the conditions it has to meet. 3. The means it has of finding out facts about its surroundings. 4. The means it has of adjusting itself to its surroundings. For example, is it stationary? If so, what does it do when conditions change? Is it locomotory? If so, how effective is its locomotion? 5. What is its food? How does it find food? 6. Can it do as many kinds of work as paramecium can? Can it do any that paramecium cannot do? If so, what? Review and Library Questions on Protozoa 1. What are the characteristics which distinguish protozoa from other animals? 2. What are the classes of protozoa? Characteristics of each class? 3. What is digestion?

A STUDY OF SPONGES _To show how cells loosely associated may work together_. _Materials._ The simplest of the many-celled animals are the sponges, which, with one exception, are salt-water forms. That one, the spongilla, is not easily found and is very difficult to maintain in the laboratory. For these reasons the material for this study is very meager, except at the seashore, and much of the work must be done from diagrams and reference books. Small simple preserved sponges and complex toilet sponge skeletons will also be used. _Definitions._ _Body wall_, the outer wall in bodies of the many-celled animals. _Central cavity_, the cavity surrounded by the body wall in the simpler many-celled animals, as in the sponges. _Canals_, channels through the body walls of sponges. _Inhalent pores_, the outer ends of the canals. _Ostia_, the inner ends of the canals. _Osculum_, the large opening of the central cavity, at the distal end of the sponge. _Spicules_, tiny needles of mineral substance found in the walls of many sponges. _Fibers_, flexible threads of horny material found in the walls of many sponges. _Endoderm cells_, cells lining the canals. They have cilia or flagella (projections larger than cilia). _Ectoderm cells_, cells covering the outside of sponges and some other animals. In sponges it is believed that endoderm and ectoderm cells are able to exchange positions and functions. _Mesoglea_, a jelly-like layer between the endoderm and ectoderm layers. In the sponges this contains many wandering cells, probably from the other layers. _Porifera_ (pore bearers), animals with many more or less independent cells, supported by solid skeletal parts and penetrated by a system of canals which open on the surface as pores. _Directions._ Study a simple sponge to see the shape, size, and point of attachment. Identify the osculum. In a diagram of a long section of a simple sponge identify the central cavity, body walls, canals, inhalent pores, ostia, and osculum. In a simple sponge cut like the diagram identify the same structures. Do the same for the toilet sponge. Study a diagram of a portion of the body wall, considerably enlarged. Identify the endoderm and ectoderm cells, the spicules or fibers, and, among the spicules or fibers, irregular amoeboid cells, sometimes called mesoderm cells. Examine a fragment or section of each kind of sponge under the microscope. Notice the arrangement, shape, and length of the spicules and of the fibers. Test both kinds of sponges by dropping a bit of each into weak acid, and noting the results. Also burn a bit of each and notice the odor. _Questions._ 1. What is the shape of a simple sponge? What enables a mass of cells to retain such a definite shape? 2. What seems to be the composition of the skeletons? Why is one type of skeleton rigid and the other elastic? 3. Since sponges are attached for most of their lives to stationary objects, suggest means for obtaining food and oxygen, and for getting rid of waste matter. 4. Although individual cells are sensitive, a sponge as a whole is not. What connection has this fact with the fact that sponges are stationary? 5. Compare simple and complex sponges. _Suggested drawings._ a. A view of a simple sponge. Label everything shown. b. A diagram of a simple sponge split in halves. Show by arrows the path followed by the water as it passes through the sponge. c. A few spicules. d. A few fibers. Summary of Important Points in the Study of Sponges 1. What are two functions of the spicules or fibers? 2. What are at least two of the functions of the endoderm cells? 3. What can you suggest as functions for the ectoderm cells? 4. In what cases do cells show ""team work"" in accomplishing an object? 5. What degree of specialization is indicated by the fact that the cells may exchange positions and functions? 6. What work can any single cell of a sponge do? Compare the work done by such a cell with that done by a paramecium. 7. What work can a whole sponge do? Compare that with the work done by a paramecium.

Living hydras in small aquaria, _i.e._ tumblers, test tubes, watch glasses, etc., with pieces of water weed and if possible some of the microscopic animals found in water where hydras are abundant. If kept cool, hydras may live several days in such aquaria. Permanent slides of hydras; some whole, some in sections, and some showing the organs of reproduction. _Definitions._ _Proximal end_, the end by which an animal is attached to an object. _Distal end_, the end opposite the proximal end. _Tentacles_, slender projections around the distal end. _Mouth_, the opening through the distal end, into the central cavity. _Bud_, a small hydra or other coelenterate growing out from the wall of the parent. _Mesoglea_, a thin, gluey partition, without wandering cells, between the ectoderm and the endoderm. _Nettle cells_, very small cells, chiefly in the tentacles, easily identified in permanent preparations as clear cells with small hairs projecting from them. See text-books for details of their structure. _Spermary_, the region or organ where the sperm cells are formed. _Ovary_, the region or organ where the egg cells are formed. _Coelenterates_ (hollow bowels), sac-shaped animals, the digestive tract having only one opening; the body wall is of two layers. _Directions._ Take a small aquarium to your table, set it down carefully and leave it undisturbed. Identify a hydra and watch it for some time. _Observations on the living animals._ 1. Describe the size and shape of a hydra when expanded. Disturb it slightly by shaking the aquarium a little, and describe its shape when contracted. Notice also the flexibility of the body. What do you infer concerning the hydra's possession of a skeleton? What advantage can it be to have a body so flexible? 2. How many tentacles has the hydra that you are studying?

Suggest all the methods you think it may be able to use. What is your opinion of the hydra's power of locomotion? Of what use is it in getting food; in escaping enemies; in following the fluctuations of the water supply? If you had to class the hydra as either one, would you call it a stationary or a locomotory animal? 8. Study budding hydras. Compare the bud with the parent hydra as to size, form and number and size of tentacles. Notice whether the bud moves independently or only with the parent. When does it separate from the parent? 9. In hydras collected late in the fall you may see another method of reproduction. If such material is at hand, notice small swellings near the proximal end and others near the tentacles. Eggs are produced in the lower one, the ovary, and sperm cells in the upper one, the spermary. Refer to your text-book for further details. _Details of structure._ 1. Using an entire mounted specimen and a section of hydra, identify the body wall and the central cavity. What is the extent of the central cavity? (Examine both the body and the tentacles.) Where does it open to the outside? What do you think is its use? 2. In the body wall, identify the endodermal and ectodermal layers of cells, separated by the mesoglea, which is usually stained more deeply. Study these cell layers carefully. What work ought each to do? What can you discover in its structure which would fit each layer to do its work? 3. In the tentacles, identify the nettle cells. Where are they? How are they arranged?

Hydras to show reproduction in one or both ways. e. A section of hydra, showing details. Comparative Study of Coelenterates _Materials._ Various coelenterates, such as hydroids, hydro-medusÃ¦, jellyfishes, sea anemones, corals, sea fans, etc. Since nearly all the coelenterates except hydras are marine forms, these will usually have to be dead specimens, preserved in formalin or alcohol, or put up as permanent preparations for the microscope. _Definitions._ _Colony_, as used in this group, a number of individuals descended by budding from an original one, and remaining connected. _Polyp_, an individual coelenterate; one of the individuals in a colony. _Observations._ 1. How large is an individual specimen in the form you are studying? If the form is colonial, how large is the colony or portion of a colony you are studying? Estimate the number of individuals in it. Is the colony free-swimming or attached? If attached, to what is it usually fastened? 2.

A STUDY OF WORMS _To show cells associated even more closely than in coelenterates, forming tissues and systems of organs._ #A STUDY OF EARTHWORMS# The Living Earthworm _Materials._ Living earthworms, some of which are left undisturbed from day to day, in damp earth with leaves of various plants scattered upon it. _Definitions._ _Anterior end_, the head end, usually the leading end. _Posterior end_, the end opposite the anterior end. _Ventral surface_, the lower surface, usually the one which contains the mouth. _Dorsal surface_, the one opposite the ventral surface. _Somites_, the rings or segments of which some animal bodies are composed. _Bilateral symmetry_, the symmetry usually shown by animals which have differentiated dorsal and ventral surfaces, and right and left sides. Animals which do not have such differentiated surfaces are usually _radially symmetrical_, but sometimes asymmetrical (without symmetry). _Girdle_, the somewhat transparent band frequently found near the anterior end of an earthworm. _Anal opening_, the posterior opening of the food canal. _SetÃ¦_ (singular form, _seta_), small bristles or stiff hairs. In the earthworm these are set in the body wall at definite intervals, and aid in locomotion. _Cuticle_, in the earthworm a delicate, shining cover over the body. _Egg capsules_, small, light-colored, spindle-shaped sacks, about the size and somewhat the shape of a grain of wheat, containing the eggs or young of earthworms. _Directions._ Take a living earthworm to your table and keep it damp by placing it in a wet tray or upon moist paper. Identify the anterior and posterior ends, the dorsal and ventral surfaces, and the right and left sides. Identify also the somites and the girdle, the mouth with its projecting lip, and the anal opening. _Observations._ 1. Watch a living worm for some time. Does it seem to have a definite object in its moving? If so, what is it? Upon what sense or senses does it seem to depend for guidance? Which end usually leads? Why? 2. Over what sort of surface does it move most easily? Why? Watch it closely for some time and discover how it is able to move from place to place. (_Suggestion._ What is the function of the setÃ¦ in this process? How can you explain the alternate contraction and expansion of parts?) 3. From time to time, for perhaps a week, examine the leaves which were scattered where the worms could reach them. Have the worms moved them about at all? If so, where are the leaves left? Have any been eaten, in part or entirely? If so, is there any evidence of selection, either as to the kind of leaf or the portion of leaf eaten? If earthworms select food, what senses would be useful for the purpose? Have you any evidence that earthworms possess such senses? 4. Looking through the dorsal wall, notice the meandering red line, seen more easily in some regions than in others. This is the dorsal blood vessel. How long is it? Where is it wider? Where narrower? Notice its pulsations. How many times per minute does it pulsate? In which direction is the blood forced? Is there a corresponding ventral blood vessel? Place a small worm between two pieces of glass, so that you may see through it more easily, and identify the blood vessels encircling the digestive canal, near the anterior end. These are the so-called ""hearts"" of the earthworm. If possible, decide in which direction the blood flows through them. 5. The food canal, or alimentary canal, lies underneath the dorsal blood vessel, and is usually easily seen, especially if it is full of food. Notice it when the worm is fully stretched and again when it is contracted. How long is the canal? Why does it wrinkle when the worm contracts? Where does it open to the outside? Why does it need to? 6. Where do you infer respiration must take place in this animal? Why do you think so? What fits this surface for such a purpose? Why does an earthworm seem so uncomfortable when it is too dry? 7. Where do earthworms live? What conditions are necessary in their habitat? 8. When do earthworms usually leave their burrows? Why at that particular time rather than at another? Why does ""the early bird catch the worm""? 9. What enemies do earthworms have? How are they protected against these enemies? 10. If you have found egg capsules when collecting worms, describe them. External Morphology of Earthworms _Materials._ Preserved earthworms, the larger the better. _Observations._ 1.

Why? 4. How many somites are there from the anterior end to the girdle? How many under the girdle? How many from the girdle to the posterior end? 5. Where are the setÃ¦ located in a somite? How are they distributed over the body? _Suggested drawings._ a. An earthworm, dorsal aspect. b. An earthworm, ventral aspect. c. An outline diagram of a cross section, to show the location of the setÃ¦, the blood vessels and the alimentary canal. Internal Morphology or Anatomy _Materials._ (1) Preserved earthworms, as large as you can obtain. (2) Cross sections of earthworms. (3) Longitudinal sections of earthworms. _Definitions._ _Body cavity_, the space between the body wall and the alimentary canal. _Septa_ (singular, _septum_), the thin walls between somites, seen when the worm is opened. _Pharynx_, the hard-walled, rather bulbous, anterior portion of the alimentary canal. _Esophagus_, the portion of the alimentary canal extending back from the pharynx with thinner walls and smaller diameter. _Crop_, the short, wide portion of the canal back of the esophagus. _Gizzard_, the hard-walled, short region, just back of the crop. _Stomach-intestine_, the portion of the canal reaching from the gizzard to the anus. _Ventral nerve cord_, a light-colored thread lying against the inner surface of the ventral body wall. _Nerve ganglia_ (singular, _ganglion_), slight swellings on the ventral nerve cord. _Nerve ring_ or _collar_, a pair of nerves extending from the ventral nerve cord around the pharynx to a pair of ganglia (often called the ""brain"") in the dorsal region of the anterior end. _Kidney tubes_ or _nephridia_, the excretory organs of the earthworm, occurring as slender, paired tubes in nearly every somite. _Directions._ Select a large worm and cut carefully through the body wall along one side, midway between the dorsal and ventral surfaces, from the anterior end to the posterior. Lay the worm on any convenient fairly soft surface (a piece of pine, cork, peat, paraffin), preferably under water, and pin out the walls so that you can see into the interior. Identify the structures defined above, as well as the dorsal and ventral blood vessels and the ""hearts."" The nephridia are not easily distinguished, though they are very numerous. They are long, slender, coiled tubes, two in each somite, lying in the body cavity, one on each side of the alimentary canal. If possible, identify them. Notice that most of the internal organs are free from the body wall, lying free in the body cavity. _Questions._ 1. What is the extent of the body cavity, anteriorly and posteriorly? What is its shape? 2. What, in general, is the shape of the food canal? How many external openings has it? 3. Into what regions is the food canal differentiated? Suggest one advantage of having these specialized regions. 4. How is the alimentary canal of the worm kept away from the body walls? Why have it thus supported? 5. What is a septum? How many septa are there? What vessels and tubes pass through a septum? 6. Locate the nerve cord. How long is it? How frequently do the ganglia occur on it? Which end of the living worm is the more sensitive. Suggest the connection between this fact and the location of ganglia. _Suggested drawings._ a. Earthworm, showing structures mentioned in this study. Details of Structure--Microscopic Anatomy _Materials._ Sections of earthworms, preferably both cross sections and dorso-ventral, longitudinal ones. _Directions._ In a section under a simple lens, identify the dorsal and ventral surfaces, the body wall, the body cavity, the alimentary canal, and, if possible, the dorsal and ventral blood vessels and the ventral nerve cord. Under a microscope identify the same structures. Notice that the body wall consists of three layers of cells: an outer single layer, the _epidermis_; a middle layer, the _circular muscles_; and an inner one, the _longitudinal muscles_. The nephridia show as loosely scattered fragments in the body cavity, at the right and left of the alimentary canal. If you happen to have a section which shows one or more setÃ¦, identify the muscles which operate it, and the group of glandular cells at its inner end, which are known as _setigerous_ (from _seta_) cells. _Questions._ 1. Describe the epidermal cells. What is their probable function? Among them notice larger cells, clear and rounded. These are the _mucous_ (slime) cells. What is the use of mucus to the worm? 2. Describe the muscle cells. In which direction do the muscle fibers extend? What is their function? Which layer of muscle cells is thicker, the circular or the longitudinal? Why should it be? 3. Notice the cells in the walls of the alimentary canal. What layers do you find? How are they arranged? 4. If the section you are studying is a cross section from the region back of the gizzard, the alimentary canal will look horseshoe shaped, indented from the dorsal surface. What is the effect of this indentation upon the amount of surface in the alimentary canal? 5. Study the cells of the nerve cord. How do they compare in size and shape with the muscle cells? _Suggested drawings._ a. A diagram of a cross section, showing the relation of the organs. b. A diagram of a longitudinal section, at least through the body wall, to show the arrangement of muscle fibers. c. A drawing of a portion of the body wall, to show details.

A STUDY OF CRAYFISHES _Materials._ Crayfishes, living and preserved. Some of the living crayfishes should be established in conditions as natural as possible _i.e._ in an inch or so of fresh water, with rocks, weeds, etc., and left undisturbed. Small crayfishes are desirable to show locomotion in water. Living Crayfishes _Directions and observations._ 1. Observe living crayfishes in their usual habitat or in a large aquarium, without disturbing them, and see where they stay when they are free to choose. Notice their position. What senses are on guard? What is the color of the head and claws? How may this color aid the animal in getting food or in escaping enemies? Why is the color of the posterior region less important than the color of the anterior? 2. Offer them bits of meat. If one takes food, notice the appendages it uses. How does it discover the food? With what appendages does it grasp the food? How is the food conveyed to the mouth? With what senses, if any, does the animal test the food as it eats it? 3. If the crayfishes are in plenty of water and you startle them in any way, some of them may swim. Watch for such an occurrence and notice it carefully. How is swimming accomplished? Which end leads in swimming? How far does the animal swim at a stroke? How long does it continue to swim? Where does it go? Does it see where it is going? For what purpose would this method of locomotion be useful? 4. Place a living crayfish in a tray with water to cover it, and take it to your table. Watch the crayfish as it walks about in the water, then take it out and let it walk out of water. Compare the two processes. What causes the differences? 5. How many appendages are used in walking? What order, if any, is there in moving the legs? Which method, walking or swimming, does it use in going to some particular spot, _e.g._ in going to find food or cover? Why? 6.

Morphology of a Crayfish _Definitions._ _Cephalo-thorax_, the anterior half of the body, divided into the head and the thorax. _Cervical groove_, the groove dividing the head from the thorax. _Abdomen_, the posterior half of the body, consisting of a number of somites. _Note._--The central part of the tail fin is usually included as a somite. _Carapace_, the continuous shell-like portion of the exoskeleton covering the cephalo-thorax. _Rostrum_, the sharp projection of the carapace at the anterior end. _Gill chamber_, a pocket on each side of the thorax, covered by a flap of the carapace. _Appendages_, paired structures attached to the body. They are named as follows:-- _Eyestalks._ (These are not classed as appendages by all students.) _Antennules_, the small feelers. _AntennÃ¦_, the large feelers. _Mandibles_, the jaws, one on each side of the mouth. _MaxillÃ¦_, the two pairs of small mouth parts just back of the mandibles. _Maxillipeds_, the three pairs of appendages between the maxillÃ¦ and the large claws. _Chelipeds_, the large claws or pinchers. _Walking legs_, the four pairs of appendages back of the chelipeds. _Swimmerets_, the appendages on the abdomen. _Openings_, five on the ventral surface, as follows:-- The openings from the excretory organs, through small white cones on the bases of the antennÃ¦. The mouth, farther back, between the maxillipeds. The anal opening, in the last segment of the abdomen. The opening from the reproductive gland, toward the posterior part of the thorax. _Observations._ 1. How large is your specimen? How does it compare in size with other crayfishes in the laboratory? 2. Describe the shape of the body, contrasting the anterior end with the posterior, and the dorsal surface with the ventral. 3. Study the amount of motion permitted in different parts of the body. What prevents motion? What permits it? Where is the body most flexible? Why? Where is it most rigid? Why? 4. How much of the surface is covered with exoskeleton? What arrangement is there to permit the animal to feel contact? How can the animal grow with such an exoskeleton? 5. Place a dead crayfish in dilute acid for a few hours. What is the result? What has the acid done? Explain the fact that crayfishes are often found alive and well with a soft shell? 6. Compare the cephalo-thorax with the abdomen as to size, shape, and flexibility. 7. How many somites are there in the abdomen? Which way does it bend? Study the somite shells on every side and then state what there is in their construction which determines the direction and amount of their motion. How are the somite shells arranged to protect the body during bending? How is the ventral surface of the abdomen protected? 8. Where are the appendages attached? Study a walking leg and describe its general construction, the number and kind of joints, the direction of motion in each joint, and the range of motion for the whole leg. Study an antenna in the same way. What methods are used in the crayfish to secure a wide range of motion? To secure flexibility? 9. Carefully split a crayfish into right and left halves. To do this, first cut through the ventral exoskeleton from end to end with scissors, then with a sharp knife or razor cut through to the dorsal exoskeleton and cut that with the scissors.

They are often called shellfish as most of the forms have a shell. _Lamellibranchiata_ or _Pelecypoda_, names given to the class of Mollusca to which the clam belongs. The former term refers to the broad, flap-like gills and the latter to the hatchet-like foot. _Valve_, one of two parts of the clamshell. _Hinge ligament_, the elastic structure which fastens the valves together at the dorsal margin. _Umbones_, a pair of elevations near the anterior end of the shell. _Lines of growth_, concentric lines around the umbones. _Siphons_, two openings at the posterior end of the clam, the upper opening is the _excurrent_ opening and the lower the _incurrent_. In the salt water clam the siphons form a long tube, usually called the ""neck."" _Hinge teeth_, projections near the dorsal margin on the inner surface of the shell. The anterior irregular structure is the _cardinal_ and the more posterior blade-like structure is the _lateral_ tooth. _Muscle scars_, scar-like markings on the inner surface of the shell indicating the point where muscles were attached. The large scar just in front of the cardinal tooth is the _anterior adductor muscle scar_, and the one just back of the lateral tooth is the _posterior adductor muscle scar_. _Pallial line_, a line connecting the two muscle scars. _Mantle_, folds of skin covering the body of the clam and lying close to the inner surface of the valves. _Foot_, a hatchet-shaped structure extending from the ventral edge of the body. _Gills_, broad flap-like structures for respiration, situated each side of the body in the mantle cavity. They consist of a double fold of membrane through which run many perforations lined with cilia. The waving of these cilia cause the current of water needed for respiration. _Palps_, small flap-like structures near the anterior end of the clam. They surround the mouth. On their surface are cilia which cause currents of water toward the mouth. _Adductor muscles_, large muscles extending from valve to valve. _Observations._ Identify anterior and posterior ends, dorsal and ventral surfaces, right and left sides. 1. Why may a clam be called a bivalve? 2. What is the position of the clam in the mud? What is the position of the foot if the clam is undisturbed?

Describe what you see. 6. Drop some powdered chalk or carmine in the water just above the siphon, watch the siphons for several minutes, and note what happens. What do you conclude to be the use of the siphons? Recalling what took place in sponges, what would you suggest as the probable cause of these currents? What does the clam thus probably obtain? How do the two siphons differ? Why? 7. Place a clam in water sufficient to cover it and heat slowly to about 40 degrees Centigrade, until the valves open slightly. Remove and proceed as follows: Raise one valve, separate the mantle from it, and then cut through the two large firm structures (adductor muscles) found at each end. What does the valve do when the muscles are cut? What is the cause of this? State your theory as to how a clam opens and closes its shell. 8. Note the texture of the mantle. How many lobes has it? What is their extent? How are the lobes related to the valves? 9. Remove or lift up one mantle lobe. Identify the soft body, the foot, the gills, the palps, and the mouth. Which of these structures are arranged in pairs? 10. Determine the structure and composition of the shell as follows:-- a. Break a thick clamshell and examine the broken edge.

When the opposite is true, the body is said to be _flattened_. _Median fins_, the unpaired fins situated on the median line, dorsal and ventral, including the tail or _caudal_ fin, the _dorsal_ fin, and the _anal_ fin. _Paired fins_, fins occurring in pairs of which the more anterior are the _pectoral_ fins and the posterior are the _pelvic_ fins. _Fin rays_, the framework or skeleton of the fins over which membrane is stretched to form the fins. Fin rays are of two kinds: those composed of _bone_ and those composed of _cartilage_. _Lateral line_, a sense organ extending along each side of the fish in a line indicated by tubes or perforations in the scales. _Gills_, respiratory organs adapted for taking oxygen from the water. _Operculum_, the flaps covering the gills on each side of the head. _Pigment_, a substance which gives color to an object. _Observations._ _Locomotion._ 1. Watch the fishes in the large aquarium and determine which fins are most used and how they are used (a) in swimming forward, (b) in swimming upward and downward, (c) in maintaining balance, (d) in remaining at rest, and (e) in guiding the movements of the fish. 2. What advantages are there to the fish (a) in the power to open and close the dorsal and anal fins, (b) in having no neck, and (c) in having a compressed form? 3. Enumerate the various ways by which the body of the fish is adapted to rapid movement through the water. _Feeding._ 4. What is the food of the fishes you are studying? Feed them and watch them eat. Why is the upper jaw often called a ""lip""? What is the shape and size of the mouth when opened in feeding? Does the fish chew its food? Describe in detail the fishes' method of feeding. _Respiration._ 5. Identify the opercula and the gill openings. Watch the movements of the opercula and mouth, and determine what movements are concerned in breathing and their order. Describe in detail the circulation of water used in breathing and how it is caused. _Sense Organs._ 6. Identify the eyes, nostrils, and lateral line. How many nostrils are there and where located? What is the position and extent of the lateral line? 7. Describe the location of the eyes. What is the shape of the outer surface of the eyes? Why this shape? Can the eyes be moved, _i.e._ can they be rotated, rolled, or retracted? From what direction might an enemy approach without being seen? How would such an enemy be detected? _Protection._ 8. With what protective structures is the body covered? Do they hinder the movements of the fish? What are the advantages of the scale covering of fishes over the shell covering of grasshoppers or crayfishes? 9. In what other ways are the fishes you are studying protected against enemies? Since you cannot account for the red color of goldfishes on the basis of use to the fish, then how do you account for this bright color? _The Body._ 10. What is the symmetry of the fish? Into what regions is the body divided? _Summary of the study of the living fish._ Enumerate in one column the different adaptations which fit the fish for life in water and in a second column state the special purpose of each adaption. The External Structure of the Fish _Materials._ Freshly killed or preserved fish in dishes or shallow pans with enough water to prevent drying. Simple or compound microscopes, forceps, and a bristle. _Directions._ Examine the fins and identify the membrane and the supporting rods, or _rays_, of bone or cartilage. Notice how the ends of the cartilaginous rays keep the membrane from tearing. Investigate the scales as to their arrangement, number, and size. Remove a small patch of scales along the lateral line to find how they are attached, where the fish's color is situated, and how access to the sensory organs of the line is permitted. Examine a scale under the microscope. Observe the eyes and identify the parts similar to those of the human eye: lid, lash, tear-duct, cornea, iris, and pupil. In front of and between the eyes, find the nostrils. By means of a bristle determine whether these are connected and whether they do or do not open into the mouth or the throat. _Questions._ 1. Make a list of the fins, classifying them according to their structure. 2. Bearing in mind the differences in structure and consequent action,--what can you say regarding the adaptation of the several fins for protection? for rigidity or flexibility in locomotion? 3. State how much of the body is covered with scales, and where the largest and the smallest ones are found. 4. How are the scales arranged with reference to each other? What benefit is derived from this in protection? in locomotion? If you have noticed any mucus or slime upon the body, state its use. 5. Do the scales or the skin bear the pigment? Give the color pattern of the kind of fish used in class. How would this be useful to the fish in its natural home? 6. Describe the structure of a scale and state how it is attached to the skin. In what way is the lateral-line scale specialized? 7. State how, when the fish is swimming, the nostrils catch odors. By means of a diagram, with arrows show the probable direction of the water current through the nose. 8. State which of the structures of your eye are present in the fish's eye, and which are missing. Could a fish weep? wink? How would a fish sleep? 9. Inasmuch as light penetrates water but a little way, so that objects can be distinguished only within about thirty feet, would the fish be nearsighted or farsighted? _Suggested drawings._ a. A side view of the entire fish, fully labeled. b. A bony rayed and a cartilaginous rayed fin. c. A scale, showing its minute structure. d. A dorsal or a lateral view of the head, showing the sense organs. The Mouth and the Gills of the Fish _Materials._ The same materials as those used in the preceding exercise may be used here. _Directions._ The mouth, its structure and its action, can be seen by pulling the upper jaw upward and forward until the mouth and the gill chambers open fully. Examine the structure and action of the jaws, the tongue, the throat, and the teeth on each jaw and on the roof of the mouth. Investigate the breathing apparatus from the throat side and from the exterior, noting the number, form, and structure of the gills, their attachment and their protection. The mouth may be kept open by a short splinter or a ball of paper. The pupil should identify the following structures:-- 1. _Gill_, an organ for breathing the air dissolved in water. 2. _Gill arch_, an arch of bone or cartilage supporting the gills. 3. _Gill filaments_, fringe-like structures attached to the gill arches, forming the gills. 4. _Gill raker_, lateral projections from the gill arches. 5. _Gill-slits_, openings between the gill arches for the passage of water. 6. _Operculum_, the flap-like covering of the gills on each side of the head. _Questions._ 1. Compared with the size of its body, how wide can the fish open its mouth? What do you infer as to the size of its ""bite""? 2. Are the jaws rigidly affixed to the skull? Why should they be so attached, or why not? 3. Of how many pieces is the upper jaw composed? the under jaw? 4. Where are the teeth? Judging from their form, size, and situation, what do you think must be their use? 5. Do you think the tongue is used to assist in mastication? in tasting? in speech? in swallowing? 6. How many gills are there, and where are they situated? How are they attached? Which one is not free from the body throughout its length? 7. What probably causes the color of the gill filaments? What is there in their number and texture which fits them for their function? 8. What is the direction of the water current through the gill chamber? Of what use are the gill rakers? 9. How are the gills protected? _Summary._ Write a complete account of how the fish eats and how it breathes. _Suggested drawings._ a. A front view of the fish's face, with the mouth fully open. b. A side view, as above. c. A ventral view of the head, with both gill-chambers wide open and the gills separated from each other. Indicate currents by arrows. d. A single gill. The Alimentary Canal and the Circulatory System of the Fish _Materials._ Small fresh fish, shallow pans or dishes of water, forceps, and scissors. _Directions._ If the instructor has not opened the fish previously, this is to be done by the student as follows: On the ventral side, insert the scissors in the vent (in front of the anal fin) and cut straight forward to a point between the opercula. Care must be exercised in opening the chamber about the heart; this lies between the gill chambers. The various organs, so far as possible, should be carefully drawn out and separated, in order that their structure may be distinguished. The pupil should identify the following parts:-- 1. _Body cavity_, the entire internal space, divided by a membrane, _false diaphragm_, into a large _abdominal cavity_ and a small chamber, _pericardial chamber_, between the gill chambers. 2. _Liver_, a large red or pink mass lying at the front end of the abdominal cavity, and divided into two unequal lobes. The _gall-bladder_, thin-walled and green, may be seen between these lobes. 3. _Alimentary canal._ a. _Mouth._ b. _Esophagus_, in the fish a very short tube. c. _Stomach_, white and muscular, beginning with a very short esophagus and ending as a blind sac. If it is much distended, open it to see what the fish may have eaten. d. _Small intestine_, thin-walled, tubular, and somewhat coiled. e. _Large intestine_, a short, thin-walled expansion at the posterior end of the small intestine; usually less than half an inch long. f. _Coeca_, from two to several small pouches attached where the small intestine leaves the stomach. 4. _Spleen_, a reddish brown _globule_ between the folds of the intestine. 5. _Swim bladder_, an elongated chamber lying against the backbone, partitioned off from the cavity below by a delicate membrane. 6. _Peritoneum_, the delicate, silvery membrane which lines the abdominal cavity and enfolds the viscera. Note its spots of pigment. 7. _Pericardial chamber_, the chamber around the heart; see Â§ 1 above. 8. _Heart._ As the fish is placed belly upward in the pan the _ventricle_ faces you, pink, conical, and muscular. Posterior to it, on the dorsal side, is the _auricle_, a membranous sac. 9. _Ventral aorta_, arising on the anterior surface of the ventricle as a white muscular ""cord"" (really a tube) which is enlarged close to the heart into a bulb, the _arterial bulb_. You should follow up this aorta until you see it divide right and left to send its branches outward into the gills, the branches being called _gill arteries_. _Questions._ 1. The fish frequently swallows its food alive. Why should the stomach be muscular? Why is it better that the intestine does not leave the stomach at the end opposite the esophagus? 2. Of what use can the coeca be? What structure of the human intestine do you recall that is at all like them in form or use? 3. How many times the length of the body is the length of the alimentary canal? Does this indicate that the fish is compelled to eat a great deal of poor food or that its food is highly nutritious, so that little need be taken? 4. Near which end of the fish's body is the heart? Is this the usual or the unusual condition among animals you know about? What advantages can you think of in this arrangement? 5. What advantages are there in having the heart in a chamber separated from the other vital organs? 6. Of how many chambers does the heart consist? Why should at least one of them be muscular? 7. How many times does the blood pass through the heart in making a complete circuit of the body? Would you call this a single or a double circulation? 8. Does the heart force the blood onward or does it draw blood into itself, _i.e._ is the heart a force pump or is it a suction pump? 9. How is circulation made complete? If the heart is a force pump, is its power sufficient to drive blood through artery, capillary, vein, and into auricle, if the capillaries can stand the pressure, or is another action concerned? If it is a suction pump, why does the blood leave the heart? _Suggested drawings._ a. The body cavity, with viscera undisturbed. b. The alimentary canal extended. c. The anterior end of the fish with the sinus held open, to show the general situation of the parts. d. The heart in its chamber, with the outgoing vessels as far as dissected. Use arrows to show direction of circulation. e. A copy of some good diagram or chart which illustrates the heart of the fish with the connecting veins and arteries.

Primitive Chordates _Materials._ An acorn-tongued worm, a lancelet, a lamprey, a shark, and a perch. If individual specimens are not available, the pupil's text-book and charts are to be used. _Observations._ _Acorn-tongued worm_: Notice the very simple form and structure of the symmetrical body, the ""proboscis,"" the collar surrounding the neck with its simple rod of cartilage, the marks of internal gills and gill slits extending some distance along the body, and the presence or absence of sense organs. The acorn-tongued worm (_Balanoglossus_) lives in the sand of the seashore and in shallow water in temperate and tropical regions. _Lancelet_: Observe the form of the body, of the fin, and of the mouth; note the presence or absence of sense organs, and find out the number of gills or gill slits. The lancelet (_Amphioxus_) is similar in habit to the acorn-tongued worm. By day it lies buried with only the mouth exposed, but at night it swims actively about. It is somewhat more confined to the tropics. _Lamprey_: Observe here also the primitive or unspecialized form of the body, of the fin, of the jawless mouth, the number of gill slits, and the sense organs. _Shark_: Examine the body, noting its form and differentiation into regions, its covering, its fins, mouth, gill slits, and sense organs. _Perch_: If you have not already studied the bony fish, the points suggested for the shark will be sufficient for this exercise. In each case, find out the condition of the skeleton. _Questions._ 1. Which of these animals seem most simple in form, and which most complex? Give a reason for your answer. 2. Give the stages which show how the fold of skin develops into separate fins. 3. How does the number of gills and gill slits change in the series? (Give definite numbers.) How may the reduction in the number of gills be compensated for in the amount of surface exposed for the exchange of gases in breathing? 4. How is protection afforded the delicate structure of the gills in the final form? 5. Give the stages in the formation of a definite, symmetrical mouth with jaws of equal size. 6. The presence of sense organs may be taken to indicate that there is an organ of control, or brain. How is the development of this organ like or unlike that of the other structures in the series? 7. For the developing brain and nervous system what protection and support is afforded in each case? The foregoing questions may be answered in tabular form by arranging the names of the animals in a line and the questions in a column. _Suggested drawings._ a. Acorn-tongued worm, Ã 1. b.

STUDIES OF AMPHIBIA# #Progress from Water-living Animals to Land-living Animals# The Living Frog or Toad _To show how an Animal may be adapted to both Land and Water Life_ _Materials._ Living frogs in small cages or aquaria; living toads; some pungent liquid, as ammonia. _Observations._ _The Body._ 1. Contrast the body of the frog with that of the fish as to regions, shape, and compactness. How do you account for the differences? _Locomotion._ 2. What kinds of locomotion can a frog use? Why is it difficult for a frog to crawl or walk? How far can a frog jump? How are swimming and jumping accomplished? What do you think is the use of the ""hump"" on the back? 3. Identify in the legs the thigh, shank, ankle, foot, toes, and web, and in the arm, the upper arm, forearm, wrist, hand, and fingers. State in detail the differences in structure and in position between the fore and hind limbs. How do you account for these differences? _Feeding._ 4. Induce a frog or toad to eat by dangling food, such as a piece of raw meat or meal worms, small earthworms, etc., before it. How does it seize the food? What will it eat? How is the mouth adapted to this manner of feeding? _Respiration._ 5. The frog has no diaphragm, and therefore no chest cavity; watch very carefully the movements of the mouth, the nostrils, the throat, and the sides of the body to determine how the problem of breathing (how the air is gotten into and out of the lungs) without a diaphragm is solved. Write a detailed account of the frog's method of breathing which shall explain just how the air is forced into the lungs. 6. What would be the effect of propping open the mouth of the frog? Why? Does the frog breathe in the usual manner while under the water? If not, how do you explain its ability to remain under water for a long period of time? _Sense Organs._ 7. Investigate the efficiency of the five special senses in the frog by devising experiments to test each sense; as, for example, giving a frog its liberty on the floor and trying to catch it again, to test the sense of sight. Write an account of your experiments and their results. Which of the senses is best developed? Give reasons for your answer. 8. Compare the eye of the frog with respect to its shape, movements, parts, and protective structures with that of the fish. In what respects are they similar? in what respects different? Why should they differ? 9. Where are the frogs' ears located? What do you think of the efficiency of an eardrum situated on the surface of the body? Why? 10. The frog has certain other responses. Try turning the jar or cage containing a frog around to face the frog in another direction. What happens? How do you explain this response on the basis of use? What other responses have you noticed? _Protection._ 11. Has the frog an exoskeleton? Describe the color scheme of the frog and explain how it may be protective. Why are frogs brighter in spring than in fall? 12. Why do frogs usually live near water? Do they ever leave the vicinity of streams? If so, when? _Summary._ In what ways is the frog adapted to water life? In what ways to life on land? In what respects do toads differ from frogs? The Frog's Mouth _Materials._ Preserved or freshly killed frogs in dishes or shallow pans of water; forceps and a bristle. _Observations._ Open the frog's mouth as widely as possible and, if necessary, insert a splinter to hold the jaws apart. Identify the following structures:-- _Tongue._ Draw it forward until the free end extends from the mouth and is outspread; observe its form, extent, and attachment. _Teeth._ Find those on the jaws and on the roof of the mouth. _Nostrils._ Push the bristle inward through a nostril to determine its direction and extent. _Vocal cords._ These form a hard white mass in the floor of the mouth, well back behind the tongue. _Glottis_, the slit inclosed between the vocal cords, opening into the trachea. _Esophagus_, the passage to the stomach, at the posterior end of the mouth. _Eustachian tubes_, small passages outward to the ears at the junction of the upper and lower jaws. _Questions._ 1. Describe the probable action of the frog's tongue in catching a bug. 2. What advantage can you ascribe to the peculiar mode of attachment of the tongue? 3. Of what use is the notch in the inner end of the tongue? (Note its position when the tongue lies at rest in the mouth.) 4. If the frog chewed its food, how would the existing structure of the nostrils be very inconvenient? 5. Recall either the frog's habit of feeding or the structure of the nostrils. Do you think the nostrils are of much service in smelling? State the reason for your answer. 6. Of what use are the vocal cords and why are they so muscular? Consider their use in sound making and also their condition during swallowing. 7. Of what use are the teeth? Recall the form and use of the fish's teeth. _Suggested drawings._ a. The mouth, wide open and with tongue extended. b. A diagram showing the path of air and of food through the frog's mouth. The Organs of Digestion, Absorption, and Excretion _Materials._ Freshly killed or preserved frogs in dishes or shallow pans of water, forceps, and, if the pupil is to do any dissecting, scissors. _Directions and Observations._ The specimens may have been opened by the teacher, or may be dissected by the pupil as follows:-- Placing the frog on its back, with forceps firmly grasp the skin of the abdomen and the muscles beneath, just in front of the hind legs, and with the scissors cut straight forward in the middle line until the floor of the mouth is reached; this will separate the arms. Care must be taken not to cut too deeply, but this may be avoided by keeping the skin uplifted. Now cut sidewise in front of each hind leg in order that the body wall may be laid aside. Under the arms the heart will be seen; it will be studied as a part of the circulatory system. * * * * * Identify the following organs:-- _Liver_, the large red or brown mass, consisting of several divisions and lying close up under the arms. _Bile sac_, small, green, and between the liver lobes. _Alimentary canal._ 1. _Mouth._ 2. _Esophagus._ 3. _Stomach_, the elongated, light-colored, firm, and muscular portion. 4. _Small intestine_, a slender, more or less closely coiled, tubular portion. 5. _Large intestine_, a thin-walled enlargement at the posterior end of the canal. 6. _Duodenum._ This is a muscular portion of the small intestine immediately following the stomach, against which it is folded. _Pancreas_, a yellowish, pulpy mass lying in the fold between the stomach and the duodenum. _Spleen_, a dark red globule, usually smaller than a pea, lying nearly free among the folds of the small intestine. _Fat bodies_, yellow fringe-like structures, sometimes found near the stomach. _Kidneys_, a pair of elongated dark red organs, behind the spleen and against the back. Note their numerous blood vessels. Possibly the _ureters_, or urinal ducts, can be discovered and traced to their junction with the _bladder_, a clear membranous sac in the posterior extremity of the body cavity. _Peritoneum_, a thin membrane lining the body cavity and attaching the vital organs to the backbone. _Note._--Specimens secured in late fall, winter, or early spring may contain, if female, a large number of dark-colored eggs; or if male, two white testes, located near the kidneys and similar to them in form, though smaller. _Questions._ 1. Name the parts of the frog's alimentary canal. 2. Name the glands or organs which are accessory to the canal. 3. How long is the esophagus? How does the presence or absence of a neck affect the esophagus? 4. How does the thickness of the stomach wall compare with that of the intestine, and how do you account for the difference? 5. Measure the length of the trunk of the frog's body and that of the outstretched alimentary canal. How many times the length of the one is that of the other? How does this ratio compare with that of an herbivorous animal? (The sheep's food canal is about thirty-two times the length of its body.) 6. What is the color of the bile, as seen through the walls of the bile sac? This color is characteristic of carnivorous animals; in herbivorous forms it is yellow. Find its color in some omnivorous form, as man. 7. Name the organs concerned in excretion. 8. What holds the internal organs in place, and from what are they suspended? 9. The spleen is called a ""ductless gland."" Give its function, and explain why a duct is not necessary to it. 10. Since the frog swallows its food alive and entire, what work must the stomach do? What digestive organs would be absent from the mouth, or else poorly developed? 11. Since the frog is carnivorous, what digestive ferments are probably present, and what ones absent from the alimentary canal? 12. Fat bodies are largest in the fall, and are rarely found in the spring. How can you account for this? 13. When through with the general study of the alimentary canal, you may open the stomach by cutting it lengthwise. Describe the character of the stomach lining as to folds and villi, stating the advantage of each being present and the reason for the direction of the folds. Tell how the food is propelled onward through the alimentary canal. Give the scientific name for this action. _Suggested drawings._ a. The viscera (internal organs) undisturbed. b. The alimentary canal extended. c. The excretory system. The Organs of Circulation and Respiration of the Frog _Materials._ The materials used in this exercise are the same as those used in the preceding exercise. _Observations._ The pupil should identify the following structures:-- _Pericardium_, a membrane that surrounds the heart and, in the case of the frog, separates the body cavity into two portions, the _abdomen_ and the _pericardial_ chamber. _Heart_, lying between the shoulders and in front of the false diaphragm. It is conical in form and composed of three chambers. _Ventricle_, the pink, conical, and muscular portion of the heart, pointing backward and outward. _Auricles_, right and left. These are anterior and dorsal to the ventricle, thin, membranous, and dark-colored. _Arterial trunk_, the single large blood vessel, usually empty of blood, and white. Note its origin and trace it as far as possible, at least until you see it divide to encircle the throat. _Sinus venosus_, a large membranous sac dorsal to the heart and connected with the right auricle. _Lungs_, two small oblong, pink, spongy sacs, lying between and behind the shoulders. The pupil may also identify the following structures if a specimen is available which has the blood vessels injected. _Conus arteriosus_, or ""arterial trunk,"" a large artery passing obliquely forward from the ventricle, and dividing into three branches on each side. _Carotid arteries_, the first branches of the conus, to the head and neck. _Aortas_, the second branches of the conus, to the dorsal region. _Pulmocutaneous arteries_, the third branches of the conus, to the lungs and skin. _Dorsal aorta_, the large artery along the back, formed by the union of the two aortas. _Iliac_, or _femoral arteries_, the two posterior divisions of the dorsal aorta, supplying the legs. _Posterior_ (ascending) _vena cava_, a large vein close to the dorsal aorta, passing forward from the kidneys. _Hepatic veins_, large veins connecting the liver with the posterior vena cava. _Anterior_ (descending) _venÃ¦ cavÃ¦_, large veins formed by the junction of the veins from the arm, neck, and head on the right and left sides. _Subclavian veins_, from the arms. _Jugular veins_, from the neck. _Questions._ 1. Of how many chambers does the frog's heart consist? Name them, and describe them as to size, color, and structure. 2. Which chamber receives blood from the body, and which receives blood from the lungs? 3. Name the large arteries and give the regions which they supply. Name the large veins and give the regions from which they come. 4. Describe the lungs as to size, both when inflated and when uninflated. Describe their color; entirety or subdivision; texture. 5. In the inflated lung, notice the interior partitions or chambers, which are called _vesicles_. How do they affect the amount of surface exposed for gas exchange in breathing? 6. Measuring the lung collapsed and again when inflated, calculate its approximate volume in each case and state how much air it may take in during an inspiration. 7. Describe the diaphragm and state its probable use as a factor in respiration or as a partition. _Advanced questions._ 8. Apparently the pure and the impure blood must commingle upon entering the single ventricle, but by a simple device this scarcely occurs. How would such commingling affect the purity of the blood as it reached the tissues, and hence affect waste removal, oxidation, body temperature, activity, and intelligence? 9. What are the chambers of the fish's heart? of the mammalian (human) heart? How may the heart of the frog be regarded as intermediate between these others? How and where might the growth of a partition within it bring about the higher structure? (This actually occurs in certain reptiles.) 10. The lungs are said to be outgrowths of the alimentary canal. Explain how their connection would tend to show this. _Suggested drawings._ a. The heart and lungs in their normal position. b. The circulatory system, as seen in the injected specimen. c. A copy of the diagram or model of the circulatory system. d. A diagram of the respiratory tract from the nostrils to the lungs, by arrows showing the course of the air. The Nervous System of the Frog _Materials._ Specimens which have the brain exposed and other specimens whose viscera have been removed so that the spinal nerves can be seen; pans or shallow dishes of water and forceps. _Observations._ The nerve tissues are generally white in color unless they have been specially treated and stained. The pupil should identify the following structures:-- _A. Brain_, those enlargements of nerve tissue situated in the head and composed of four principal parts, as follows:-- 1. _Cerebral hemispheres_, a pair of elongated lobes, the anterior enlargements. 2. _Mid brain_, or _optic lobes_, a pair of large ovoid structures, projecting diagonally forward and sidewise. 3. _Cerebellum_, a slender, transverse ridge, close behind the midbrain. 4. _Medulla_, the anterior end of the spinal cord, widest in front and containing a triangular depression. (Frequently a pair of smaller enlargements is to be seen in front of the cerebral hemispheres; they are the _olfactory lobes_, and from them nerves pass forward to the nasal chamber.) _B. Spinal cord_, extending along the spine, giving rise to nerves. _C. Spinal nerves_, ten pairs of nerves which are connected with the cord through dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) roots, and which penetrate the body and its appendages. The first enters the neck; the second and third join and enter the arm; the fourth to sixth penetrate the skin and muscles of the trunk; the seventh to ninth join by a plexus to form the sciatic nerve which supplies the leg, and the tenth enters the posterior portion of the body. _Questions._ 1. Which lobes of the brain are paired? Give at least two possible causes or reasons for their double structure. 2. The optic lobes are connected with the eyes. Compare their size with that of the other parts. Of how much use do you think they are to the frog? 3. If folds or convolutions in the surface of the cerebrum indicate intelligence, thoughtfulness, or mind, what do you infer as to the frog's mental condition and power to think? 4.

The Exoskeleton of the Bird: Plumage _Materials._ Living birds, as perhaps pigeons, or mounted or stuffed skins, separate feathers, portions of feathers, microscopes. _Observations._ The pupils should study the arrangement of the feathers and their variations in form and size, and should identify the following principal kinds:-- _Contour feathers_, those feathers, generally broad, which cover the body, giving to it its outline and color. _Coverts_, those feathers which cover joints, such as the joints of the wing and tail. _Primaries_ or _pinions_, the long stiff feathers of the outside of the wing, used in sustaining the bird in flight. _Secondaries_, the shorter, more symmetrical feathers lying next and over the primaries. _Down_, soft feathers found on young birds and next to the skin on some adults. _Thread feathers_, best seen about the eyes, ears, and beak. _Quill_, the bare stiff portion, one end of which is inserted in the skin. Examine its internal structure. _Vane_, the broad expanded portion, the part ordinarily seen on the bird. _Shaft_, the mid-rib of the vane. _Barbs_, the delicate outgrowths of the shaft making up the vane. _Barbules_, the subdivisions of the barbs, some of which are provided with hooklets. These may well be studied microscopically. _Questions._ 1. How is the plumage arranged to offer least resistance to the air in flight? How does a bird sit when exposed to the wind? 2. In a column write the names of the parts of a feather, and opposite each part state its particular use. 3. Of what use are the hooklets on the barbules? 4. State and explain the peculiar position of the shaft of the primary feather; of that of a contour feather. The plumage of many birds contains all stages of feather specialization, from down to pinion. Find as many of them as you can on your specimen. 5. What reason can you assign for the fluffy base and the compact end of the contour feather? 6. How much of the feather of a full-grown bird seems to be supplied with blood vessels? How does this bloodless or full-blooded condition affect the weight of the feather; of the plumage; of the bird? 7. How would the above condition affect the temperature of the blood and of the body? Would it tend to cool the animal or to conserve its heat? 8. Show how the air lying motionless amongst the plumage may serve the same purpose as that in the packing of a fireless cooker or a ""thermos bottle."" 9. How would the above condition affect the growth and repair of the feather? What connection has it with moulting? 10. What kind of feathers forms most birds' ""baby clothes""? What kind forms the adults' ""underclothes""? _Suggested drawings._ a. A typical feather. b. A feather of each kind. c. A bird with wings outspread, showing positions of feathers. d. The minute structure of a feather. Birds and Migration _To illustrate Distribution_ Work in the Laboratory _Materials._ Bird skins or mounted birds, at least one representative of each order and, better still, of each family of the birds which pass through or remain in your neighborhood; specimens in a museum may also be used. Some guide to the identification of birds, as Walter's ""Wild Birds in City Parks"" or Reed's ""Bird Guide."" A good diagram of a bird. _Directions._ Your object here is to familiarize yourself with the appearance of birds of different types, and with the terms used in describing them. Study first a diagram of a bird and learn the terms and their applications. An important item in the description of a bird is its length. This is obtained by measuring from the tip of the beak, over the curve of the head, to the end of the tail. This measures a curved line and gives a greater length for a bird than the straight line you would naturally estimate. Train your eye by watching house sparrows (so-called English sparrows) and fixing their length as a unit. They are called six inches long, and in the field other birds may be measured by them. The robin is ten inches long, and may be used to measure the larger birds. In describing the colors of birds, great discussions often arise because pupils do not use terms correctly. Consult Chapman's ""Birds of Eastern North America"" for a color key or chart, and train yourself to observe colors carefully and name them correctly. You will find more colors among birds than are given there, but the chart will help you a great deal. Study in the laboratory as many birds as you can. Try to get one of each order at least and, among the perching birds, one of each family. The answers to the following questions should be recorded upon the blank outlines of birds, or else in the form of a table. _Questions._ 1. How long is the bird? 2. What is the general color of the upper surface; of the lower? 3. What are the markings or peculiarities of the head, if there are any? 4. Note any peculiarities of the tail, as to shape, length, or color, if there are any. 5. If the wings are not like the back, note their color, and, if there are wing bars, note their number and color. 6. What are the markings on the breast, if there are any? 7. Note any other markings, as rump spot, etc. 8. What sort of beak has the bird? 9. What sort of feet has it? 10. Identify the bird, using any key or guide you have. Do not ask any one to help you until you have exhausted your own resources. Comparative Study of Birds 1. In what ways do the feet of birds vary? Give examples to illustrate your answer. What are the principal results of these variations? 2. In what ways do the beaks of birds vary? Give examples of the variations and of the special uses of the beaks. 3. How do water birds differ from land birds; flesh-eating birds from seed eaters; insect-eating birds from seed eaters; shore and swamp birds from land birds? Work in the Field _Materials._ (1) Birds in the field, field or opera glasses, and bird guides. (2) Some extra time, as field work is rather slow. (3) Considerable energy, as birds rise early and may be up and away before the usual hour for your appearance. _Directions._ The object of this work is to become acquainted with the living bird, to learn not only its name, but also some of its ways. You will need to spend time to do this, and as a rule the more time you spend the more you will see. Every time you go out after birds, _record at the time_ every kind of bird you see, so that at the end of the season you will know not only when each kind of bird came, but also how long it staid. When you see a new bird, record immediately its colors, markings, actions, notes, and anything else which may help you later to identify it. Do not trust to memory nor to the inspiration of the classroom. After weeks of observation, write the following summary. Summary of the Results of Field Study of Birds 1.

Study of the Migration of Animals in General The migration of birds is only one case of a phenomenon which is comparatively common. From your text and reference books find other examples of migration. What are the causes which make animals migrate? What methods do various animals use? What are some results of these migrations? Summarize your study in the following thesis:-- _The distribution of animals._ 1. The necessity for this distribution. 2. Methods of distribution--voluntary--involuntary. _Note._--See in review the methods used to spread corals, hydroids, and other sedentary forms, starfish, clams, etc., as well as those used by the various vertebrates. 3. Time when migration occurs. Consider here the young of most animals, and the movements of many birds, as well as movements caused by some accidental occurrence. 4.

The Horse The pupil is expected to study carefully the account of Eohippus or Hyracotherium in his text or any other available reference book, and to supplement that work and this brief sketch with original observations upon horses on the street, at a local store, or wherever possible or convenient. From the early horses which migrated from North America there arose in Asia and Africa the ass, famous in the history of early civilization and still used in some localities as beasts of burden or for the breeding of mules, which are the crosses between ass and horse. There also arose the zebra and the most primitive of modern horses, Przewalskii's horse, a wild pony of western China, about forty inches high and almost identical with the drawings of the horse made by early man, 30,000 years ago. Doubtless the modern ponies of Ireland, Iceland, and Shetland are descendants of the original Przewalskii type and not, as is often claimed, true horses stunted by rigors of climate and scant fare. The horse is characterized largely by the presence of a lock of hair between the ears, a full mane and tail, small ears, large hoofs, and peculiar neigh. The ass has no forelock, a scanty mane and tail, long ears, small hoofs, and a distinct bray. By means of various crusades and raids, the modern horse was introduced into Europe from Asia, where it is clearly traced in history to the reign of King Solomon. Here, in Europe, because of local conditions and demands, it assumed differing type forms. The roadster type is closest to the Arabian in character. The draft or heavy type was bred in western Europe when heavy armor came into use for rider and horse, and the coach or carriage type was developed when armor was abandoned for gunpowder. Finally explorers and colonists brought the horse back to America, its original home. The various types and varieties may be briefly described. _A._ The draft type has short legs, short neck, large round body, and ranges in weight from 1400 pounds to 2000 pounds. _Varieties:--_ 1. _Percheron_: generally about 1700 pounds in weight, 16 hands (64 inches) high, gray or black, blocky body, steep rump, clean legs, and quick action. 2. _Shire_: generally about 1800 pounds in weight, 17 hands high, bay or brown, white marked feet and face, hairy legs and feet, and slow action. 3. _Belgian_: generally about 1800 pounds in weight, 16 hands high, chestnut or roan in color, compact body, short, steep rump, and small feet. _B._ The coach or carriage type has legs and neck of medium length, a body full-chested but not blocky, and a weight varying from 1150 pounds to 1400 pounds. _Varieties:--_ 1. _Hackney_: generally of full, broad, powerful body, short legs and back, high action and high carriage of neck and head, bay or chestnut in color, 15 hands high, and 1400 pounds in weight. 2. _Coach_: generally lighter than the Hackney, with longer legs and long stride; height, 16 hands; weight, 1300 pounds. 3. _Cleveland bay_: averaging 16-1/2 hands in height, 1350 pounds in weight, high, broad hips, strong action, and bay color. _C._ The roadster type is long and lean of limb and body, and averages about 1100 pounds in weight. _Varieties:--_ 1. _Thoroughbred_: of small head, long neck, level back, of variable color, 14-1/2--16-1/2 hands high, about 1000 pounds in weight. 2. _American saddle_: an American production; not a distinct breed, but a roadster of high quality. 3. _American trotter_: a superior type of good speed. The off forefoot and the nigh hind foot act together, the nigh fore and the off hind feet together, giving a two-beat gait. 4. _Pacer_: similar to the trotter, but using both off feet and both nigh feet together, giving a swinging gait. The horse is very similar to man in its physical and mental character, being subject to the same ailments and treatment and having the same impulses of affection, hatred, fear, jealousy, obedience, willfulness, memory, and perhaps reason. It is of all animals most careful in its eating and drinking; because its stomach is small, the food should not be bulky but concentrated, grain forming a goodly portion of the ration. Perhaps the most important point in the structure of the horse is the form of the leg and foot. The shoulder should slope slightly backward and the pastern joint, immediately above the hoof, slightly backward. The hips, or ""quarters,"" should slope downward somewhat, and the hock should be comparatively wide to afford ample leverage for the pulling muscles. The legs should be straight as pillars when seen from front or rear. The outer walls of the hoof support most of the weight though the frog should normally touch the ground. In nature the hoof wears away properly of itself, but the shod hoof needs regular trimming attention, while the frog must not be trimmed, for it is the soft growing part that nourishes the hoof. In this treatment the foot is comparable with the human finger and finger nail. _Observations._ If access to a living animal is impossible or inconvenient, the pupil may use reference book or pictures for most of these points. A measuring tape or ruler should be at hand, and the assistance of an experienced person is a valuable aid. If several horses are studied, they should be distinguished by name or number. Record the color, condition, weight, and height of the horse at the shoulder. (Height is given in ""hands,"" a hand being the breadth of the palm, or 4 inches.) Note the slope of the shoulder, of the back and the hips, the general form of the head and neck, and the facial expression. Find the chestnuts, warty growths on the inside of each leg. Examine the foot, finding the V-shaped frog in the center, surrounded by the horny hoof. Find the pulse by passing the fingers downward from the upper curve of the neck, along the inside of the jaw; count the pulse. Notice the position and motion of the ears with their lining of hair, and the position of the eyes, the form of the pupil, and the probable range of vision. Watch the horse use its lips, and examine the mouth and teeth, finding the grinding teeth far back in the mouth, the incisors in front, and the space where the canines are missing. The male may have canines in the upper jaw. On the surfaces of the incisors are the depressions, or ""cups,"" by means of which age is determined. At six years the cups leave the lower center teeth; at seven the adjoining teeth; and at eight, the outer lower teeth. At nine years they leave the upper center incisors; at ten, the adjoining teeth; and at eleven, the outer teeth above. At the age of ten years a spot appears in the outer upper incisors, at fifteen years the groove has worn to the center of the tooth, and at twenty-one years the groove is worn to the bottom of the tooth. _Questions._ 1. Describe the horse you studied as to its name or number, its color, markings, weight, and size. Of what type and breed is it a specimen? 2. Upon how much of the foot does the horse walk? How does this affect ease or speed of action? How does an athlete imitate this in sprinting? 3. How many toes has each foot? What advantage or disadvantage can you see in this unusual structure? 4.

Homology of the Vertebrate Skeleton _Materials._ Prepared skeletons of an amphibian, a reptile, a bird, another mammal, and man. If any of these be lacking, lantern-slide illustrations may be used in a partially darkened room. _Observations._ Having studied the frog's skeleton in detail, the student can readily compare each of these types with it. Compare in a very general way the skulls, the girdles, and the limbs; their form and use. Note variations in the form and number of the vertebrÃ¦ and the number of the ribs. _Questions._ 1. In which types of vertebrates are the joints between the skull bones bound with cartilage? How does the joining change in later types? 2. What dissimilarities occur in the series as regards closure or boxing in of the eye orbits, nostrils, and skull bones? How would these changes in joining and closure affect strength, rigidity, and protection? 3. What evidence is there that such improvement has affected brain capacity and intelligence? 4. State how the attachment of the skull to the vertebral column changes as the animal man assumes an erect position. 5. Are the vertebrÃ¦ of these types alike in structure? What is the general form of an horizontally placed vertebra, as in the horse or a reptile, and of a vertically placed one, as in man? If you see any differences, account for them. 6. Wherever possible, find the vertebrÃ¦ of the neck (cervical), and note the number of them in each case. 7. How is flexibility of the column accomplished in certain types or in certain places of one type? How is rigidity gained? State instances in each answer. 8. Examining the interior of the turtle's ""shell,"" find out and explain how the vertebrÃ¦ have been modified to form the upper ""shell."" How has the under portion (_plastron_) been formed? 9. In round numbers, which skeleton has the greatest number of vertebrÃ¦ and which the least? 10. Which skeleton has the greatest number of ribs, and which has the least? 11. In a summarizing statement explain any variations you find in the pectoral and pelvic girdle for strength (rigidity); flexibility. This answer may be written as a table, naming the bones, opposite each stating its condition, and then what it affords or is adapted to. 12. What is accomplished by having two bones in the shank of the leg? In what types or forms is there but one, and which one is it? 13. Can you assign any advantages in power, agility, length of leg, or position of leg and foot accruing from a long ankle? (See horse, frog, _et al._) 14. Enumerate the types or forms, and opposite each state the number of fingers and toes. 15. Make a table, heading one column ""Form or type""; another, ""Habitat""; and a third, ""Habit."" Judging from the structure which you see or from your previous knowledge or experience, fill in the table, stating whether the type is aquatic, terrestrial, or aÃ«rial; whether it burrows, walks, runs, or climbs, etc. 16. From your statements in 15, explain how the peculiar mode of life affects the structure of these types. CHAPTER VII ADAPTATIONS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES #A. METHODS OF REPRODUCTION# 1.

Why is reproduction necessary? #B. DEVELOPMENT# 1. The Hen's Egg _Materials._ Hen's eggs, hydrochloric acid. _Definitions._ _Germ spot_, a white spot, imbedded in the ""yolk."" This is the point at which development begins. _Yolk_, the yellow portion of a bird's egg. This is a food material, rich in fat. _Albumen_, the white, viscous portion of a bird's egg. _Chalaza_, the spiral portion of albumen always seen in the bird's egg. _Directions._ Boil an egg at least ten minutes in water deep enough to cover it. Note which side is uppermost and mark this part of the shell for reference. Remove the egg and pick away the shell from about half the egg, leaving the shell on that portion which was underneath when placed in water. With a sharp knife remove this half of the egg. Note the thickness of the shell. Test its composition (use hydrochloric acid). Find the membrane lining the shell and note that at one end it separates into two parts to inclose an air space. 1. What is this for? How does it change after an egg has been incubated for a week or more? Break an uncooked egg in a saucer. Note the germ spot. Note also the difference in the consistency of the ""white"" (albumen) and yellow portion (""yolk""). 2. Why does the latter retain its shape? 3. Why do the white and yolk not mix unless shaken or beaten together? 4. Look for the chalaza. 5. What do you think is the use of this structure? Weigh a fresh egg, place it in a dry atmosphere for a week, and weigh it again. Record result. Why may eggs be kept a long time perfectly fresh if coated with paraffin or if put in ""water glass""? _Suggested drawings._ a. The egg as it appears in the saucer. b. The egg after part of the shell has been removed. 2.

Development of the Chick _Materials._ An incubator, a brooder, a setting of eggs. _Directions._ Read carefully the directions for setting up and regulating the incubator. Remember that the temperature should average 103 degrees and should not vary more than two or three degrees above or below this. Candle the eggs from time to time and note difference in appearance, as development proceeds, especially as to transparency and size of the air space. An egg that is transparent after ten days is probably infertile and should be removed. Eggs which are developing properly will show from this time on a well developed air space, and will be quite opaque. The veins often give a spider-web appearance. Twice each day remove the tray of eggs and allow to cool slightly. Once a day the eggs should be turned before the tray is returned to the incubator. _Questions._ 1. Describe the appearance of the shell when the chick is about to come out. In about how many days after you put the eggs in the incubator did you first note this change? You should watch the incubator carefully from the eighteenth day on. 2. What proportion of the eggs hatched? What reasons can you suggest for the failure of some to hatch? Did any which were pipped fail to hatch? If so, break them open and see if you can discover the trouble. 3. How does the chick get out of the shell? How long does it take for it to get out after the shell is chipped? How does a chick look as soon as it has come out of the shell? 4. With what is a chick covered when it is first hatched? How long before feathers begin to develop? 5. How long before a chick needs food? How does it recognize it? _Summary._ 1. What are the two kinds of development? 2.

CHAPTER VIII POULTRY _Materials._ Either pictures or specimens of the different breeds of fowl. _General Information._ Under the term poultry are included chickens as well as turkeys, pigeons, ducks, geese, etc. Chickens are most generally raised, since they do not require such special conditions as the others. In this exercise only this form of poultry is considered. The hen has been domesticated from prehistoric times, being probably derived from the so-called jungle fowl of India (_Gallus bankiva_), which is still to be found in its native habitat. Through constant attempts to improve the domestic fowl along the lines of greater egg-production, size, etc., there have been developed a great many different breeds of fowl. These may be divided into seven groups, as follows: 1. The American Class. 2. The Asiatic Class. 3. The Mediterranean Class. 4. The English Class. 5. The Dutch Class. 6. The French Class. 7. The Ornamental and Exhibition Classes. The American Class includes fowls raised both for egg-production and for eating. It includes the following well-known breeds: the Plymouth Rocks, the Wyandottes, the Rhode Island Reds, and the less-known breeds of Javas, Dominiques, and Jersey Blues. These all lay good-sized brown eggs, are good winter layers, and stand confinement well. The standard weight varies from six and one half pounds to seven and one half pounds for the hen, and from eight and one half pounds to nine and one half pounds for the cock, the Plymouth Rocks being the heaviest of the breeds. There are three principal varieties of Plymouth Rocks--the Barred Rocks, with grayish-white plumage regularly crossed with bars of blue-black, the White Rocks, and the Buff Rocks. All have single upright combs, which, with the wattles and the ear lobes, are bright red, a large bright eye, and yellow legs. There are also three principal varieties of Wyandottes. The Silver-laced Wyandotte has a silvery-white plumage, with black markings in various parts of the body. The Golden Wyandotte is similar in its markings, but has yellow where the Silver-laced has white. The White Wyandotte is pure white. All have rose combs, red ear lobes, and yellow legs. They are on the average about a pound lighter than the Plymouth Rocks. The Rhode Island Reds are a much more recent breed that has of late become very popular. They are of a reddish-brown color, about the weight of the Wyandotte, with yellow legs. There are both single combed and rose combed varieties. The Asiatic Class includes those breeds raised chiefly for the table. The Brahmas, Cochins, and Langshans are the chief breeds. They are considerably heavier than other breeds, and are specially characterized by the feathers on the legs and feet. They all lay brown eggs, and are in many cases good layers. The Brahmas include two principal varieties, the light and the dark. The general color is black and white, and they have yellow legs, red wattles, ear lobes, and comb, the latter being of the kind called a pea-comb, which is of small size in the cock. There are four varieties of Cochins, the Buff being much more raised than the Partridge, the White, or the Black. The Partridge somewhat resembles a dark Brahma, but has red and brown plumage. Cochins have single combs, yellow legs, and a general fluffy character to the plumage, that of saddle and hackle meeting, thus giving a characteristic appearance to these fowls. The eggs are not quite so large as the other two breeds of this class. The Langshans are smaller and more active than the two breeds just described. They have black legs, the feet are not so heavily feathered, and in general these fowls are much less awkward in appearance. There are two varieties, the White and the Black. The Mediterranean Class includes those breeds raised chiefly because of their great egg-production. They are active birds, often troublesome because of their ability to fly over high enclosures, so that when kept in the city it is usually necessary to clip one wing. They are not so good winter layers as a rule, but are non-setters. They all lay white eggs. The chief breeds included are the Leghorns, the Minorcas, and the Black Spanish. The Leghorns--the most popular of these breeds--include two chief varieties, the Brown and the White. The comb is most commonly single, falling to one side in the hen, the wattles long and pendulous, the ear lobes white, and the legs yellow. The Minorcas are glossy black in color, with a large drooping comb in the hen, and long, thin, pendulous wattle. They lay a very large egg. The Black Spanish resemble the Minorcas, but are distinguished by the white face and cheeks and the white on the inner edge of the wattles. The English Class includes the Orpingtons and the Dorkings. The Dorkings are one of the oldest breeds of fowl, and sufficiently identified by the presence of a fifth toe. There are three varieties--the White, the Silver-gray, and the Colored. The White Dorking has a rose comb; the Silver-gray has a single comb and silvery-gray plumage with black markings, the hen having a salmon-colored breast; the Colored Dorkings have sometimes single and sometimes rose combs, the plumage of the cock being black and straw-colored and that of the hen being black and gray with the breast salmon marked with black. The Orpingtons are short legged, with close plumage. They are of large size, the hens being from seven to eight pounds and the cocks from nine to ten pounds. There are three varieties--the black, the buff, and the white. The black, except for shape, might be mistaken for a Minorca, but has red ear lobes and black shanks. The Orpingtons have the reputation of maturing early, some strains being known to lay when four months old. The Dutch Class includes the Red-caps, the Campines, and the various varieties of the Hamburgs--of which there are six: the Golden Spangled, the Silver Spangled, the Golden Penciled, the Silver Penciled, the Black and the White. They are all good layers and non-setters, ""but lay a small egg, white in color. They are readily recognized by their peculiar rose comb with its long, spikelike projection in the back, their red face, white ear lobes, and bluish legs. The prevailing color of the golden varieties is a reddish bay marked with black and of the silver varieties white marked with black. The cock usually has more dark markings than the hen. The Red-caps are large fowl with a red and black plumage. The comb is similar to the Hamburg's but larger, and the ear lobes are red. The Campines resemble the Hamburgs, but have a single comb. The French Class includes the Houdans, the Crevecoeurs, and the La Fleche. The Houdans are mottled black and white with pinkish white legs, with a fifth toe like the Dorkings, and are easily recognized by their peculiar crest. The other breeds of fowl, like the crested Polish, Bantams, and game fowl, have less interest for the poultry raiser, though often seen in exhibitions and poultry shows. To sum up, we may group all these breeds according to their value into (1) the egg breeds, including the Leghorn, Minorca, Spanish, and Red-cap; (2) the meat breeds, including the Brahmas, Cochins, and Langshans; (3) the general purpose breeds, including the Plymouth Rocks, Wyandottes, Rhode Island Reds, Dorkings, and Orpingtons; and (4) the fancy breeds, including the Polish, Bantams, Games, etc. _Definitions._ American Standard of Perfection, an illustrated volume published by the American Poultry Association, indicating the desirable points of each recognized breed of fowl. _Comb_, the fleshy outgrowth on the head. _Single comb_, a thin, upright comb. _Rose comb_, a flat comb with a rough or corrugated surface. _Pea comb_, resembling three single combs, united at the back. _Wattles_, the fleshy outgrowths from the underside of the throat. _Ear lobes_, the fleshy structure in the region of the ear. _Under-color_, the color noted when the coverts are raised. _Hackle_, the feathers on the neck. _Cape_, the feathers back of the hackle. _Saddle_, the feathers in the posterior region of the back. _Sickle_, the curved feathers of the tail in the cock. _Penciling_, small stripes or color markings on the feather. _Spangling_, large spots or splotches of color on the feather. _Shanks_, the exposed scaly portions of the legs, usually spoken of as the ""legs."" _Questions and observations._ 1. Make a diagrammatic sketch of a fowl and locate the principal regions used in the description of the various breeds. 2. Observing the specimens or the pictures of the fowls at hand, note the size and kind of comb, the appearance of the wattles, the color of the eyes and ear lobes, the color in the various regions of the body, the color and any peculiarity of the legs and feet. If you wish, you may record your answers in tabular form. _Topics for investigation._ 1.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢ Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundationâs website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

Sometime early in the spring of 1903, a letter was received from a man in Pennsylvania and published in H-T-T, which a few weeks later brought to light one of the truest and best sportsmen that ever shouldered a gun, strung a snare or set a trap--E. N. Woodcock. Some of the happenings are repeated and all dates may not be correct, for be it remembered that Mr. Woodcock has written all from memory. It is doubtful if he kept all copies of H-T-T, therefore was not sure if such and such incidents had been written before. In most cases these are somewhat different and as they all ""fit in"" we have used them as written and published from time to time. Much information is also contained in the writings of Mr. Woodcock and whether you use gun, steel traps, deadfalls or snares, you will find something of value. The articles are also written in a style that impresses all of their truthfulness, but, so written that they are very interesting. Those of our readers who have read his articles will be glad of this opportunity to get his writings in book form, while those that have only read a few of his more recent articles will be pleased to secure all. Perhaps the following editorial which appeared in H-T-T will be in place here: ""Although crippled with rheumatism, there is an old hunter and trapper living in Potter County, Pa., whose enthusiasm is high and his greatest desire is still to get out over the trap lines a few seasons before the end of the ""trail"" of life's journey is reached. May that desire be fulfilled is the earnest wish of the H-T-T as well as thousands of our readers, who have read the writings of this kind-hearted and wide experienced hunter and trapper, as they have been penned from his home near the Allegheny Mountains. It is with pleasure that we publish in this issue the ""Autobiography of E. N. Woodcock as a Trapper."" During his half century with trap and gun, he has had some narrow escapes and experiences, but not the many ""hair-breadth escapes"" that some claim, but which only occur on paper. Mr. Woodcock is a truthful man, and you can read his autobiography knowing that it is the truth even to the minutest detail."" The autobiography was written by Mr. Woodcock at the request of the Editor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper in the spring of 1908 and published July of the same year. We are glad to add that since that time, Mr. Woodcock has enjoyed several hunting and trapping expeditions. Some were in his home state--Pennsylvania--on same grounds, or at least near those he camped on many, many years ago. He also took a couple of trips into the south--fall of 1911 and 1912. He was in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. An account of these hunts is given in Chapters XXX, XXXI and XXXII. In May, 1912, the Editor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper visited Mr. Woodcock and family at their home some four miles from Coudersport, Pennsylvania. Mr. Woodcock, though physically not large, is a wonderful man in the ""ways of the woods."" He is not given to exaggeration or boasting like many a man who has followed the Trail and Trap Line. Every word that he says or writes can be put down as truthful beyond a doubt. At this time, (May, 1912) he was afraid he would never be able to get out on the trap line again, as he was suffering from rheumatism and heart trouble. Towards fall he became better, and enjoyed the sport, which for more than fifty years has been his--may he be spared to enjoy many more. By noting the dates as given in connection with various articles published, it will be seen that Mr. Woodcock shortly after 1900 began to point out the need of protection to game and fur animals. After a life on the trap and trail of more than fifty years, such advice should be far reaching. Mr. Woodcock is a man of unusual foresight and knowing that he is nearing the end of the trail, wishes to forcibly impress the needs of protection. By referring to a good map, you will be able to see the location of many of Mr. Woodcock's hunting, camping and trapping trips, as he generally mentions State, County and Streams. Very few men have had wider experience than Mr. Woodcock. He knows from more than a half century much of the habits and characteristics of animals. He gives his reasons why marten are plentiful in one section and are gone in a few days. His reason too, looks plausible. He describes trapping wolves in Upper Michigan about 1880, also beaver. Tells how he caught the ""shadow of the forests"" as wolves are often called by trappers--they are so hard to trap. By reading of his many experiences you will not only enjoy what he says, but will get facts about bear, deer, fox, wolves, mink, marten and other fur bearers that you had never thought of. This man, while on the ""trail"" upwards of fifty years, so far as known never killed out of season or trapped unprime furs. A WORD FROM MR. WOODCOCK. The editor of HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER has requested a foreword of introductory to FIFTY YEARS A HUNTER AND TRAPPER OR EXPERIENCE OF E. N. WOODCOCK, saying that so many have enjoyed my articles, which have appeared from time to time in HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER, extending over a period of some ten years, 1903 to 1913, that same are to be published in book form. I was born at Lymansville, Potter County, Pennsylvania, August 30, 1844. From early childhood, my nature led me to the Forests and Streams. I have hunted in many of the states of the Far West including the three Pacific States--California, Oregon and Washington. I killed my first panther or cougar in the mountains of Idaho on the headwaters of the Clearwater river. My first real experience in wolfing was in Southeastern Oregon. I met my greatest number of deer in Northwestern California. I have trapped of late years, in nearly all of the states east of the Mississippi river and also on the White River of Arkansas; also trapped bear and other fur bearing animals and hunted deer in Northern Michigan, also forty years ago. Another sport which I enjoyed was the ""pigeon days."" I have netted wild pigeons from the Adirondack Mountains in New York state to Indian Territory--now Oklahoma--trapping them in the states of Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York. My nature led me to the Trail and Trap line from early childhood and I have trapped bear and hunted deer in the mountains of Pennsylvania for more than 50 years--half a century--and my picture with my two foxes on my shoulder shows me on the trap line for the season of 1912-13. March 1, 1913. E. N. WOODCOCK. CHAPTER I. Autobiography of E. N. Woodcock. I was born on the 30th day of August, A. D. 1844, in a little village by the name of Lymansville, Potter County, Pennsylvania. Lymansville was named after my grandparent, Isaac Lyman, or better known as Major Lyman, having held office of that rank in the Revolutionary War. It is from this limb of the family that I inherited that uncontrollable desire for the trap, gun and the wild. At a very early age it was my greatest delight to have all the mice, squirrels and groundhogs and in later years young raccoons, young fox and every other varmint or wild animal that I could catch or could get from other sources, and at times I had quite a menagerie. I began trapping at a very early age, the same as many boys do who live out in the country where they have an opportunity. My father owned a grist mill and a sawmill. These mills were about one-half mile apart and it was about these mills and along the mill races and ponds of these mills that I set my first traps for muskrats, mink and coon. Before I was stout enough to set a trap which was strong enough to hold the varmint, it was necessary for me to get some older person to set the trap. I would take the trap to the intended place and set for the particular animals I was in quest of, whether mink, coon or rat. In those days clearings were small, woods large and full of game. Deer could be seen in bunches every morning in the fields and it was not uncommon to see a bear's track near the house that had been made during the night. Wolves were not plenty though it was a common thing to see their tracks and sometimes hear them howl on the hills. Like other boys who lead an outdoor life, I grew stronger each year and as I grew older and stronger my trap lines grew longer and my hunts took me farther into the woods. Finally as game became scarcer my hunts grew from a few hours in length to weeks and months camping in a cabin built in the woods in a section where game was plenty. At the age of thirteen while out with a party of men on a hunting and fishing trip, I killed my first bear. While I had now been out each fall with my traps and gun, it was not until I was about eighteen years old that I took my first lesson from an old and experienced trapper, a man nearly eighty years old and a trapper and hunter from boyhood. The man's name was Aleck Harris. We made our camp in the extreme southeastern part of this (Potter) County in a section known as ""The Black Forest"" and it was here that I learned many things from an experienced trapper and hunter that served me well on the trap line and the trail, in the years that followed. It was here that I made my first bed in a foot or more of snow with a fire against a fallen tree and a few boughs thrown on the ground for a bed. At other times perhaps a bear skin just removed from the bear for covering, or I might have no covering other than to remove my coat and spread it over me. This I have often done when belated on the trail so that I was unable to reach the cabin and was happy and contented. It was here I first learned to do up the saddles or the carcass of a deer in the more convenient way to carry. It was here that I took my first practical lessons in skinning, stretching, curing and handling of skins and furs. I also learned many things of traps and trapping and to do away with sheath knives and other unnecessary burdens on the trap line. In my younger days I preferred to ""go it alone"" when in a country that I was familiar with and many a week I have spent in my cabin alone save for my faithful dog, but as I grew older and became afflicted with rheumatism I have found a partner more acceptable. I have met with many queer circumstances while on the trap line and trail, yet I have never met with any of those bloodcurdling and hair-breadth escapes from wild animals which are mostly ""pipe dreams"". Perhaps the nearest I ever came to being seriously hurt by a wild animal was from a large buck deer. It was in November and on a stormy day. I had killed a doe and was in the act of dressing the doe and was leaning over the deer at work. I was within a few feet of a fallen tree. Hearing a slight noise, I raised up to see what caused it, when with the speed of a cannon ball a buck flew past me, barely missing and landed six or eight feet beyond me. The deer had come up to this fallen tree on the track of the doe and seeing me at work over the doe, became angered and sprung at me and only my straightening up at the very instant that I did saved me from being seriously hurt or perhaps killed. I sprang over the log. The deer stood and gazed at me for a moment. His eyes were of a green hue and the hair on his back all stuck up towards his head. After gazing at me for a moment the deer walked slowly away. The suddenness of the occurrence so unnerved me that I was unable to shoot for some minutes though my gun was standing against the tree within reach. At another time I was somewhat frightened by what I supposed was a dead bear suddenly coming to life. I had caught the bear in a trap and it had got fastened in some saplings growing on the steep bank of a small brook. I shot the bear in the head, as I thought, and it fell over the bank in such a manner that his whole weight was held by the leg that was fast in the trap. I was unable to release it from the trap where it was hanging as I had no clamp to put the trap springs down with, to release the bear's foot. I had set my gun, a single barrel rifle, against a tree without reloading it. I cut the bear's paw off close to the trap which allowed the animal to roll down the bank to level ground. I had begun to rip down the leg that had been caught in the trap. A lad of about ten years was with me having accompanied me to attend the traps that day. The lad stood looking on when all of a sudden he said, ""See him wink."" I stopped my work and glanced at the bear's eyes and sure enough he was winking and winking fast, too, and almost before I knew it the bear was trying to get onto his feet. My gun was unloaded and the lad was screaming at the top of his voice, ""Kill him! Kill him!"" But what was I to kill him with? Nothing came to my mind at first except to use my gun as a club but I did not like to break it. In a moment I thought of my hatchet which I had taken from the holster and laid on the bank where I had cut the bear's foot off to release him from the trap. I grabbed the hatchet and one good blow on the head put a stop to the rumpus and nobody harmed, although the boy was badly frightened. At another time I might have got into trouble with a bear also caught in a trap. I was quite young at this time. I had gone some ten or twelve miles from home and set a trap for a bear. The trap was rather a poor one with a very light chain for a bear trap. I had only set the trap a few days before yet I thought I must go and look after it, but it was more the desire to be in the woods than it was of expecting to have a bear in the trap at that time. I did not take a gun with me, only a revolver loaded as I had no more balls and this was before the days of fixed ammunition. When I came to the trap there was an ugly bear in it and he had the clog fast in some roots and among some fallen trees. After firing one shot at the Bear's head, which I missed, I then shot the two remaining balls into the bear's body with the only effect of making him more determined to get at me. I now cut a good club determined to put a quietus on Bruin in that manner but after landing several blows my knees began to feel weak. I gave up the job and returned home leaving Bruin in the trap feeling as well as he did when I first found him, so far as I was able to see. But when I returned the next morning with help and now with a regular gun we found Bruin nearly dead and helpless from the shots that I had given him the day before from the revolver. I have met with other circumstances not quite so fascinating as those just related. At one time a young companion and I were camping and trapping several miles from home and several miles from a road. One day while we were some ways out from camp setting traps my friend became suddenly very ill. It required no skilled doctor to see that it was a case that must have help at once. I started with my friend to get to camp. While my companion was not as old as I, he was larger and heavier. I worked along with him, half carrying him, while he would support himself as best he could. I got him within about a mile of the cabin when he completely gave out and could go no farther and with all my pleadings I could not get him to try to go any farther, but he promised that if I went after help that after resting he would work his way to camp. Seeing that there was no other way to do, I left him and started for help. It was now dark. My way was over a road of about twelve miles and nearly all the way through a thick woods and part of the way without a road other than a path. When I reached the cabin I stopped long enough to build a fire so that the cabin would be warm when my companion got there if he did get there at all, which I doubted. I took a lunch in my hand and started for help. I would take a trot whenever the woods were sufficiently open to let in light enough so that I could see my way. I got to my companion's home about midnight and we were soon on the way back with a team and wagon while my companion's father went after a doctor to have him there when we got back with the patient. We drove with the wagon as far as the road would allow, then we left the wagon and rode the horses to the camp. When we reached the cabin, contrary to expectations, we found my companion there but very sick. We lost no time in getting him onto a horse and starting for the wagon where we had a bed for the patient to lie down on. We got home about eight o'clock in the morning. The doctor was waiting for us and he said as soon as he looked at the man that it was a bad case of typhoid fever. He was right, for it took many weeks before my friend was able to be out again. When game began to get scarce, that is when game was no longer found plenty right at the door, I began to look for parts where game was plentiful and accordingly, with three companions, I arranged to hunt and trap on Thunder Bay River in Michigan, where deer and all kinds of game, we had been told, were plenty and also lots of fur bearers. This we found to be quite true but the state had passed a law forbidding the shipment of deer. We did not know this when we left home and two of the boys soon got discouraged and returned. It was while hunting here that I had another trip of twenty miles through the woods over rough corduroy tote road in the night after a team to take my companion (Vanater by name) out to Alpena to have a broken leg set. He was carrying a deer on his shoulder and when near camp it was necessary to cross a small stream to get to the cabin. We had felled a small tree across the creek for the purpose of crossing. There was three or four inches of snow on the log and after my companion was across the creek and just as he was about to step from the log he slipped and fell, striking his leg across the log in some manner so that it broke between the knee and ankle. After getting my companion to camp and making him as comfortable as possible, I took a lunch in my knapsack and with an old tin lantern with a tallow candle in it, which gave about as much light as a lightning bug, I started over the longest and roughest twenty miles of road that I ever traveled in the night. Sometimes I would trip on some stick or log and fall and put out my light but I would get up, light the candle in the lantern again and hurry on all the faster to make up for lost time. I made the journey all right and was back to camp the next day before noon where we found my companion doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances. We got my companion out to Alpena where the doctor set the leg and in the course of two or three weeks he was so far recovered that he was able to return to camp and keep me company until he was able to again take up the trap line and trail. Some years later I again went back to Michigan and hunted deer and trapped on the Manistee, Boardman and Rapid Rivers, but I found game and furs had become somewhat scarce in that part so I next went with a partner to upper Michigan. At that time there was no railroad in Upper Michigan and but few settlers, after leaving the Straits, until near Lake Superior and near the copper and iron mines. I have tried my luck in three of the states west of the Rocky Mountains. In the Clear Water regions of Idaho there was a fair showing of big game, with a good sprinkling of the fur bearers, including a bunch of beaver here and there. (Beaver protected.) I heard men tell of there being plenty of grizzly and silver tip bear but I saw no signs of them. In California a trapper told, me of a large grizzly coming to his shack in the night. He said that he was cooking venison and that he had the fresh meat of a deer in the shack and he thought that the bear smelled the meat was what brought him there. The man said the bear smelled around the shack awhile and then began to dig at one corner of the shack and soon pulled out the bottom log. The man kept quiet until the bear pulled out the next log and put his head in through the hole when he put a ball between the bear's eyes that fixed Bruin too quick. (A bad case of nightmare.) I think it doubtful if there is a grizzly bear or at least very few now to be found south of the British Columbia line. My best catch of bear in one season with a partner was eleven. Years ago I caught from three to six bear each season but late years I have not caught more than one to three. I think that of late the heavy lumbering going on through Northern Pennsylvania had something to do with the catch of bear. The timber in Pennsylvania is largely cut away now leaving bark slashings which make fine shelter for bear and wildcats and both animals were apparently quite plenty I would judge from the number caught in this section, fall of 1907. Deer are very scarce in this state, perhaps the most to be found are in Pike County. I can lay claim to one thing that but few hunters and trappers can do, that is for forty years I lost only two seasons from the trap line and the trail and each time I was detained by rheumatism. Once being taken down with sciatica while in the camp trapping and hunting, and it held me to my bed for several months hard and tight. I still have the greater part of my trapping and hunting outfit, and am still in hopes to be able to get out on the line and pinch a few more toes. CHAPTER II. Early Experiences. As I promised to write something of my early experience at trapping and hunting, I will begin by saying that I am now living within one mile of where I was born sixty years ago (this was written in 1904), and that I began my trapping career by first trapping rats in my father's grist mill with the old figure four squat trap. I well remember the many war dances that I had when I could not make the trap stay set; but I did not trap long inside the mill for father also ran a blacksmith shop and always kept a good man to do the work in the shop. I was soon coaxing the smith to make me a steel trap, which he did. I now began catching muskrats along the tail race and about the mill dam, but the spring on my trap was so stiff that when I found the trap sprung or found game in it, I was obliged to bring the trap to the house and have some one older than I to set it. Then I would carry it back to the creek and set it. Well this was slow work and I was continually begging the blacksmith to make me more traps with weaker springs so I could set them myself. After much coaxing he made me three more which I was able to set and then the muskrats began to suffer. Let me say at that time a muskrat skin was worth more than a mink skin. Boys, I was like a man in public office, the more of it they have, the more they want. So it was with me in regard to the traps, but I could not coax the blacksmith to make any more. An older brother came to my aid in this way: he told me to go to town and see the blacksmith there and see if I could not sell some charcoal to him for traps, and he, (my brother) would help me burn the coal. Now this burning the coal was done by gathering hemlock knots from old rotten logs and piling them up and covering them like potato holes, leaving a hole open at the bottom to start the fire. After the fire was well started the hole was closed and the knots smoldered for several days. Well, the plan worked and by the operation I became the possessor of five more traps. By this time the vicinity of the mill dam and race was no longer large enough to furnish trapping grounds, and I ventured farther up and down the stream and took in the coon and mink along with the muskrat. [Illustration: WOODCOCK, WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW, RESIDENCE AND HIS DOG MACK.] We had a neighbor, Washburn by name, who was considered a great trapper, for he could now and then catch a fox. As time passed by, I began to have a great desire to get on an equal with Mr. Washburn and catch a fox. I began to urge him to allow me to go with him to see how he set his trap, and after a long time coaxing, he granted my request. I found what everyone of today knows of the chaff bed set. You may now know that it was not long before I had a bed made near a barn that stood well back in the field, and after much worry and many wakeful nights I caught a fox and I thought myself Lord Jonathan. As time went by, and by chance I learned that by mixing a goodly part of hen manure with plenty of feathers in it, and mixing it with the chaff, it was a great improvement on chaff alone. Next I learned of the well known water set. However, I perhaps set different from the most of trappers in making this set. Well as all trappers learn from long years of experience, so have I, and those old-fashioned sets are like the squat traps, not up-to-date. I will now drop the trapping question for a time and tell you how I killed my first deer. Just outside of the clearing on father's farm and not more than fifty rods from the house was a wet place, such as are known to these parts as a ""bear wallow."" This wet place had been salted and was what is called a ""salt lick."" In those days it was not an uncommon thing to see six or eight deer in the field any morning during the summer season--the same as you will see them in parts of California today. It was not an uncommon thing for my older brother to kill a deer at this lick any morning or evening, but that was not making a nimrod of me. I would beg father to let me take the gun (which was an old double barreled flintlock shot gun) and watch the lick. As I was only nine years old, they would not allow me to have the gun, so I was obliged to steal it out when no one was in sight, carry it to the barn and then watch my opportunity and ""skipper"" from the barn to the lick. All worked smoothly and I got to the lick all right. It was toward sundown and I had scarcely poked the gun through the hole in the blind and looked out when I saw two or three deer coming toward the lick. I cocked the old gun and made ready but about this time I was taken with the worst chill that any boy ever had and I shook so that I could scarcely hold the gun to the peep hole. It was only a moment when two of the deer stepped into the lick, and I took the best aim I could under the condition, and pulled the trigger. Well of all the bawling a deer ever made, I think this one did the worst, but I did not stop to see what I had done but took across the field to the house at a lively gait, leaving the gun in the blind. The folks heard the shot and saw me running for the house at break-neck speed (this of course was the first that they knew I was out with the gun). My older brother came to meet me and see what the trouble was. When I told him what I had done, he went with me to the lick and there we found a fair-sized buck wallowing in the lick with his back broken, one buck shot (or rather one slug, for the gun was loaded with pieces cut from a bar of lead); one slug had struck and broken the spine and this was the cause of the deer bawling so loud as this was the only one that hit. The old shotgun was now taken from its usual corner in the kitchen and hung up over the mantle piece above the big fire place and well out of my reach. This did not stop my hunting. We had a neighbor who had two or three guns and he would lend me one of them. I would hide away hen eggs and take them to the grocery and trade them for powder and shot. Of course the man who owned the gun got the game, when I chanced to kill any, for I did not dare to carry it home. It was not long until father found that I was borrowing Mr. Abbott's gun, and he thought that if hunt I would, it would be better that I use our own and then he would know when I was out with it. He took the old flintlock to the gunsmith and had it fixed over into a cap lock, and now I was rigged out with both gun and traps. I will now tell you about the first bear that I killed. I was about thirteen years old, and it was not so common a thing for one to kill a bear in those days as it is now (1904), for strange as it may seem, bears are far more plentiful here today than they were at that time. Two of my brothers and three or four of the neighbors went into the woods about twelve miles and bought fifty acres of land. There was no one living within six or seven miles of the place. They cleared off four or five acres and built a good log fence around it. They also built a small barn and cabin. Each spring they would drive their young cattle out to this place, stay a few days and plant a few potatoes, and some corn. About once a month it was customary to go over to this clearing and hunt up the cattle and bring them to the clearing and salt them, then have a day or two of trout fishing, watch licks and kill a deer or two, jerk the meat and have a general good time. I was allowed to go on one of these expeditions, and the first night the men watched one or two licks and one of the men killed a deer, but I had to stay in camp that night with a promise that I should watch the second night. During the first night we heard wolves howl away upon the hills. The next morning the men talked very mysteriously about the wolves and said that it would not be safe to watch the licks that night, that no deer would come to the licks as long as the wolves were around. I took it all in and said nothing, but was determined to watch a lick that night. Finally one of the men, John Duell by name, said that I could watch the lick that he had and he would stay in camp. The one that I was to watch was only a short distance from the clearing. When the sun was about one-half hour high, I took the old shot gun, this time loaded with genuine buck shot and climbed the Indian ladder to the scaffold which was built about twenty feet from the ground in a hemlock tree. I sat quiet until sundown and no deer came. I thought I would tie the gun in the notches in the limbs, which brought the gun in proper range to kill the deer in the lick, should it come after dark. I got one string tied around the barrel and the limb when a slight noise to my left caused me to look in that direction and I saw a dark object standing in the edge of the little thicket, which I took to be a black creature I had seen down near the clearing when I came to the lick. My thoughts were that I would tie the breech of the gun fast to the limb, and then I would climb down and stone the animal away, so I went on tying the gun fast. On looking up I saw that the supposedly black heifer had turned out to be a black bear, and that it was going to go above the lick and not into it. My knife was out in an instant and the next moment I had the strings that held the gun cut. I raised it carefully to my face and about this time the bear stopped, turned his head around and looked back in the direction he had come. This was my chance, and I fired both barrels at his head and shoulders, and immediately there was a snorting, snarling, rolling and tumbling of the bear, but the maneuvers of the bear was no comparison to the screams and shouts that came from me. I was still making more noise than a band of Indians when Mr. Duell arrived on the scene and took in the situation. The other men who were watching other licks thought I had surely been attacked by the wolves by the unearthly yell I was making and the whole party were soon on the ground. The bear was soon dressed and the men gave me the cognomen of the ""The Great Hunter of Kentucky"" and so ended the killing of my first bear. I am still in hopes to take the pelts from one or two this fall and winter and later, I will tell of some of the incidents I have seen and experienced while trapping and hunting among them. Perhaps, how a brother of mine got a tenderfoot to ride the carcass of a deer down a steep and hard frozen mountain when there was about two inches of snow on would be interesting. CHAPTER III. My First Real Trapping Experience. When I was about eighteen, I received a letter from a man by the name of Harris, who lived in Steuben County, New York, wherein he stated that a Mr. Lathrop had suggested me as a suitable party to go with him to the region known as Black Forest. This section extends through four counties, the southern part of Potter and Tioga counties, and northern part of Clinton and Lycoming counties, Pa. Every reader knows or has heard of the Black Forest region. This section was and is still (1910) known as a good bear country. I thought it strange that Mr. Lathrop, a man of much note as a hunter, would recommend me, merely a boy, to go with Mr. Harris and into a region like the Black Forest. As Mr. Lathrop lived about four miles from our place I lost no time in going there to learn who this Mr. Harris was. I was informed that he was an old hunter and trapper about eighty years old and that he wanted a partner more for a companion than a hunter or trapper. Mr. Lathrop had met Mr. Harris while on a fishing tour on the Sinnamahoning waters during the summer and said that he knew nothing of Mr. Harris otherwise than what he saw of him at this meeting and to all appearances he was a fine old gentleman. I showed the letter to father and asked what I should do about it and he replied that he thought I could spend my time to a better advantage in school, but he did not say that I could not go with Mr. Harris. I therefore wrote him that I would be ready at the time mentioned which was the twentieth of October. Mr. Goodsil, the gunsmith in town, had been at work for some time on a new gun for me. Now that I was going into the woods to hunt in earnest, I was at the gun shop nearly every day, urging Mr. Goodsil to finish my gun which he did and in plenty of time. After I got my gun the days seemed like weeks and the weeks like months. I was constantly in fear that Mr. Harris would not come. But promptly at the time set, in the evening just before sundown, a man with a one horse wagon loaded with bear traps and other traps of smaller size and with one of the worst old rack-of-bones of a horse that I had ever seen, drove up to father's place, stopped and inquired if Mr. Woodcock lived there. I immediately asked if he was Mr. Harris, as I had already guessed who the man was. He replied that he was and said that he took it that I was the lad who was going with him. Mr. Harris said that ""often an old horse and a colt"" worked well together and that we would make a good team. While we were putting his horses away I asked him what he intended to do with the old horse and he replied that he brought him along so that if we got stuck he could hitch him on and help out. The other horse was a fine horse and I was at a loss to know what Mr. Harris meant. During the evening I thought father and Mr. Harris talked on every other subject rather than hunting but I managed to put in a few questions now and again as to what we were to do when we arrived at the great Black Forest. Mr. Harris was a tall, broad-shouldered man with a long beard nearly as white as snow. We were up early the next morning and on our way before daylight. Our route was over the road known as the Jersey Shore turnpike but after the first four miles we went through an unbroken wilderness for twenty miles, save only one house, then known as the Edcomb Place, now called Cherry Springs. The next place, ten miles farther on, was a group of four or five shacks called Carter Camp, but known now as Newbergen. This was in the year 1863 and the conditions over this road are the same today only the large timber has been mostly cut away and there is no one living at Cherry Springs. Five miles farther on we came to Oleana, where there was a hotel and store, owned by Henry Anderson, a Norwegian, who came to this country as the private secretary of Ole Bull, the great violinist, and it was here where the much talked of Ole Bull Castle was built. Beg pardon, I guess I am getting off the trap line. We stopped at the hotel for the night and the next morning purchased supplies sufficient to last during the entire campaign, consisting of lard, pork, flour, corn meal, tea, coffee, rice, beans, sugar and the necessary salt, pepper, etc. I remember well when Mr. Harris ordered fifty pounds of beans and asked me if I thought that would do? I replied that I thought it would. In my mind I wondered what we would do with all those beans. But now I wish to say to the man going into camp on a long hunting and trapping campaign, don't forget the beans as they are bread and meat. We are now within about ten or twelve miles of where we intended to camp, which was at the junction of the Bailey and Nebo Branches of Young Woman's Creek. It was about the middle of the afternoon of the second day we were out and Mr. Harris said that here would be a good place to build the camp. We got the horses out as soon as we could and Mr. Harris picked out a large rock; one side had a straight, smooth side and was high and broad enough for one end of the shanty and there was a fine spring close by. Mr. Harris pointed to the rock and said that there we had one end of our camp already as well as a good start towards the fire place. He told me to begin the cutting of logs for the other two sides and the other end. We cut the logs a suitable size to handle well and about twelve and fourteen feet long. Mr. Harris did the planning while I did the heavy part of the work. That night we slept under a hemlock tree and were up the next morning and had breakfast before daylight and ready for the day's work. We could see scuds of clouds away off in the southwest which Mr. Harris said did not show well for us. He had brought a good crosscut saw and it was not long until we had logs enough cut to put up the sides, about four feet high and logs for one end. We hauled the logs all up with the horse so they would be handy. Then we began the work of notching and putting up the logs. About noon a drizzling rain started and kept it up all the afternoon. We covered our provisions and blankets the best we could to keep them dry and continued to work on the camp. We got the body up, the rafters and a part of the roof on. We put up a ridge roof as Mr. Harris said it would not be necessary to have the sides quite so high with a steep ridge roof. We got our supplies under shelter and had a dry place to sleep that night. It was still raining in the morning but we continued to work on the camp like beavers all day and we got shakes split from a pine stub to finish the roof and chinking blocks to chink between the logs. The next morning Mr. Harris said that he would go and take the horse out to a farm house that was about six miles out the turnpike, known as the Widow Herod Place, or better known as Aunt Bettie. Mr. Harris said he would go while there was food enough to last the old horse a day or two until we were ready to use him. Then I knew that the old horse was doomed to be used for bear bait. When Mr. Harris started away with the horse he cautioned me not to go off hunting, but to stick to work on the shanty which I did like a ""nailer."" When Mr. Harris returned I had the roof on, the chinking all in and the gable end boarded up with shakes and all ready to begin calking and mudding. It was some time in the afternoon when he got back and after looking over the shack to see what I had done he said that he thought I had done so well that I was entitled to a play spell and suggested that we take our guns and go down along the side of the hill and see if we could kill a deer, remarking that we could use a little venison if we had it. He told me to go up onto the bench near the top of the hill while he would take the lower bench and he would hunt the side hill along down the stream until dark. Mr. Harris had a single barrel gun with a barrel three or four feet long which he called Sudden Death, and it weighed twelve or fourteen pounds. As for me I had my new double barrel gun which I have mentioned before. We had not gone far until I heard the report of a gun below me and soon I heard Mr. Harris ""ho-ho-hoa,"" and I hurried to where the howling came from and found him already taking the entrails out of a small doe. I suggested to Mr. Harris that we take the deer down to the creek before we dressed it and that by so doing we probably could catch a mink or coon with the entrails. He consented to do so and after we had taken out the entrails Mr. Harris noticed a fine place to catch a fox or some other animal and pointed to a large tree that had fallen across the stream. The tree had broken in two at the bank, on the side of the stream where we were. The water had swung the trunk of the tree down the stream until there was a space of three or four feet between the end of the tree and the bank. Mr. Harris took a part of the offal from the deer and carried it across to the opposite bank and placed the remainder on the side where we were. He then placed an old limb for a drag to the trap at the place where he wanted to set the trap. As we had no traps with us we went to camp and early the next morning we took two traps and went to this place and set them. We put in that day finishing the camp, putting in the door and fixing the chimney to the fireplace and calking all the cracks between the logs and mudded tight between the logs and all the joints. Now the camp being completed we began setting the bear traps. The old horse was taken onto a chestnut ridge and shot, cut up into small pieces suitable for bear bait, and hung up in small saplings such as we could bend down. After the bait was fastened to the tree we let it spring up so as to keep it out of the reach of any animal until we had a trap set. The way Mr. Harris set a bear trap was to build a V shaped pen about three feet long and about the same in height, place the bait in the back end of the pen and set the trap in the entrance. We had eleven bear traps and after they were all set on different ridges where bears were most likely to travel, we began the work of setting the small traps which was not a long job, as we had only about forty. The next morning Mr. Harris said that I had better go down and see if the traps we had set had been disturbed and he said that he would rest while I was gone. When I came in sight of the traps I could see a fox bounding around in one of the traps. I could see on looking at the trap we had placed across the creek that the drag had been moved closer to the log but I could see nothing moving. I cut a stick and killed the fox when I crossed over to see what was in the other trap and to my disgust there was a skunk. I was not particularly in love with skunks in those days, for while they scented just as loud at that time as now they were vastly lacking in the money value. I took hold of the clog and carefully dragged the skunk to the creek and sank him in the water. I now went back to the other side of the creek and set the fox trap and when I had the trap set the skunk was good and dead. I reset the trap and took the fox and skunk to camp without skinning. When I got to camp I found Mr. Harris busy making stretching boards of different sizes for different animals from shakes that we had left when covering the roof. Mr. Harris laughed and said that he knew that we would need them when I got back. The fox and skunk were skinned, stretched and hung up on the outside of the gable of the shack, and that was the starting point of our catch of the season. We set the most of our small traps along the streams for foxes and mink, taking a few to the ridges to set in likely places to catch a fox, and at thick laurel patches where we were likely to catch a wild cat as there was a bounty of $2 on them. After the small steel traps were set we began building a line of deadfalls for marten and fisher. After the deadfalls were built we divided our time between hunting deer and tending the traps. We caught three bears, two fisher, which were very scarce, as I do not think that fishers were ever very plentiful in this state, a good bunch of marten, foxes, four or five wildcats and killed twenty-two deer. The last days of December Mr. Harris said that we would prepare to go home as the deer season closed the first of January. Although the law gave until the fifteenth to get your deer we had dragged the most of ours up to the Bailey Mill at various times. We got all those around the mill and sent them to Jersey Shore by freight teams to the railroad, then shipped them to New York. We got 15 cents for saddles and 10 cents for the whole deer. Mr. Harris had brought an auger with him so that he could make a sleigh to go home with and from birch saplings we made one and on the thirteenth of January I went and got the horse. He was as fat as a pig and felt like a colt. We hitched him up to the sleigh and got our stuff up to the Bailey Mill where we loaded the wagon onto the sleigh and piled on the furs and the rest of our outfit and early on the morning of the fourteenth we started for home. This ended my first real experience as a hunter and trapper. I received two or three letters from Mr. Harris, the last one in which he stated that he was not feeling very well and I never heard from him again. CHAPTER IV. Some Early Experiences. In 1871 or 1872 I had several bear traps made by our local blacksmith and I started in as a bear trapper and went it alone. After being out with Mr. Harris I had taken some valuable lessons on trapping bear and other animals. I built a good log camp on the West Branch of Pine Creek and went to trapping and hunting without either partner or companion, but after being in camp the first season I bought a shepherd dog that was a year old and broke him for still hunting and trapping. I found that a good intelligent dog was not only a companion but also a valuable one. I have noticed that some trappers do not want a dog on the trap line with them, claiming that the dog is a nuisance. This is because the dog was not properly trained. To get back to the bear trapping: In the locality where I was trapping, bear were not very plentiful except in season, when there was a crop of beechnuts, although there was but little other shack, such as chestnuts and acorns. However, some seasons there would be an abundance of black cherries which the bears are very fond of. I set three traps at the head of a broad basin where there were three or four springs and the next day I set the balance of my bear traps; then I built a few deadfalls for coons and set a few steel traps for fox. As I had seen several fresh bear tracks crossing the stream, where I had been setting the coon traps, on the morning of the third day after I had set the first three bear traps, I thought that I would go and look after them. They were about a mile and a half from camp and when I came in sight of the first trap I saw that I had a bear. You may be sure that I again felt like a mighty hunter. I was more pleased over this one bear than I was over the eight bear we had caught when I was with Mr. Harris, because now I was the trapper and not Mr. Harris. The bear was a good sized female. She had become fast only a short distance from where the trap was set. I shot and skinned the bear then cut the carcass into quarters, bent down a sapling and hung a quarter of the bear on this. With a forked pole I raised the sapling up until the meat was out of the way of small animals that might happen along. After hanging up three of the quarters in this manner, leaving one to take to camp, I took the lungs and liver and put them in the bait pen. The bait had all been eaten and I was quite sure it had been done after the bear was caught, as a bear immediately loses its appetite after placing its foot in a good, strong trap. I really expected to find another bear in one of the other traps as they were not far away, but the other traps were undisturbed. The next morning I thought I would take some bait from camp and bait the trap where I had put the offals from the bear, fearing that should a bear come along it might not eat the bait that was in the pen. You may imagine my surprise when I came in sight of the trap to see another bear fast in the trap. After killing the bear I removed the entrails and started to carry the bear to camp. It was a cub and I could carry it without cutting it in parts. I was just about to start for camp when I decided I would go to the other traps. If I was surprised at seeing the first cub, I was doubly so, for there was another cub tangled up in the trap. Do you think I felt gay? Well, that was no name for it. I shot this cub and without waiting to dress it I took a lively gait to the other trap to see if there were any more bears but there was nothing there. The last two bears, I think were the cubs of the old bear that I had caught the night before. I spent the entire day getting the bears to camp. I did not get any more bear for some time although I had an opportunity to learn a whole lot about them. Some days after I got the old bear and the cubs, I found the bait pen in one of the traps torn down by a bear, which had taken the bait and had not sprung the trap. Right here I will say that I learned a great deal more about the habits of Bruin. After finding the bait gone I thought that all I would have to do was to make the bait pen a little stronger so Bruin could not tear it down so readily to get at the bait. I did not think that a bear knew anything about ""trapology,"" for the experience I had so far in bear trapping was that bears knew but little more about a trap than a hog, though later I found I was very much mistaken. [Illustration: SETTING A LARGE STEEL TRAP FOR BEAR.] The trap was set in a small brook where there were plenty of rocks of all sizes. I rolled several of these rocks, as large as I could handle, up about the bait pen to strengthen it to such an extent that Bruin would not think of tearing it down. I figured the bear by going over the trap would take the bait from the entrance of the pen as a good bear should; though in this I was greatly mistaken. The second day I went to the trap with full expectation of finding Bruin fast in the trap, but again I was disappointed--Bruin had again gone to the back of the pen and torn the top of the pen off, rolling away some of the stones, taking the bait. Now I saw that if I was to get my friend Bruin, I would have to work a little strategy. I removed the trap from the clog, leaving the clog undisturbed and making all appear just the same as it did when the trap was set. I was very careful to have the covering of the trap left just the same as when the trap was set. Then I got another clog and set the trap at the back of the pen at the place where the bear had torn off the top of the bait pen. Here I concealed the trap and clog as completely as I knew how and being very careful to make all appear just as before the trap was set, flattering myself that Bruin would surely put his foot in it this time. I went early the next morning, being sure that I would find Bruin, but no bear had been there. I went again early the next morning with high expectations of finding Bruin waiting for me, but again nothing had been disturbed. Thinking that Bruin had left that locality altogether, or that he would not be back again for several days, I thought I would go and have a team come and take out the furs and game I had, and give Bruin time to get back after more bait. As I had caught no bear at the other traps, I felt quite certain that Bruin was still somewhere in the neighborhood and would be around again after more bait. When I reached home an old gentleman by the name of Nelson who was a noted hunter and trapper and who lived near us, came to see me. Let me explain who this Mr. Nelson was, as I shall have more to say of him. Mr. Nelson was one of the early settlers in this county, moving here at an early date from Washington County, New York State. He was known here as Uncle Horatio and by many as Squire Nelson, as he was a Justice of the Peace here for thirty years. Mr. Nelson would always come to our house as soon as he found that I was at home, to see what luck I had in the way of trapping and hunting. On this occasion, Mr. Nelson, or Uncle Horatio, as we always called him, was soon over to learn what luck I had and when I told him what sort of a time I had trying to outwit the bear, he said I had better build a deadfall and let the bear kill himself. Uncle said that Bruin would give me much trouble and was likely to leave and I would not get him at all. This idea I did not like, for I had, before this, been put to my wit's end to outwit a cunning old fox, but finally succeeded in catching him and I thought I could outwit such a dumb thing as a bear. I thought if I could not get the bear in a steel trap, there would be but little use trying to get him in such a clumsy thing as a deadfall--however, Uncle had trapped bear long before I was born and knew what he was talking about. As soon as I got back to camp I went to the bear trap to relieve Bruin of his troubles, but it was not the bear that was in trouble, but myself, for Bruin had been there and torn out a stone at one side of the pen and had taken the bait. Well, the case was getting desperate, so I got another trap and set it at the side where the bear took the bait the last time, taking all the pains possible in setting the trap, but the result was no better than before. I had made it a habit to hang on a small bait near the bear traps, believing that the bear would be attracted by the scent of the bait hanging up from the ground more than it would from the bait in the pen. At this trap I had hung up the bait in a bush that extended out from the bank over the brook and each time the bear had taken this bait. I now took one of the traps at the pen, leaving the clog and all appearances as though the trap still remained there. Getting another clog I concealed it under the edge of the bank and set the trap under the bait that I had hung in the bush. I was certain this time that I would outwit Bruin, but instead, the bear went onto the bank, pulled the bush around, took the bait and went about his business. Now I was getting pretty excited and began to think of the advice of Uncle Horatio but I was not willing to give up yet. Up the brook, fifty or sixty feet from the bait pen, there had fallen a small, bushy hemlock tree which stood on the right hand bank of the spring, and the top of the tree reached nearly over to the opposite bank. I had noticed that when the bear had come to the trap he had come down the brook and went back the same way. The water was shallow in the brook, barely covering the stones and fallen leaves all over the bed of the brook. Going to the top of the hemlock tree, I saw that the bear had passed between the top of this tree and the bank of the brook. Here was a fine place to conceal the trap and I said, ""Old fellow, here I will surely outwit you."" I took the trap from the bait pen and set it in the open space between the top of the tree and concealing all the very best I could, I again put more bait in the bait pen and hung up more on the bush. I waited two days and then went to the traps again, wondering all the way what the result would be. Well, it was the same as before. The bear had gone to the bush on the bank, taken the bait, and had also taken the bait from the bait pen as usual. Now I thought it quite time to try Uncle's plan, though I had but little faith in it. It was several miles to Mr. Haskins', the nearest house, but I lost no time in getting there for I was now feeling desperate. Mr. Haskins readily consented to help me build a deadfall. We cut a beech tree that was about fourteen inches through, that stood back in thick undergrowth some rods from the bait pen. We cut a portion about four feet long from the large end of the tree for the bed-piece and placing it against the small tree for one of the stakes. With levers we placed the tree on top of the bed-piece and with three other good stakes driven at each side of the logs fastened the tops of the stakes together with withes to strengthen them, we soon had a good, strong deadfall made, as every boy who is a reader of the H-T-T, knows how to build. We baited the trap and set it, getting done in time for Mr. Haskins to get home before dark. I again put bait back in the bait pen and on the bush as before and patiently awaited results. The second day I looked after the traps but there were no signs of bear being about either the deadfall or the steel traps and I feared that I had frightened Bruin out of the country in building the deadfall. I put in three or four days looking after other traps, thinking but little about the bear that had, so far, been beyond my skill. After three or four days, I again went to the deadfall, wondering and imagining all kinds of things. When I came to the steel traps the bait was still undisturbed and I was now sure that that particular bear was not for me, but when I stepped into the thicket so that I could see the deadfall, there was Bruin, good and dead. When I looked at the bear I found that he had three toes gone from one foot and this I thought to be the cause of his being so over-shy of the steel traps. I learned a lesson that has since served me more than one good turn. * * * In later years it was customary for many of my friends to come to my camp and spend a few days with me. It was of one of these occasions that I will relate. Two young men, named Benson and Hill, had sent me word that they were coming out to my camp and hunt a few days; also to go with me to my bear traps but added that they did not suppose that I would get a bear while they were in camp, even if they would stay all winter. It had been drizzling sort of a rain for several days and every old bear hunter knows that dark, lowery weather is the sort bears like to do their traveling in. I had set the time to go out on a stream known as the Sunken Branch, to look after some fox traps and also two bear traps that I had in that section the day I got word from Benson and Hill that they would be over to camp the next day. I thought I would put off going to look after the traps in that locality until the boys came over and should I have the luck to find a bear in one of the traps it would come very acceptable to have the help to get the bear to camp for it was some four or five miles to the farthest trap. The boys came as they said but the next morning after they got there it was raining very hard and they did not want to go out and did not want me to go until it slacked up. Well, the next morning it was raining hard and the boys were in no better mood to go out than the day before. It had been several days since I had been to the traps, in that direction, and there were some chestnuts in that locality where the bear traps were set. The storm had knocked the chestnuts out and it was probable that bears would be in that locality. I told the boys I did not like to let the traps go any longer without looking after them and they could stay in camp and I would go to the traps. When I was about ready to start, Hill said that he would go with me, notwithstanding the rain, though Benson tried to persuade us not to go, stating that no bear was fool enough to travel in such a rain and that all we would get would be a good thorough soaking. I was determined to delay no longer looking at the traps and started off when Hill said, ""Well, I'm with you."" So we took the nearest cut possible to reach the traps. Hill was continually wishing we would find a bear in one of the traps and that he could shoot it so that he could joke with Benson. Our route took us along the top of a ridge for about three miles when we dropped off to the first trap. When we were still half way up the side of the ridge I saw that Hill had got his wish for I could see a bear rolling and tumbling about down in the hollow and knew that it was fast in the trap. I tried to point it out to Hill but he could not get his eye on it, so we went farther down the hill when Jim (that was Hill's given name) could see the bear. He said there was no need of going closer, that he could shoot it from where we were, but I said we must go closer as I did not like to make holes in the body of the skin unnecessarily. We had only taken a few steps farther when Jim said we were plenty close, that he could, shoot it from where we were and that if we should go closer the bear might break out of the trap and escape. With all my urging I could not get Hill closer so I told him to be sure that he shot the bear in the head and not in the body. I discovered that Hill was very nervous and told him to take all the time necessary to make a sure shot. When the gun cracked I saw a twig fall that the gun had cut off fully three feet above the bear's head. I urged Hill a few yards closer when he tried again with no better results than the first shot. After making the third shot Hill said he guessed that I had better shoot the bear as he thought something had gone wrong with the sights on his gun. It was raining hard so I killed the bear and took the entrails out, set the trap again and left the bear lying on the ground. As it was a small bear we concluded to take the bear to camp whole. We hurried on to the next trap which was about a mile farther down the stream. When we got to where the trap was set it was gone, but the way things were torn up we could see that we had a bear this time that was no small one. The bear had worked down the stream, first climbing the hill on one side of the stream until it became entangled in a jam of brush or old logs, then back down the hill and up on the other side until it became discouraged, when it would try the other side again. The bear was continuously getting the clog fast under the roots of trees or against old logs when it would gnaw the brush and tear them out by the roots. It was also noticed where he would rake the bark on the trees in trying to climb them, in hopes of escaping the drag that was following him. The bear would gnaw and tear old logs to pieces whenever the clog became fast against them. This was all very interesting and exciting to Hill and he said he would give Benson the laugh when we got to camp. Hill had made me promise not to tell Benson how he had shot three times at the bear's head and missed it. The bear had worked his way down the stream nearly a mile from where the trap was set, when we came upon him and shot him at once. Hill declaring that it was getting too near night and raining too hard for him to practice on shooting bear any more that day. We skinned the bear, hung up the meat, took the trap and skin and went back up the creek and set the trap in the same place again. Taking the bear skin we started back to where we left the other bear. After carrying the whole bear and bear skin until it was dark, we hung the bear skin up in the crotch of a tree, taking the bear and hurrying to camp at as lively a gait as we were able to make. Hill said that while we had had a pretty rough day of it he would make it all up in getting the joke on Benson if I would not give him away on shooting the bears, as Hill was to tell Benson all about how he did it. Before we came to camp I said to Hill that if he cared to we would play a joke on Benson. He wished to know what the plan was. I said that we would fix the bear up in the path that led from the shack to the spring and get Benson to go after a pail of water and run onto the bear. So we planned to have Benson think that we got no bear and after supper was over I was to take the pail and start to the spring after a pail of fresh water when Hill was to interfere and insist that Benson should go for the water as he had been in camp all day and needed exercise. It was about a hundred feet from the shack to the spring and down quite a steep bank and about half way from the shack to the spring was a beech log across the path. When we got near camp we made no noise and when we came to the spring we washed our hands carefully to remove any blood that might be on them. Then we took the bear to the log that was across the path and placed the forepaws and shoulders up over the log leaving the hind parts on the ground, then with a small crotched stick placed under the bear's throat to hold up its head we had it fixed up to look as natural as we were able to in the dark. We went into the shack looking as downcast as a motherless colt. It was unnecessary to deny getting any bear for Benson told us almost before we were inside that we should have known that we would get no bear in any such weather as we were having and none but simpletons would have gone out in such rain. We ate our supper which Benson had waiting for us. We had little to say farther than to talk of what a fearful rain we were having. After supper was over I took the water pail, though it was nearly full of water, and threw the water out the door before Benson had time to object, saying that I would get a pail of fresh water. Hill said that we should let Benson go after the water as he had not been out of the shanty all day and needed some fresh air. Benson consented to go after another pail of water although he said that he had brought the water that we had thrown out just before we came. I told Benson that I would hold the light at the door so he could see but Benson replied that I need not bother, all that was necessary was to leave the door of the shack open so that he could see his way back. About the time that Benson reached the log he gave a terrible howl and we heard the water pail go rattling through the brush and when we got to the door Benson was coming on all fours, scrambling as fast as he could and yelling ""Bah--bah--bear--bear!"" Hill nor I could not keep from roaring with laughter, and finally Hill managed to say, ""Oh, you didn't see any bear."" Benson made no reply but was as white as a sheet and shook as though he had the ague. We could not conceal our feelings and when Benson found his speech he said, ""You think you are mighty cunning; if you got a bear why didn't you say so and not act like two dumb idiots."" We had laughed so hard that Benson caught on and the game was up. Well, after Benson was onto our joke, nothing would do but we must get the bear in and skin out the fore parts so we could have some bear meat cooked before we went to bed. Every time Hill awoke during the night he would burst out laughing while Benson would hurl a few cuss words at him. The next day we brought in the skin and saddles of the other bear, leaving the fore quarters for fox and marten bait. The rain now being about over with and the ground and leaves thoroughly soaked, it was a good time for still hunting deer, so we were all out early the next morning. We started out together and soon became separated and it so happened that I was the only one to get a deer during the day. When I got to camp I found Benson was not in yet, so I did not tell that I had killed a deer, but thought I would wait until Benson came in and see what luck he had. If he had not killed anything I would give him the hint and let him have the credit of killing the deer that I got as a sort of off-set on Hill on the bear hunt. I stayed outside gathering dry limbs for wood until I saw Benson coming and I planned to meet him before Hill got to talk to him. I learned that Benson had not killed anything, so I told him where I had killed the deer and that if he cared to he could claim the deer as his game. Benson was much pleased with the idea and as I had told him just where I had killed the deer it was easy for Benson to explain to Hill where the deer was shot. Hill did not believe that Benson had killed a deer and said he would not believe he (Benson) had killed one if he did not know that he had been alone and anyway he must see the deer before he would believe it. I took the first opportunity when Hill was out to tell Benson which way to go so that he would be sure to find the deer and the next morning the boys went out and brought in the deer while I went to look after some traps. The boys stayed a day or two longer and then went home declaring that they had had the best hunt of their lives. I will now tell of some of my hunting and trapping with Mr. Nelson and my first experience with a big cat. About 1860, when I was a mere chunk of a boy, a man by the name of Perry Holman was camping on the extreme headwaters of Pine Creek, hunting and trapping. Early one morning Mr. Holman came out of the woods after groceries and other necessaries. On his way out he saw where a small bear had crossed the road just at the top of the hill on the old Jersey Shore turnpike and about five miles from Mr. Nelson's place. Mr. Nelson at that time always kept one or two good bear dogs. Mr. Holman told Mr. Nelson of the bear's track and said that the bear had gone into a laurel patch on the west side of the road and that the track was very fresh. He thought if Mr. Nelson would take his dogs and go out that he could get the bear without much trouble as he believed the bear would still be in the laurels close to the road. Mr. Nelson told Mr. Holman to get his groceries while he would come to see if I would go along to look after the team while Mr. Nelson and Mr. Holman went into the laurels after the bear. Of course, I was ready for anything that had hunt in it. The sleighing was good and Mr. Nelson was soon ready, taking his dogs into the sleigh so that they would not break off on the track of a deer or some other animal. When we came to where Mr. Holman saw the bear or cub, Mr. Nelson, or Uncle as we always called him, said to Mr. Holman before he got out of the sleigh: ""Perry, that is no cub's track; that is a big cat and I think we will find him in the laurel patch."" Uncle told me to stay with the team and that they would not be gone long; that if the track led off he would come back to the sleigh and I could go back with the team and he would go to Mr. Holman's camp and stay over night and come home the next day. The dogs were anxious to take the trail, but Uncle held them in to the laurels. They had not been gone more than ten minutes when the dogs began to give tongue like mischief. I could see that the dogs were coming towards the road and in about a minute saw the biggest cat that I had ever seen at that time, shinning up a large tree that was not further than fifty yards from the sleigh. The dogs were soon at the tree barking their best and in a few minutes I heard the crack of a gun and the big cat seemed to fly out into the air. I could hear the cat go threshing down through the limbs on the trees and the dogs doubled their howling and I could hear the men laugh. I called to the men to see if they got the cat. Uncle told me to watch the horses and they would soon be there, and they were soon in sight dragging a large panther instead of either a cub or cat. Uncle drove down to where Holman's path left the road to go down to his camp and we then drove back home. Uncle was greatly pleased over Perry's cat hunt as Mr. Nelson called it. * * * In or about the year '67 or '68, Uncle Horatio Nelson, whom I have spoken of before, had for years been accustomed to going to Edgecomb Place, later known as Cherry Springs, to hunt and trap. Wolves were then more plentiful than foxes are at the present time. I will explain that Cherry Springs was simply a farm house built of logs. This house was located about half way through, or in the center of a dense forest of about twenty miles square. The Jersey Shore turnpike ran through this vast forest and the stage or any traveler going through this region were obliged to stop at this house to feed at noon, or to stop over night, this being the only house on the road. From where this house was located there was easy access to the waters of Pine Creek, which flowed east, to the waters of the Cross Fork of Kettle Creek, which flowed south and to the waters of the East Fork of the Sinnamahoning which flowed west. There was no one living on any of these streams for many miles. This was the point where Mr. Nelson, or Uncle, as I shall call him, hunted for many years. At the time I am writing of, it had been a noted place for many hunters to stop from all parts of the country. There were almost too many hunters stopping at Cherry Spring to suit Uncle as he was getting pretty well along in years and did not like so much company. I had been camping a greater part of the time for several seasons about five miles north of Cherry Springs and one day Uncle said, if I cared to, he would go on to Crossfork and build a cabin and we would hunt and trap, more particularly trap. This was satisfactory to me although I had a good camp where I was trapping and in a fairly good locality for game, but the Crossfork country was a little farther in the tall timber so I thought that the change might be a good thing. About the first of October we took a team, went into the woods and cut out a sort of a turkey trail from the wagon road down to Boon Road Hollow to the Hog's Back branch of the Crossfork, where we selected a sight for the camp. We felled a large hemlock tree and cut off four logs of suitable length to make the body of the camp about ten by twelve feet inside. We worked them around in shape fitting the two shorter logs in between the ends of the two longer logs; then placing rafters at about half pitch, put on the covering, chinked and calked all the cracks and built a chimney of stones, sticks and clay and put in a door. We were now ready for the trap line. We set the bear traps on different ridges where we thought would be the most likely places for bears to travel. Then we put out two lines of deadfalls for marten. We then took the different branches and spring runs, building more deadfalls for mink and coons, setting the greater part of our steel traps for foxes. After all the steel traps but three or four were set, Uncle said that if I would go down the creek and set the balance of the steel traps, he would go and look after the first of the bear traps that we had set. I set the steel traps for foxes and built one or two more deadfalls farther down the creek. I think that I found a mink and one coon in the deadfalls that we had set in that section. I got to camp about dark but Uncle had not come yet. I hustled supper to have it ready when he came, but when supper was ready I could neither see nor hear anything of him. After waiting some time I concluded to eat and then if he did not come I would go in the direction he had taken as I now suspected that he had gotten a bear and was bringing in what he could carry and that I would meet him and help him in with his load. Before I started out to see if I could find him I gave several long and loud ""coohoopes,"" but got no answer. I concluded I would fire a couple of gunshots and see if I could get an answer, but got no reply save the hoot of an owl. I now began to feel alarmed, fearing that some misfortune had happened Uncle as he knew every rod of the ground in that section. I had no lantern so I made two good torches from fat pine, having a good supply in camp, and followed the stream until I came to a little draw where we had a bear trap set. This trap had not been disturbed, so I climbed the hill to the top of the ridge when I fired two more gunshots but still got no response. I was now thoroughly alarmed as I knew that a gunshot on the still night air could be heard a long ways from the high ridge I was on. With the aid of another torch I hurried on to the next bear trap and upon arriving at the second trap I saw that the clog was gone and that there was a trail leading off through the leaves and undergrowth. I now knew that it was something in connection with the bear that was detaining Uncle, but what it was I could not tell. I followed the trail with the aid of the torch for fifty yards when I came to a fallen tree that lay up about a foot from the ground. Here I found the clog that had been fastened to the trap. I could see that the trap ring had been moved from the clog by the aid of a hatchet. I searched about but could find no signs of the trap nor of the bear and I could no longer follow the trail by the aid of the torch, the last one being now pretty well burned out. There was nothing for me to do but go back to camp and wait until morning. When I was within a mile or less of camp, I heard the report of a gun in the direction of camp and knew that Uncle had arrived and was firing his gun to let me know that he was in camp. I answered the call by firing my gun and hurried on to camp to see what had detained him. The bear had gone over the fallen tree while the end of the clog had caught under the log and a weak link in the trap chain had given away, Bruin going off with the trap. Uncle had followed the bear several miles when dark came on. He followed down the stream to where it came in to the branch that the camp was on, and being over a ridge and so far from the camp was the cause of him not hearing the gunshots that I had fired. Uncle followed the bear until dark so as to know about where he was in case a snow should fall to fill up the trail. It was after midnight when we turned in but we were up in good season the next morning and taking a lunch in our knapsacks and each a blanket, we started for the wind jam to see if we could find the bear. Uncle took me to the bear's trail at the edge of the wind jam where I waited, giving him time to get around on the opposite side of the jam, at a point, where the bear was likely to come out, provided I should start him. I had not followed the trail far into the jam before I came to where the bear had made a bed by breaking down briers and gnawing down saplings, but he did not stay long at this place when he again went on. I soon came to another such bed and after finding several more, came to one that was fresher than the others. I could see that the bed had been made during the night. I now began to work my way along the trail very cautiously with my gun in hand ready for action and my heart in my mouth for I knew that Bruin would soon be on the move. I worked my way through the jam at a snail's pace and soon heard the rattle of the trap and could see the brush move not more than a hundred feet away. The undergrowth was so thick that I could get no distinct sight of the bear but fired a shot more to let Uncle know that Bruin was on the move than of any expectation of hitting him. When the gun cracked the bear gave a snort like that of a frightened hog and I could hear him tearing through the brush at a great rate. It was not long until I heard Uncle shoot and in the course of two or three minutes I heard him shoot again and knew that Bruin had given up the trap. After I had gone along the trail quite a ways, I saw a few drops of blood now and then and when I reached Uncle he was already skinning the bear. We found three holes in the bear. Uncle's second shot which was the finishing shot, hit the bear in the head. The shot that I fired caught Bruin just forward of the hips and undoubtedly would have killed him in time. We skinned the bear and took the hind quarters, the skin and trap and started for camp. I must say that I think this was the hardest stunt of packing that I remember and every old trapper knows what sort of a job of toting he often runs up against. We went down the run about two miles before coming to the stream that our camp was on, and then we had to go up this stream about four miles to camp. When we reached the stream it was dark; there was no path and there was a great deal of fallen timber and undergrowth along the creek, the creek winding around from one side of the valley to the other. It was a continual fording of the creek, climbing over fallen timber, through undergrowth and what not. You know no one but a trapper would be silly enough to do such a stunt in the dark. We arrived at camp about 9 o'clock, wet, tired and hungry. The next morning Uncle was still a little sore but I was as good as new and ready for another job of the same kind. Some days later we had a fall of snow of several inches and the second or third day after the snow came we heard a number of gunshots south of the camp on the ridge in the direction that we had a bear trap set. It was near sundown and as we were not aware that there was anyone camping or living in the direction of the gunshots, we concluded it was hunters shooting at deer. The shots were at such long intervals that Uncle said he did not think it was anyone shooting at deer and that the shots sounded like they were right where we had a bear trap set and that he thought hunters had run onto a bear in our trap and were shooting at it. It was then too late to go to the trap. Uncle said we would get up early in the morning for he was sure the gunshots were close in the neighborhood in which our trap was set, and he thought it likely that we had a bear in the trap. We were on the way before it was fairly daylight but when we came to the place where the trap had been set we found it gone. We followed the trail a short distance when the tracks of three men came onto the trail. The men had stamped and tracked about where they came onto the trail as though they were holding a council and then all started off on the trail of the bear. They did not go far before they came up with the bear where the trap clog had become fast between two saplings. The trap was nowhere to be seen. The men had made many tracks where they killed the bear. Uncle said it looked as though the men intended to steal the bear trap and all. We saw where the track of a man led off towards a large log and returned. Uncle told me to follow that man's tracks and see what he went out there for, as probably he hid the trap behind the log. I found the trap clog behind the log but there was no trap. It was snowing some at the time the men killed the bear. When we found that the men had taken the trap and hid the trap clog Uncle exclaimed, ""The varmints intend to steal our bear."" We followed the trail of the men as fast as we could for we were quite sure they must have stopped over night not far from there for it was nearly dark when they killed the bear. Their trail led down the hillside to the main stream, then down the creek and we hustled after them as fast as we could go. After going down the creek a mile or more we saw a smoke and Uncle said, ""There the varmints are,"" and he was right. We were none too soon as the men were already hitching the horses to the sleigh ready to start off. We could see that the bear was already on the sleigh, although it was covered over with a blanket. The men started at us but did not say a word. Uncle walked up to the end of the sleigh, caught a corner of the blanket, threw it back and uncovered the bear. Then taking the bear by the foreleg he gave it a flop onto the ground saying, ""You have a bear, haven't you,"" and the bear rolled to the ground and uncovered the trap; Uncle said, ""You have a trap, too, haven't you."" Not a word did any of the men say and when Uncle asked them who they were and where they lived, one of them said that they did not intend to steal the bear but were going to take it to the first house and leave it for us. Uncle told them that we did not care to have the bear go in that direction and told the men they must take the bear to our camp and their intentions were to steal the bear and trap and that they had better settle the matter at once. The men were ready to settle and asked what it would cost and Uncle told them if they would take the bear to our camp and then leave the woods and not be caught in that section again, that he would let them go. This they readily consented to do and insisted that we take a part of a cheese they had brought in with them. Uncle told them that we did not care for their cheese or anything else they had--all that we wanted was that they take the bear to our camp and get out of the woods. This they did and one of them also took the cheese along and left it at the camp. Then they left, begging that we would not say anything farther about the matter. We learned that the men did not live down the creek but instead lived in New York State. They had come for a few days' deer hunting and had only made a shelter of hemlock boughs. The first day out they ran across the bear and as it was snowing they thought it would snow enough to cover up their tracks and they would take the bear and get back to New York State. Well, they did get back but it happened they left the bear behind. I would like to ask the old liners who have grown too old on the trail and trap line to follow it longer with profit and pleasure, if they keep bees? I find it a great pleasure to watch these little, industrious and intelligent fellows work. CHAPTER V. Some Early Experiences (Concluded.) I will state that I began my career as a trapper and hunter at a very early age. The woods extended to the very door of my father's house and deer were more numerous than sheep in the fields at the present day. Bear were also quite plentiful and wolves were to be found in considerable numbers in certain localities. Panthers were much talked of and occasionally one would be killed by some hunter or trapper of which I will speak later. It was not long before I found my way further up the stream into the woods where mink and coon tracks were in real paths, and here was where father taught me how to make the deadfall, which was the trap principally used in those days. The guns that father had were one double barrel shotgun and a single barrel rifle, both flintlocks, and with much anxiety I watched those guns and begged of the older members of the family to let me shoot the gun but mother was ever on the watch to see that I was not allowed to handle the guns. About this time a man moved into the place by the name of Abbott from Schuylkill County, Pa., who brought two guns with him, a double barrel shotgun and a double barrel rifle. After doing some hard begging Mr. Abbott said that I could take the shotgun but that he could not furnish the ammunition. I later thought that Mr. Abbott thought that the problem of getting ammunition would put me up the tree. But again the will was good and I soon found a way. I began to watch the hen's nests pretty close and hide away the eggs and mother began to complain that the hens were not laying as many eggs as usual. Well, three dozen of eggs would get a pound of shot, a fourth of a pound of powder and a box of G. D. gun caps. I had some fine times out with the gun and I always gave Mr. Abbott whatever game I killed. I did not dare to take it home fearing that I would be compelled to explain how I came by the game. One day I had been out after wild pigeons and had got quite a number or more than I liked to give away and go without ourselves. I thought I would resort to one of those white lies that we have all heard tell of. I told my parents that Mr. Abbott gave me the pigeons but the plan did not work, although it was the making of me so far as a gun is concerned. When father inquired of Mr. Abbott as to how I got the pigeons it brought out the whole thing as to the gun business and also why the egg basket had not filled up as usual. The result was that father and mother held a council of war and decided that if I was to have a gun the better way was to let me have one of my own. Father told me that I must not borrow a gun any more but take one of our own guns and that he (father) would take the gun to the gunsmith and have the locks changed from a flint lock to a cap lock. You may be sure that this was the best news that this kid ever heard. I picked up double the usual stone piles that day and went and got the cows without being told a half dozen times. Well, as every hunter and trapper who is born and not made is always looking for taller timber and trying to get farther and farther from the ting-tong of the cow bells, so it was in my case. I had seen some whelp wolves that friends of ours (Harris and Leroy Lyman, who were noted hunters) had got. They had gone onto the waters of the Sinnemahoning and taken five pup wolves not much larger than kittens, from their den. The puppies were brought out alive but they killed the old mother wolf. On their way home they stopped at our house so that we could see the young wolves. I heard these hunters tell how they discovered the wolf den; how they had howled in imitation of a wolf to call the old wolves up; how they had shot the old female and had then taken the young wolves from the den; heard them tell of the money that the bounty on wolves would bring them (there was $25 bounty on all wolves then, the same as now). All of this made me long for the day when I would be old enough to do as these noted hunters had done. I had already found a den of young foxes and had kept five of them alive, which father finally killed all but one because he said they were a nuisance. I had seen some Indians bring a live elk in with ropes, dogs and horses, which they had roped in, after the dogs had brought it to bay, on a large rock on Tombs Run (Waters of Pine Creek). All this made me hungry for the day that I too could hit the trail and trap line that I might get some of those wolves and with the bounty money buy traps and guns to my satisfaction. A number of persons at our place (Lymansville) had gone several miles into the woods to the headwaters of the Sinnamahoning and taken up fifty acres of land. An acre or two was cleared off and the timber from this clearing was drawn and put in an immense pile to be used for the camp fire. The camp was simply a shed or leanto, open on one side, and in front of this shed the fire was built of beech and maple logs. Brook trout and game of all kinds were in abundance. Two or three times during the summer a party of six or eight persons would go out to this clearing and camp a week, killing as many deer as they could make use of, jerking a good portion to take home with them and having a general good time feasting on trout, venison and other game, and amusing themselves shooting at marks, pitching quoits, etc. I will add that the main reason they went to this camp was for a good time rather than the game, as game was plentiful right at their homes in those days. Well, it was at one of these outings that I killed my first bear. I was about thirteen years old, and, of course, in my own mind, it made a mighty hunter of me, not to be compared with Esau of old. It was in June and shortly after we got to camp there was a heavy thunder storm, but it all passed over before sundown, the sun coming out nice and bright. I was determined to go with some of the men to watch a lick (there were three or four licks not far away), but none of the men cared to have my company, and they said it was likely to rain again and made many excuses why I should not go to watch a lick with them. Just before they were ready to start out to the lick we heard a wolf howl away off on the hills and they (the men) put up the wolf scare on me and said that there would be no deer come to the lick so long as wolves were in the neighborhood. I took their stories all in but insisted that I would watch a lick all the same. There was a lick only a few hundred yards from camp, but for some cause deer rarely ever worked it. When they saw that I was going to watch a lick in spite of thunder storms, wolves or all the rest of the excuses that they could make, they finally said that I could watch the lick which I have mentioned and get eaten up by wolves. There was a blazed line from camp to the lick and when the men started for the licks that each one had decided on watching, I started to the lick that was given me to watch. There was one man left in camp to watch the horses and to keep camp. This man said that when he heard me shoot he would come up and help me bring in the deer. The blind at the lick was a scaffold built up in a tree twenty or thirty feet from the ground. I climbed to the scaffold and placed the old gun in the loops that were fastened to limbs on the tree to give the gun the proper range to kill the deer, should one come to the lick after it was too dark to see to shoot. Nothing came round the lick before dark, but as soon as it got dark I could hear animals walking and jumping on all sides of me and one old inquisitive porcupine came up the tree to see what I was doing. He perched himself on a limb not more than two feet from my face and sat there and chattered his teeth until I could stand it no longer. I took the large powder horn that I had strung over my shoulder with a cord and gave the porcupine a rap on the nose that sent him tumbling down the tree. I remember well how other animals scampered from under the tree when the porcupine tumbled down. At that time I wondered what it all was, but later I learned that all these animals were only flying squirrels, rabbits and porcupines, but I imagined that the noises were made by anything but squirrels and rabbits. Well, about eleven o'clock I heard something coming towards the lick with a steady tread like that of a man and again I was taken with a chill that caused the scaffold to shake, but the chill only lasted for a moment. Soon I heard the animal step in the soft mud and directly it began to suck the salt from the dirt and I was sure that it was a deer and that it was the right time to pull the trigger, which I did. When the report of the gun died away all that I could hear were the same noises that were made when I knocked the old porcupine from the tree. I now feared that I had pulled the gun on some other animal rather than a deer. I thought the report of the gun would frighten all the deer in the woods, so that no deer would go to the licks the men were watching. I was afraid I would get a terrible scolding by the men who were watching the other licks when they came to camp in the morning. After waiting some time and hearing no noise of any kind, I concluded to get down and go to camp. Upon getting down from the tree I decided that I would go and look in the lick and see if I could tell what it was that I had heard there and had shot at. As it was so dark that I could not see from the blind, you can imagine my surprise when I got to the lick to see a large buck deer lying broadside as dead as could be. I immediately lost all fear of being scolded by the other men, so I claimed first blood. I began calling for the man who remained in camp but could get no answer from him so I went down to camp and found him fast asleep. I awakened him and we immediately made a torch and went to the lick and dragged the deer to camp. Then we took out the entrails and bunked down for the rest of the night. The next thing that I knew, one of the men who had watched a lick not far away was kicking me and saying, ""Get out of this, you old deer slayer, you, and get some venison frying for breakfast."" We were soon up for the sun was shining brightly and more than an hour high. Soon the other watchers came in and reported that not a sound of a deer had they heard about their licks. Two or three of us (I say ""us"" because I was now counted as one of them) went to catch trout for breakfast, while the others were at work taking care of the venison and preparing breakfast, boiling coffee, frying venison and trout. And so the day was spent, sleeping, cocking and eating until it was again time to go to the licks, as the men wished to get another deer so as to have plenty of venison to take home with them. When the men were about ready to start to their watching places, one of them inquired of me what I would do as there was no further use of watching the lick where I had killed the deer, as it was blooded from the deer I had killed. The man who had watched the lick nearest the camp, and quite an old man, said that I could watch the lick that he had watched and he would stay in camp. (The men now acknowledged me as a thoroughbred hunter, you see.) Well, I was getting there pretty lively, I thought, when an old hunter would give up his lick to me, when only the evening before none of the men thought that I was up to watching a lick at any price. I was pleased to again have a place to watch. Taking some punk wood to make a little smoke to keep off the gnats and mosquitoes, I started for the lick and climbed the Indian ladder to the scaffold, built in a hemlock tree. I had barely got fixed in shape to begin to watch when I chanced to look towards a small ravine that came down from the hill a few yards to my left and saw what I took to be a black yearling steer. I will add that the woods in that locality were covered with a rank growth of nettles, cow cabbage and other wood's feed, and people would drive their young cattle off into that locality to run during the summer. I thought I would get down from the scaffold and throw stones at it and drive it off lest it might come into the lick after dark and I might take it for a deer and shoot it. As I started to climb down I again looked in the direction of the steer, and this time I saw what I thought was the largest bear that ever traveled the woods. He had left the ravine and was walking with his head down, going up the hill and past the lick. I cocked both barrels of the gun and raised it carefully to my shoulder, and, breaking a little dry twig I had in my hand caused the bear to stop and turn his head around so as to look down the hill. This was my time so I leveled on his head and shoulders and let go both barrels of the gun at once. The bear went into the air and then began tumbling and rolling down the hill towards the tree that I was in, bawling and snorting like mad. But if the bear made a howl from pain he was in, it was no comparison to the howl that I made for help and it did not cease until the men in camp came on the run thinking that I had accidentally shot myself. Well, this was my first bear and it was the greatest day of my life. We took the bear to camp, skinned and dressed it and then went to bunk for the night, but it was very little I slept for I could only think what a mighty hunter I was (in my mind). The men came in in the morning with no better luck than they had the night before, and they all declared that if I had not been with them they would have had to go without venison. The men said that we had meat in plenty now and that we would not watch the licks any more that time, so they put in their time jerking the venison and also some of the bear meat. They built a large fire of hemlock bark, and when it was burned down to a bed of coals so that there was no longer any smoke, they made a rack or grate of small poles, laid in crotches driven in the ground, so as to have the grate over the coals, and then laid the slices of venison on this grate and stood green bark about the grate to form a sort of an oven. The strips of meat were first sprinkled with salt and wrapped up in the skin from the deer and allowed to remain wrapped in the skin for a few hours until the salt would strike through the meat so as to make it about right as to salt. The men remained in camp about a week. They would shoot at a mark, pitch quoits and have jumping contests and other amusements, including fishing, eating trout, venison and bear meat along with toasted bread and coffee and potatoes roasted in the ashes. * * * The time had arrived when I thought that I must take to the taller timber to trap and hunt. I searched among the boys of my age, in the neighborhood, for a partner who would go with me to the Big Woods, as the section where I wished to go, was called. I finally found a pard who said he would go with me and stay as long as I cared to. The middle of October came. We packed our knapsacks with a grub stake, a blanket or two, and taking our guns started for the Big Woods, with a feeling that is not known to those who are not lovers of the wild. As we only had a limited number of steel traps it was our intention to spend the first week in camp, building deadfalls for coon and mink and use the steel traps for fox. Our intention was to build as many deadfalls as we would be able to attend to before we baited and set any of them. We had built our traps on many of the small brooks and streams to the south and east of the camp, and had built traps on the stream on which the camp was located nearly a mile below camp. About a mile and a half below camp there was another branch coming in from the north. Pard and I started early one morning to finish the line of traps on the camp stream and then go up the stream that came from the north and build as many traps as we could during the balance of the day. We had finished the line of traps on the camp stream, and had built a trap or two on the other branch, when pard complained of having a bad headache, but refused to go to camp. We built another trap or two, when pard consented to go to camp, if I would build another trap on a little spring run where coon signs were plentiful, which I readily consented to do. When I got the trap done it was nearly sundown. It was about three miles to camp so I hurried to see how pard was feeling. I had not gone more than a half mile on my way from where pard turned back to go to camp, when I found him lying on the ground. He said that he was feeling so sick that he was unable to go any further and complained that every bone in his body ached. After explaining to pard the conditions under which we were placed, it was with difficulty that I managed to get him up, and by supporting and half carrying him I managed to get him along a few rods at a time. I could see that he was continually growing worse. After I had helped until we were within about three-quarters of a mile of camp, he begged me to let him lie down and rest. I tried to urge him along by explaining that I must go for a team to get him out of the woods, and that I could not leave him lying there on the damp ground. It was of no use; I could not get him to go any further. While I was somewhat older than pard, he was much the heavier, and I was unable to carry him. Taking in the situation, there was only one thing for me to do and that was to leave him and go for help. After making him promise that as soon as he rested he would work his way to camp I took off my coat, and put it under him, again making him promise to get to camp, I started for help. The night was dark and it was miles through the woods to the first house. When I came to camp I stopped long enough to get a bite to eat which I took in my hand. After lighting a fire so if pard did manage to get to camp he would have a good fire, I started for help. Wherever the light would get through the trees enough so that I could see the path, I would take a trot. After the first mile and a half I came to the turnpike road where I could make better time although it was dense woods. After about six or seven miles I reached the first clearing and from there the rest of the way was more or less clearings and I could see the road better and was able to make better time. I reached pard's home about a mile before I came to my home, rattled at the door and called for pard's father. I told him the condition of his son. He requested me to go to my home and get some of my family to take a team and start back at once after his son; he would go after a doctor and have the doctor there when we got back with the boy. I lost no time in getting started back. We could not get nearer than a mile and a half to the camp, as we were obliged to leave the wagon road at that point, and go down a very steep hill and only a trail cut through the woods. When we reached the camp, contrary to expectations, we found Orlando (that was pard's name) lying in the bunk in camp but he said that he was feeling no better. It was after midnight and we lost no time in getting him on one of the horses and started back to the wagon which we reached with some difficulty. On reaching the wagon we laid him on a straw bed which we had brought for the purpose and got back to his home sometime after daybreak. The doctor was there and after examining pard said he feared it was a bad case of fever. I waited a few days to see if he would be able to go back to camp and then the doctor told me that he would not be out of bed in two months and advised me to keep out of the woods or I would be brought out on a stretcher. I had my mind on all those deadfalls that we had built and all the coon, mink and fox that we could catch, and was determined to go back to camp notwithstanding our friend's advice to the contrary. After looking around for another partner which I was unable to find as no one wished to go and stay longer than a day or two (what we call summer trappers), I again packed my knapsack and went back to camp. The next morning, after catching a good lot of trout for coon and mink bait, I began the work of setting the hundred or more deadfalls that pard and I had built. As soon as I had all the deadfalls set I hunted up good places to set the traps that we had. I was so busy all the time that there was no chance to get lonesome. Every day there were coon and mink to skin and stretch. Now and then a big, old coon was so strong that he would tear the deadfall to pieces and I would be compelled to build it all over and make it stronger. What a difference there is now with the many styles of traps and the H-T-T to guide the young hunter and trapper. If I could have had a couple dozen of the No. 1 1/2 Victor traps made as at the present time, I would have been as proud as a small boy with a new pair of boots, although I think what was lacking in modern traps was fully made up by the number of furbearing animals. I had been so busy during the two weeks I was in camp that I had forgotten the day of the week; neither did I take time to kill a deer or to go up to the road to see if anyone had written, to see if I was dead or alive. There was a stage passed over the road twice a week. I had nailed a box with a good tight lid on a tree by the road so that I could send a line out home for anything I wanted or my family could write to me. I had two or three traps set for foxes up towards the road along the edge of a laurel patch where there were plenty of rabbits and the foxes worked around to catch rabbits. I thought I would go to the road and be there about the time the stage passed along and see if I could hear anything from pard and the folks at home and then I could tend the traps on my way back to camp. [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS CATCH.] I was at the road shortly before the stage came along and was surprised as well as delighted to see a neighbor boy by the name of Frank Curtis aboard the stage as he had said he would come over and stay a day or two with me in camp. Frank had not been allowed to spend much time with a gun or traps, but like most boys, he liked a gun. My mother died before I was eleven years old and father allowed me to trap and hunt about as I liked. When we got down near the traps we set our packs down--I say we, for my folks had sent me a new supply of provisions--and went to look after the traps. The first one had a rabbit leg in it and it was plain to be seen that some animal had eaten the rabbit. We reset the trap and went on to the next trap which was set in a little gorge or hollow. A few yards below the trap two large trees had blown down across the little hollow. The tree on the side farthest down the hill from the trap had broken in two where it fell over the hollow and dropped down so that it laid close to the ground while the tree on the upper side, the side nearest the trap, lay a foot from the ground in the hollow. The trees were two or three feet apart right at the hollow but were close together on one side. When we came to where the trap had been set we found trap and drag gone and nothing in sight. We soon discovered the animal which we supposed was a coon, had gone down the ravine toward the two large trees that had fallen across the hollow. We went to the logs and looked between them. There we could see the clog but the animal was crowded back under the logs so we could see but little of it. Frank said that he would get between the logs and poke the coon out. I told him that he had better let me go, as I was afraid that he would take a hold of the clog and pull the trap loose from the coon's foot, but Frank grabbed a stick and jumped between the logs. He had hardly struck the ground when he gave a fearful yell and there was a spitting, snarling animal close at his heels. He scrambled out from between the logs, as white as a sheet. I then saw that it was a wildcat and a mad one. I cut a good stout stick and while Frank stood on the bank with his gun, I poked the cat from under the log by punching it, until Frank could see it enough to shoot it. We pulled the cat out from between the logs, took the trap from its foot, reset it and took the cat with our traps and went to camp, declaring in our minds that there was no other such mighty trappers as we. Frank declared that he was nearly famished with hunger so we had supper and then skinned the cat. We did not sleep much that night as Frank had to tell me all about things at home. He also told me that pard was no better. Every time an owl would hoot, or a rabbit or porcupine or a mouse would make a noise in the leaves, Frank would give me a punch and ask what it was. Frank remained three days in camp and then he took the stage back home, that being as long as his parents would allow him to stay. I went to the road to see him off. When leaving he made many declarations that he would come back to camp, although he never did. The snow now began to lie on the ground as it fell and it began to get cold at night. Coon did but little traveling and some way, after Frank had been over to camp and stayed those three days, I seemed to get homesick. I had not become expert enough to make a business of deer hunting and marten and bear trapping, so I sprung the deadfalls and took up the few steel traps that I had and began to take my furs and other plunder to the road to take the stage home. After going home I went to school for a few weeks. I no longer remember how many coon, mink and other furs I caught, but it was quite a bunch for furs were very plentiful in those days. CHAPTER VI. A Hunt on the Kinzua. Comrades, as I have not been able to trap any for the past two years--1905 and 1906--and as I have previously served for more than 50 years almost without cessation, along the trap line, I beg to be admitted to your ranks as one of the ""Hasbeens."" I will therefore tell of one of my trips on a hunting and trapping expedition in the fall and winter of 1865-6, a party of two besides myself. My two companions' names were Charles Manly and William Howard. We started about the 15th of October for Coudersport with a team of horses and wagon loaded with the greater part of our outfit and went to Emporium, Cameron County, where we hit the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. The only railroad that touched Northwestern Pennsylvania at that time. Here we took the railroad to Kane, a town in Southwestern McKean County, where we stopped one day and made purchases for three months' camping. We hired a good team here to take our outfit about seven or eight miles on to Kinzua Creek. Almost the entire distance was through the woods and over the rock. There was no sign of a road only as we went ahead of the team and cut a tree or log here and there. The outfit was lashed onto a bobsled, and as we had bargained with the man to make the trip for a stated price, he did not seem to care whether there was any road or not, so that he got through as quickly as possible. We reached the stream about noon. The man fed his team some oats, swallowed a few mouthsful himself and was soon on his way back to town, while we began laying plans for our camp. We selected a spot on a little rise of ground near a good spring of water, and where there was plenty of small yellow birch trees handy to cut logs out of for camp. We placed a good sized log down first at the end of the shanty that we intended to build the fire place in. Another was placed at the end that was to be the highest, so to give the right slope to the roof, which was a shed roof. We always kept the large ends of the logs one way, so that when we had the logs rolled up it made the lower or eaves end of the camp about five feet high. There was a slope of about two feet for the roof. We felled bass wood trees which we split in half, and then dug or scooped them out so as to make a trough. We notched the two end logs down and then placed the scoops or troughs in these notches so that they would lay firm with the hollow side up. After placing these scoops across the entire width of the shack we then placed another layer of the scoops (reverse) on the first set. That is to say, the rounding side up. This made a very good roof but required a good deal of chinking at the ends to keep the cold out, but as moss was plenty, it was not a long job. The second day after we got into the woods we had the camp in pretty good shape, well chinked and calked. The third day we worked on the fire place, laying it up to the jam of stone, then we finished the chimney with logs and mud. We had a fairly comfortable camp with but two exceptions. These were, no windows, and for a door we had what I called a ""hoghole,"" that was a door so small that one had to get down on all fours to get in or out. On the fourth day we intended to cut wood all day, and were at it before it was fairly light, but before 10 o'clock it began to snow. In a couple of hours there was a good tracking snow and the boys were bound to go out and see if they could not kill a deer. I tried hard to get them to stick to the wood job, but it was no use, they must go hunting. There was no partnership business in this hunt. It was every man for himself, and the dogs, take the hindermost. I told the boys I would stay in camp and do something at the wood job. I had been along the creek a little the day before, poking my nose under the banks and old drifts to see what manner of signs I could see, and I had noticed several mink tracks. The boys had no more than gone when I had a fishing tackle rigged out. It consisted of a line braided from horsehair, out of a horse's tail, and a hook baited with some bits of fat pork. It did the business, for the stream fairly swarmed with trout. Taking three or four trout for bait, I was soon at work building deadfalls. It was not long before I had three or four built close up under the banks and behind logs where I thought the boys would not see them. I then scampered back to camp and went to cutting wood like a good boy. I had only just got to camp when I heard a gun shot away up the creek, and in about an hour Charley came dragging a yearling deer. Will did not show up for some time after dark, but had nothing, though he said that he had a fair standing shot at a large buck, but his gun snapped on him and he lost. The next morning we were out at the peep of day, each one going his own way. I went down the creek so that I could take a peep at my traps. None had been disturbed until I came to the last one. There, to my satisfaction, I found a mink. As I had passed a small run that emptied into the main creek I noticed that some animal had gone over a pole that lay across a little run and partly in the water. The animal had brushed the snow off the pole in going over it. I gave it no particular attention, thinking that it was a coon, but when I got the mink I thought I would go back to camp, make a stretching board and stretch the mink skin and get a trap and set at the run for the coon, as I supposed. I will mention that furs were bringing about the same prices then as at the present time, 1907, a good No. 1 mink being worth about $10. Near the camp was a large elm tree that was hollow, and the fire had burned a hole out on one side up the tree, nearly as high as a man's head. After I had stretched the mink skin I hung it up in this hollow tree, and it was a very good place to dry the pelts that I caught. The boys never mistrusted that I was doing any trapping for small game. To get back to my job, I took one out of three steel traps No. 3, and all the traps that we had brought with us. In fact, the other boys did not care to trap. When I got back at the run I gave more attention to the trail of the supposed coon, and discovered that it was an otter. With greater caution I waded up the run until I found a suitable place to set the trap, knowing that he would be back that way again sooner or later. After setting the trap I climbed the ridge to look for deer and got two shots during the afternoon but missed both. All came to camp that night without killing any deer. I had seen a number of marten tracks during the afternoon. The next morning it was thawing and the boys feared they would lose the tracking snow, so Charley and Will hurried to localities where they expected to find deer. I sliced some strips of venison from the fore-quarters, or rather what was left of the fore-quarters, of the deer Charley had killed the first day out. I made tracks to the ridge where I had seen the marten tracks, and I lost no time in putting up deadfalls at the best pace I was capable of getting into. In the afternoon on my way to camp I came to the creek some ways below where I had set the mink traps, so I put up two or three more deadfalls for mink. I also found a big flood drift which otter were using for their feeding grounds. I selected places to set the other two steel traps which were in camp, and then went to camp, looking at the mink traps on the way, but found that none had been disturbed. When I got to camp I found both Charley and Will there, and each had killed a deer. Will had killed a good sized buck close to camp, so he dragged it down to the shanty to dress and hang up. The boys gave me the laugh because I had not killed any deer. I told them to hold their breath and I would get into the harness after a bit. In the morning the snow was all gone and the boys were afraid that it was going to get so warm that their venison would spoil. Cuts were drawn to see which one of them should go to Kane to get a team to take out their venison. It fell on Charley. They tried to have me join in the draw, but I told them that I did not see where I came in as I had no venison to spoil. The weather kept warm for several days, so I kept building deadfalls on the different ridges for marten and along the creek for mink and coon. Charley and Will continued to still hunt, killing several deer. When the snow came again I had all the traps up I intended to build, but it turned out that later I built two deadfalls for bear. I now put in my time still hunting, shaping my course as much as possible so as to tend to my traps. I killed a deer occasionally as did the other boys. I set the two steel traps on the drift where I had seen the otter signs, and the second time I looked at them I found an otter tangled up in one of the traps. I was also getting mink, marten and coon now and then, and occasionally I would get two mink or marten in one day. I would cut a long slender withe to stretch the skins over, bending them in the form of a stretching board the best I could and hang the pelts in the old elm tree and kept mum. I remembered the old adage, ""he that laughs last, laughs best,"" and was bound to have the last laugh. One night Will came in and said that a bear had eaten up the offal where he had dressed a deer. I asked him if he was going to set a trap for him, and he said that he had no trap to set. I told him to build a deadfall. Will said that I could have that job if I wanted it. I told him all right if he would tell me where to find the place. He said that he would go with me in the morning and show me. In the morning I took the best axe, some bait and went with Will to the place where the bear had eaten the offal. We saw that the bear had been back there during the night and cleaned up the remains left the previous night. I selected a good sized beech tree, where I could fell it so that I could cut a piece from the butt for the bottom piece and have the remainder of the tree come so that I could use a small tree for one of the stakes or posts. When I pulled off my coat and began chopping on the tree Will gave me the laugh again, and said that I had more days' work in me than brains, or something to that effect. It was my intention to get the trap all ready and then get one of the boys to help me set it. I got the trap done and saw that by using a long lever or pry I could set the trap without the aid of another. With the pry I raised the dead piece up as high as I wanted it. Then tied the lever to a sapling to hold the dead log in place, using the figure four trigger. I placed a bit of log in the bait pen to rest the bait spindle on. I then placed the trigger in place and pressed them between the logs to steady them until I could release the lever and let the weight onto the trigger. I then put some poles onto the dead log to make doubly sure that I had weight enough to kill any bear that traveled those woods. I now went to camp giving myself credit of doing a good job. When the boys came in the night of the day I built the first deadfall for bear, they both reported seeing bear tracks and they said the tracks all seemed to be going south. I told the boys that the bear were looking up winter quarters, and that if we would all go at it and put up several deadfalls we would stand a fair chance to get a bear or two, but it was no go. They said they would give me a clean title to all the bear I could catch, but they did not care to invest. So I took the axe and some bait and went to the head of a small draft where the boys had seen the bear tracks. I found at the head of this hollow what seemed to be a bear runway or crossing, for three or four bears had passed around the head of this basin in the past few days. With some hard work and heavy lifting I got another good deadfall built that day. The next day I went the rounds of the marten and mink traps, and I think I killed a deer and got two marten. I remember that at this time we had a good snow to hunt on, and that it was not an uncommon thing for us to cut wood for the camp long after dark, and sometimes it was pretty scant at that. I think it was the third day after I had set the first bear trap when Will came in, shortly after Charley and I had got to camp, and as he stuck his head through the hoghole (as I called the substitute for a door) he says, a fool for luck. I suspicioned what was coming and said, ""Well, what kind of luck have you had?"" Will said, ""It is not me that has had the luck, but you have got one of the Jed-blasted bears up there in that rigging you built, you ever see."" I remember that I had some kind of a hipo that night, so that I would laugh every now and then ""kindy"" all by myself. I do not think that I slept much that night, though it was not the first bear I had ever caught. I thought it was beginning to look as though the laugh was coming my way all right. In the morning the boys went to the trap with me and helped get the bear out of the trap and helped set the trap again, and then went on with their deer hunting. I went to skinning the bear, and it was all I did that day to skin that bear and stretch the skin on the shanty. I told the boys when they came in that night that I thought we were going to have a hard winter, and so I concluded to weatherboard the camp with bear skins. The carcass of the bear was, of course, a complete loss, and that is a serious objection to the deadfall as a bear trap. I think that it was about this time that Will met with an accident in his foot gear, so he went out to Kane after a pair of gum shoes. At this time we had several deer so thought it best to have the team come in and take them out and ship them. When Will came back that evening he said that some kind of an animal had crossed the path about one-half mile from camp, dragging something. He said that he could not make up his mind what it was, but thought it was some kind of an animal in a trap, but we knew of no one trapping in that locality. I did not know but it might be possible that some animal had gotten in one of my otter traps and had broken the chain and gone off with the trap. Early in the morning I went down the creek to look at the traps and see if they were all right. When I came to the Spring Run I saw that my otter (or at least I called it my otter), had again gone up the run, on his usual round of travel. When I came to where the trap was it wasn't there at all. I had fastened the trap to a root that was two or three inches under water and a root that I supposed sound. I was mistaken, for the root was pretty doty and the otter had broken the root and gone with my trap. I lost no time in taking up the chase. The trail led up this run to its source, then over a spur of ridge and down the hill again into a branch of the main stream, then up this branch for a distance of a mile or more, where I came up with him. He had gone under the roots of a large hemlock tree, and it took me two or three hours to get him out with nothing to work with only my belt axe and a sharpened stake. It was nearly night when I got to camp. I made a stretching board from a spault I split out of a basswood log and stretched the otter skin, and put in the balance of the day in chopping wood. One of the boys killed three deer that day. I do not remember which one it was. The next day I made the rounds of nearly all the traps and got what I have many a time before--nothing. I put in three or four days still hunting and had the luck to kill a deer or two, but Charley and Will killed more than I did. I remember, during this time, they were all the time joking me because they were getting more deer than I did. I claimed that they had the best grounds to hunt on, they hunting east of the camp and up nearer the head of the stream, while I hunted west of the camp. We would see bear tracks nearly every day, and Will and Charley would try to get around in their hunting course so as to look at the two bear traps, the traps being in the direction in which they hunted. They found the traps undisturbed. I had about made up my mind that I would get no more bear that trip. I was getting a marten, mink or coon now and then, so that I kept a stiff upper lip if the boys did kill a few deer more than I did. Finally one night when I came to camp I found the carcass of a bear, skin and all lying at the shanty door. I thought it was one that either Charley or Will had killed. I found that the boys by chance had met near one of the bear traps, and going to the trap found the bear. As it was a small one they took it out, set the trap and brought the bear to camp. It was now getting along in December and the snow was getting rather deep and the weather was pretty cold and the game did not move about very much. We all seemed to get a little lazy, and did not get out till after noon. In fact, some days, if the weather was pretty sharp, we did not go out at all but would stay in camp and talk of the hunt and tell where we thought we could find a bunch of deer over in this basin or on that ridge. The most of the deadfalls set I had not covered so to keep the snow off. A good many of them had snowed under, so I did not care how soon we broke camp and went home. Deer were quite plentiful, and we could find them nearly every day, when we would get a move on, so we continued to stay day after day, and putting in about one-half the time hunting and the other half telling what we would have done if there had not been so many ""ifs"" in the way. I would usually shape my course in hunting so as to come around where some of the deadfalls were and spring them. One day I came to one that was pretty well snowed under. I saw that a fox had done a good deal of traveling around the trap and had dug in the snow some about where I thought a marten would be, providing one was there. I kicked the snow away, and to my delight and surprise I found as good a marten as I had caught. I thanked the fox for the favor. I examined all the traps then to make sure that there was nothing in them, but I found no more marten. We now began to get our venison into camp, taking turns to help each other. I do not just remember how many deer we killed, but I think that Charley and Will killed 15 or 16 apiece, and I killed either 11 or 12. The boys said I had done pretty well considering the two bear and otter, but when I went to the old elm and brought out the marten, mink and another otter and five or six coon, the boys looked greatly amazed and Will said, ""I knew the fool was doing something besides hunting,"" Charley said he thought he could smell something that smelled like mink around the camp three or four times. I think I got 13 marten, 8 mink, 5 coon, 2 otter and 2 bears. As near as I can remember, I got a little over a hundred dollars for the fur. I do not remember what we got for the venison, but it was war prices. We shipped our venison to George Herbermann, New York. I tried to have the boys help cut a lot of wood for the next season's hunt, but they said they were not counting chickens as far ahead as that. They hit it right, for neither of them hunted in there. I think Charley hunted on Hunt's Run in Cameron County, and I do not know whether Will hunted at all the next season, but I took a partner and went back on the Kinzua. This time we were in ""swacks,"" and I will try to tell what luck we had some time, but one thing we did was to put a window in the camp and make the door large enough so that one did not have to get down on all fours to get in or out. Will and I stayed in camp while Charley went out to Kane and sent in the team to take out the venison and the furs and the camp outfit. We got home for Christmas and found all well. CHAPTER VII. My Last Hunt on the Kinzua. As this hunt was about 1868, before there were railroads in this section, we went to Emporium, Cameron County, Pennsylvania, and there took the train to Kane, in McKean County, then by team and bobsled route to camp. This making the journey much farther, we concluded to go by wagon the entire distance, which would shorten the distance nearly one-half. This time conditions were different than on previous occasion. While there were three in the party before and every one hunted on his own hook, this time I had a partner and we were to share alike in profit and loss. My partner's name was William Earl, and he had recently moved from Vermont, or, as he would jokingly say, from ""Varmount."" He was somewhat older than myself, and a man who was ever ready to carry his end of the load at all times. We hired a team and took a full line of grub and the camp outfit, with about sixty small traps and eight bear traps. We went by way of Port Allegheny, Devils Blow and Smithport, taking three days to get to camp, as we had to cut out the road a good part of the distance of the last day's travel. They had just begun to operate in the oil industry in the neighborhood of what is now the city of Bradford, and as they used wood altogether for fuel to drill with, there was a great deal of wood being cut for the purpose. Bill, as my partner was familiarly called, used to say that if we could not get fat on venison and bear meat we would take a wood job, but we found plenty to do without the wood job. On reaching the camp the first thing noticeable was that the old hollow elm that I had used for a dryhouse to hang up skins in, had met with foul play, for it lay on the ground, having blown down. This made it necessary to build a sort of leanto against one side of the shanty to hang up our furs, as we did not like to have them hung up in the shanty where they would get more or less smoked. But the first thing we did was to enlarge the door, for it will be remembered that we were obliged to get down on all fours in order to get in or out of the shanty. As we had a good crosscut saw, it did not take long to enlarge the doorway so that one could go in standing up, man fashion. We next cut a window-hole large enough to take a single sash window. Then we replaced the chinkings that the porcupines had gnawed out, calked and mudded all cracks. When this was done, Bill looked it over and said, ""By gum, don't it look like living?"" As it was only about the middle of October we went to work at once on a good supply of wood for the camp. We did not quit until we were sure that we had plenty to last the winter, for we intended to stay as long as it was either profitable or a pleasure. After the wood was cut and piled up near the shanty door, we next set the bear traps, as we had brought bait for the purpose. After the bear traps were set we next looked over the deadfalls that I had built for marten the fall before, putting in a new stake where necessary. We also set crotches and laid poles on them, then covering with hemlock boughs to keep the snow from falling directly on the trap. We fixed up the two deadfalls I had made for bear, as we wished to get all the bear traps out that we could, as we had already seen several signs. We also built a number more deadfalls for marten on different ridges farther up the stream where I had not set any the fall before. We built a number of deadfalls along the streams for mink and coon. It was now getting well along towards the last days of October, so we put in a couple of days hunting deer, as we had to have bait to set our marten and other traps with. The first day's hunting we did not get a deer, though we each got a running shot but missed. The second day I did not see any deer but Bill killed a good sized buck before noon. We now began setting the traps that we had built. Bill baiting and setting the deadfalls, while I commenced on the steel traps. We had not baited and set any of the deadfalls that we had built up to this time. The steel traps we set for fox and wildcats, as there was a bounty of two dollars on wildcats at that time. In setting out the fox traps the knowledge that I had got of the locality was of much benefit to me. I had kept a watch out for warm springs and other good likely places to catch a fox or other animals. After we had all the deadfalls and steel traps out but three or four otter traps, we set one or two at the drift where I caught one the fall before. The others we set where we found otter signs. While setting the traps we got a marten or two, as well as one or two mink and coon. We had had one or two little flurries of snow, but we did not leave the traps to hunt deer. Now that the traps were all set, we divided up the trap lines as best we could for each one to attend to while hunting deer. In dividing up the lines in this way we saved much time, as we would not both be working the same territory. Now business began to get quite lively, and we were seldom in camp until after dark, and we were up early and had breakfast over and our lunch packed in our knapsacks. The lunch usually consisted of a good big hunk of boiled venison and a couple of doughnuts and a few crackers, occasionally the breast of a partridge, fried in coon or bear oil. Sometimes the lunch would freeze in the knapsacks and it would be necessary to gather a little paper bark from a yellow birch and a little rosin from a hemlock, black birch or hard maple tree and build a little fire to thaw the lunch. This, however, was quickly done, and was a pleasure rather than a hardship. I have delighted in eating the lunch in this manner for many a winter on the trap line or trail, as have many other hunters and trappers. Bill and I always had our lunch packed and ready to take up the trail at the first peep of day. Sometimes when we would get in late, tired and wet and our clothes frozen, I would suggest to Bill that we shut up camp and take a wood job, just to see what Bill would have to say. He would say that there would be time to take a wood job in the spring or after he had killed a certain large buck which is usually called ""Old Golden."" There were but a few days but what we either caught some fur or killed a deer, though sometimes we would have a bad streak of luck by wounding a deer, or having some animal take a foot off and escape, but this would make us all the more eager to follow the trail or trap line. [Illustration: WOODCOCK ON THE TRAP LINE.] As we had gotten by this time several deer and had caught three bear (one in one of the deadfalls that I had built the fall before, that Will Howard called that ""dashed dinged riggin',"" when he found the bear in it) we wanted to get them out to Kane, that being the nearest point to a railroad. We started early one morning, Bill taking an axe and I carrying the saw, so that if we found any large trees across the trail that we had cut out the year before we would have the saw to do it with. After carrying the saw some distance and not finding any trees of much size across the road, we left it and only took the axe. We found but very little in the trail to cut out. We got to Kane in time to engage a man with team to come to camp the next day and take out the venison and bear and bring in some necessary commissaries that we were getting short of. It was only a few days after this that I found that a bear got in one of the traps. The trap chain having a swivel that was pretty well worn, broke, and the bear went off with the trap. I followed the trail until the middle of the afternoon, when I became satisfied that Bruin was disgusted with that locality, as he had continued his course nearly due east without a stop. I could see no signs that led me to think that Bruin intended to stop for the next fifty miles. So I gave up the chase and went to camp, getting there long after all good boys should have been in bed. Bill was up and out at the door listening if he could hear a gun shot or anything to indicate what had become of me. We held a council of war before going to bed, and decided to give Bruin another day's rest or travel, as he saw fit to do, before we started on the trail. We would go to all the traps that had not been tended to in the past three or four days and then take up the trail of Bruin and follow him to the end of his trail, no matter how long the trail might be. There was but little danger of the trail becoming snowed under or lost, as there was nearly a foot of snow on the ground, and the trap would make a broad trail in the snow, which was quite easily followed. The next day, as intended, we put in a full day attending the traps and got some fur, but I do not remember just what. We started out on the trail of Bruin with a three days' ration of the usual lunch, boiled venison, ham, doughnuts and biscuits. After following the trail about two hours from the place where I had left it, we came onto a man's track that had taken the trail of our bear. This roiled the temper of the Vermonter somewhat, and if I did not say anything, I had a mighty think on. But we had no cause for alarm at this time. The man after following the trail for a mile or two gave up the chase as a bad job, I guess. He stood and stamped about for some time (we judged by the tracks he had made) and then started back nearly in the same course that he had come. We followed on until dark when we came to a wagon road. Apparently several persons had seen the bear trail, for there was a beaten path for a few yards on either side of the road. We knew nothing about the road or where it went, but finally concluded to take the road leading south for a little ways. If we saw no signs of habitation then we would camp, as that was what we expected to be compelled to do when starting from camp and each had taken a blanket for the purpose. We had not gone far when a man with a sleigh overtook us, and we learned that we were about one and a half miles from what was called Bunker Hill. The man gave us a ride. We went to a boarding house and stayed over night, rather than camping on Bruin's trail, though we got plenty of camping on the trail of Bruin before this hunt was at an end. The next morning we were out early and had breakfast at 6 o'clock and started for the trail which we reached before daylight. We had gone a little way when we heard voices coming along the road. We listened a moment and saw that it was a party of three men who had come to take the bear's trail. We waited until they came up to us and one man said, ""What in blazes are you fellows doing on this bear's track?"" Bill replied rather sharp, ""That's our business, but what are you here for?"" Then they said that one of the men had seen the track the evening before and as there was no one after it, they had come out to follow up the track and kill the bear. They insisted on going after the bear but after some talk we convinced them that we did not need any help and they turned back. We took up the trail and followed it pretty lively for a time, as we did not know but those men would cut around and take the trail ahead of us, though they did not do so. We were now on the waters of Potato Creek and there was a good deal of laurel and here we found the first place that Bruin had stopped and made a bed. It is usually the case that a bear that has a trap on his foot will not travel any great distance before they stop and make a bed and then move a short distance and make another bed. Bruin now began to act more natural, to his family. We began to think that we would soon come to fresh signs at least, but were disappointed for we did not follow the trail far, after we came onto his bed before two men's tracks fell in and took up the trail. After following for some time on the trail of the men and bear, we came to where the bear had made another stop and we could see that the bear's track was much fresher showing that it had stopped some time. We expected that the men would divide here, one taking the trail while the other worked on the side, but both men continued on the same trail. After following the trail for three or four hundred yards farther, we came onto another bed and this time the bear went out on the jump and Bill said some cuss words about the men. It is possible that I did too. The trail here turned north. This took us into a section more thickly settled and hunters more numerous. The greater part of the time there was from one to two men on the trail ahead of us and all that was left for us to do was to follow on as fast as we could. The second night we were on the head of Salt Run and we followed the trail till dark. We now had the bear trail to follow instead of the men as all the men had left to go to their camps or homes. Bill said that we would sleep ""dash-dang"" close to the trail after this, so we soon found a large log to build a fire against. First we would build the fire out a few feet from the log after scraping the snow away. Then we would throw a few hemlock boughs over a pole laid in crotches and then move the fire down against the log, throw a few boughs on the ground where the fire had been moved from and the camp was complete in a very few minutes. We now began to fear that some one would get in ahead of us and kill the bear and we would lose bear, trap and all. Bill said that we would follow so ""dash-darn"" close that we would be up in time to attend the funeral. We were so close up that we were no longer bothered only a little while at a time as we would soon overtook any one who hit the trail ahead of us and followed it. The bear again turned east which took us across the road which runs from Coudersport to Emporium in Cameron County. We were now back in Potter County and only 15 miles from home. Bruin here turned south and true to his nature, led us through all the windfalls and laurel patches to be found and occasionally would break down a few laurel and act as though he intended to camp for a time but apparently would change his mind and go on again. We were now on the waters of the Conley and night was fast coming on. The trail led across a little bog and we were looking for water and a suitable place to camp, when Bill called my attention to a man standing on the trail watching us. When we came to him it proved to be a neighbor of ours. Mr. Ephraim Reed, who was hunting in there and said that his camp was only a little way down the hollow and asked us to go down and stay over night. We were glad to do so. Mr. Reed said that there were a good many hunters in that locality so we were up and on the trail before it was fairly light. We were in a section where there was a great deal of laurel and Bruin continued to make camps but as often would change his mind and move on and Bill thought he had concluded to go to the can brake in Virginia. Often when he would go into a wind jam or laurel thicket, we would separate, one taking a circuit on one side of the thicket, the other on the other side, meeting on the opposite side from where the trail had entered but we would always find that Bruin was still on the go. We were in a locality where there were apparently a good many deer and we saw signs of marten quite often. We were now on the head waters of Hunts Run in Cameron county and we decided to make that section our next hunting ground. While the trail would wind about some, yet bruin's general course was south. Often when bruin would vary considerably from his general course and go into a thicket or wind jam, we would feel sure that this time we would find him napping, but we were disappointed each time. Once when we were circling one of these thickets, I drove a deer out and it ran to Bill who gave him his finish. We were near a lumber camp and sold it for ten dollars and our night's lodging and some grub. We were now getting pretty well down to the railroad near Sterling Run. We were sure that bruin was going to cross the railroad so we left the trail and went down to the railroad and followed along the road until we came to the trail. The bear had crossed the road during the night and no one had noticed the trail. Here I suggested to Bill that we take a train to Kane and go to camp and go out and take a wood job, but Bill thought that we had about all the job on our hands that we were able to attend to. He was right, for as near as I can remember, the trail led us nearly a half day's tramp before bruin made a stop. The foot that the trap was on began to bleed considerably. We began to fear that the foot would come off and bruin relieved of the trap would escape after all. We now had some more help, two men took the trail ahead of us following it until nearly dark when they apparently held a council of war, judging from the way they tracked about where they left the trail. We were now in a pine slashing and concluded to camp on the trail, though we knew that we were not far from a lumber camp as we could hear men chopping and driving oxen. We were lucky in finding a good place to camp and water close at hand. As we had a small tin pail with us and coffee, we made a pail of coffee and ate our lunch and fixed our bunk, then we sat down before the fire for a time and talked over what we thought we might do the next day. Then we rolled up in our blankets and it was time to get the coffee boiling again before we were hardly aware that we had been asleep. Bruin now began to act more like a sensible bear and would zigzag about from one thicket to another. We now got close enough to him so that we heard him in the brush several times. Bill said that he thought that bruin was about to make up his mind to let us take off that handcuff. He proved to be right, for it was not long before bruin's trail led down onto the side of a steep ravine. The sides were not more than one hundred yards apart and were quite clear (only for the piles of pine tree tops) from fallen trees, that had been taken out for logs. We were standing a little way down the side of the ravine, laying plans as to our next move, as we had come to the conclusion that bruin had either turned down along the side of the ravine or had gone into camp. We had planned that one would go up around the head of the ravine while the other waited on the trail until the one that went around should get on the opposite side. While still laying plans, we saw bruin come out on the opposite side and began to climb the hill. We had followed the bear for six days and this was the first time that we had seen his lordship. He would go a few steps and stop and look back. We watched our opportunity and when he made a stop, we both fired. Bruin made a jump or two up the hill then tumbled back down again and the fun had ended. We took the entrails out and left him lying across a log and went down the ravine to where there was a lumber camp and there we found that we were on Dent's Run, a branch of Bennet's Branch and in Elk county. This was the fourth county we had been in since we had taken the bear's trail. They told us at the lumber camp that there would be three or four teams go down to the railroad station at Driftwood the next morning with spars which they were hauling to the river to raft. We got a man with a yoke of oxen and a bobsled to go with us and get the bear and the next morning about 5 o'clock we got the bear strapped onto one of the spars and started down the stream to the railroad and we shipped it, without removing the skin, to New York, where we got either $26 or $28 for it. We took the train to Kane where we stayed over night. The next morning we went to camp and found all well with one exception, that being, that the shanty was swarming with ""deer mice"" and a porcupine had tried hard to gnaw his way through the door. The following day we stayed in camp and rested before starting out to see what would turn up the next day. We first looked at the bear traps, tending what small traps came in on the way. On going the rounds of the bear traps, we found them all undisturbed except one, which might better have been as it only had a porcupine in it and we did not see any signs of bear. We began to think of taking up the bear traps as we thought that bruin had gone into winter quarters. We did not get around to take them up for several days, being busy tending the smaller traps. It was now getting along into December and the snow was quite deep. We concluded to put in the time hunting deer as we wished to get all we could, to send out with the team, when we had it come in, as it did not cost any more to take out a full load than half a load. The law closed on deer the first of January, although allowing the hunters 15 days to dispose of his venison after it was unlawful to kill deer. We hustled from early morning until long after dark, when we would get to camp and there was hardly a day that we did not kill at least one deer and some days two or three between us. I will tell of a little scrape I had one day with a yearling buck that I thought to be dead. I was following the trail of three or four deer along the side of a ridge, expecting every moment to catch them feeding, when I heard a noise behind me and looking back, I saw this little buck coming full tilt right towards me. The deer saw me about as soon as I did him and wheeled to run back when I fired and he went down. I set my gun against a tree and started to cut the deer's throat. I took the deer by the ear and straightened his back. About this time that dead deer began to get pretty lively and was trying to get on his feet and as I could not reach my gun, threw myself onto him, thinking to hold him down. Well I held him about as long as lightning would stay on a limb. When I got through gazing at the hole in the brush where I last saw him, I found that I was sadly in need of a new pair of trousers and vest, as well as a jack knife. I searched a long time in hopes of finding the knife, but did not. I had another knife at camp and after about a two hour's job with needle and thread, I managed to get the trousers so that they were passable in a pinch and all the time that I was repairing the trousers, Bill sat there laughing at me. Now this was the first time that I had supposed dead deer come to life and give me the go-by, though it was not the last time. I had given him what is called a fine shot, that is I had shot him just across the back and the ball had struck one of the joints or knuckles of the backbone as it proved. I had the satisfaction of killing the same deer two or three days later or at least we thought it was the same one. We had three or four days of mild weather and as we had not been the rounds of the traps for several days, only tending those that came handy while hunting deer, we thought we would reverse the plan and go over all the traps and pay but little attention to deer hunting unless we struck a hot trail. We thought we would take in those traps first in the direction where the bear traps were and go to the traps farthest from camp and bring in some of the traps. We did not expect to get any more bear as it was too late in the season for bear to travel until they had their winter's sleep. We were in luck this time for as we had usually tended the bear traps, the one that we went to first would have been the last trap to come to. When we came in sight of where the trap was set we saw that there had been a bear dance going on. As the snow was several inches deep, we saw at a glance which way the bear had gone and we only had to step to the brow of the ridge and look down the hillside a little way to see bruin fast among some small saplings. He was rolling and tumbling about trying to release himself. He looked like a great black ball as he rolled about. We lost no time in putting him out of his trouble. We skinned the fore parts and hung them up in a sapling to use for bait for fox and marten and took the saddles to camp, skinned them out and stretched the skin on the shanty. Later we shipped the saddles to market. The next day we looked at the balance of the bear traps but found them undisturbed but we concluded to leave them set a few days longer. On going the rounds of the smaller traps, we got a fox or two also a marten or two, but as I remember it, we got no mink or otter at this time. We now had the traps all looked after, so we put in the time hunting deer as the time for deer hunting was soon to close. The weather had turned and frozen so that it had formed a sharp crust and we were compelled to use the driving method of hunting. One of us would stand on the runways, in the beds of basins and in low places on the ridges while the other would follow the trail and drive the deer through to the hunter. I wish to say right here, that I do not like this way of hunting deer but little better than I do of hounding and running deer with dogs. The dog is all right but I want no dogging of deer for me. We would get a deer nearly every day. It was now the first of January and time to get our venison to camp or out to the road where we could pick them up on the way out to Kane. After we had gathered up the venison and had gone the rounds of the traps that had not been tended while hunting, we went to Kane. Here we engaged a team to come in after the venison and bear and bring in a grub stake to last us until the middle of March when we would break camp and go home. We both went back to Kane with the team to assist in getting over some of the rough places and see that our venison and bear meat was tagged and shipped all right. Then we came back to camp to put our entire time in tending to the traps which we did to good advantage. We had found other good warm springs while hunting, and some that we thought were lasting springs, had gone dry or had frozen up, so we shifted a good many of the traps to the other springs. Then we took it a little easier only going the rounds of the traps as we considered it necessary and on such days as the weather was favorable. We waited for February when we knew that the old dog coon would begin his rounds of calling on his friends. We managed to pass the time away fairly well as we would get a fox, mink, marten or something nearly every day so that we busied ourselves. About the middle of February we had several warm days and the time had now come for us to get busy and we were out as soon as it was light. We would follow up all the spring runs until we found the trail of a coon, then follow it up until it went into a tree. Sometimes it bothered us which tree to cut down for the coon would go from one tree to another so that it was hard to tell which was the tree that was the home of the coon (some call it a den). One day we chopped down a great large oak, three or four feet in diameter and nearly sound all the way through and nary a coon to be found. I asked Bill why he did not say cuss words and he said he thought we had spent enough wind in chopping the tree down, without wasting any unnecessarily. Well, as I said, the coon had been up and down so many trees that we did not know which one was the most likely one. We went to a large basswood tree that had only one track going to it and one away from it but when we pounded on it with the axe, we saw that it was very hollow. I suggested to Bill that we chop it down. Bill thought there were no coon in it and I had but little faith myself but I told him that as he had been wanting a wood job, here was his opportunity and Bill agreed with me, so we laid off our coats and went to chopping. The tree was only a shell. We soon had it down and to our surprise, coon began to run in all directions. Not having had much hopes of finding any coon in the tree we had not prepared ourselves with clubs to kill the coon. We used the axe handle as best we could but one coon got away and went into a hollow stump which we had to cut down. We got five coon. We then took up the trail of the coon that left the tree and after following it about a mile it went into a large hemlock tree that had a hole in it close to the roots. Pounding on it we discovered that it was hollow. There had been several coon tracks both out and into the tree. We circled around some distance from the tree and found no tracks leading away from the tree farther than a small spring a few rods away. As it was getting well on towards night we did not fell the tree but went back to the old basswood where we had left the coons and took them and went to camp. Bill said that he had a dash-dang sight rather chop wood than to tote those three coons. I carried two and told Bill not to complain and I would let him skin all of them when we got to camp. He said, ""Oh, you are a clever jade, aint you?"" We skinned the coon that evening but did not stretch the skin until the next afternoon after we had gone out and cut the hemlock and got three more. We kept up this coon hunt as long as we could find any tracks. It was now getting along into March and we had written home for a team to come in and take our camp outfit and furs out. As we had not been out over the road through the woods, the way we came in, we made a trip out to the main wagon road so that the man who came after us would have no trouble in following the trail to the camp. We now began to spring all the deadfalls that we had set for marten, mink and coon and take up all of the steel traps as we had written to the man to be there about the fifteenth of the month. I think it was a day or two later when the team came and our hunt on the Kinzua was ended. We got some thirty odd deer and either five or six bear and I think four otter. I do not remember the number of fox, mink, marten and coon, but we did well for there had been but very little trapping done in that locality at that time and furbearing animals were quite plentiful. I have never been back to that camp since. I gave the camp to a man by the name of Ball. CHAPTER VIII. Fred and the Old Trapper. Yes, Fred, you can go with me to attend my traps, come down early as I wish to start at 5 o'clock."" Fred was on hand next morning at the appointed hour. We leave the road here and go up this stream; this will take us to several traps and also to camp. ""Are these woods very large?"" ""Yes, Fred. It is about fourteen miles either way through them."" ""Does any one live in them?"" ""No one only the lumberman. Well, Fred, here is the first trap."" ""I don't see any trap."" ""No, but it is there, just in front of that little stone pen; the bait is in the pen."" ""Why don't you take that bush away?"" ""Oh! that is part of the knack in trapping; see that is just far enough from the pen to let the animal pass through."" ""Oh! I see, and it will step in the trap in going through!"" ""That is it, exactly."" ""Won't the water take the brush away?"" ""Yes, if it gets too high, but you will see that I have put some heavy stones on the limbs that are down in the water; you also see that I turn the water above the trap by throwing up a few stones; this is done to keep the water so that it just covers the traps. You see that bunch of leaves that are a little higher than the rest of the leaves--the pan of the trap is just under those leaves."" ""Did that moss grow on the stone pen?"" ""No, I put it there to make the pen look old; you see a fox can easily step on that bunch of dry leaves that are on the pan of the trap from the bank. A fox does not like new things. You see this trap is set for mink, coon or fox, whichever may happen along."" ""What is the trap fastened to?"" ""See that limb that has moss all grown over it. The trap is stapled to it."" ""Can't a fox or coon drag it away?"" ""Yes, but not far. See the chain is stapled about the middle of the limb, and the animal would not go far before it got fast. ""Fred, you get that rabbit out of the knapsack that we took out of the snare, and we will put some fresh bait in the pen for this is getting too stale; mink and coon do not like rotten meat. Cut it into several pieces so that the animal can not get it all at once. There, that is all right, and let us hurry on to the next trap. Here it is and a mink in it and drowned."" ""Where is the pen? I do not see it."" ""We do not always have a pen. You see that notch in that log where the water runs over? That is where the trap was set. See this hay wire that is fastened to the trap chain and which is fastened to that stone out in the deep water? The mink could not go toward the bank so it went into the deep water and was drowned."" ""Why did you set a double spring trap here?"" ""Well, Fred, an otter might happen along and that is just the place to catch it. You see above the log I have fixed to gage the water as at the other trap. I do this so the water will not wash the covering from the trap, or get so deep over the trap that the animal will not spring it when going over it."" ""I see that you have got those brush on either side of the trap with just enough space for the animal to pass through over the trap."" ""That is correct, you are catching on, Fred, all right."" ""Don't you use bait where you set a trap in this way?"" ""Not often; sometimes I fasten a fish with a horse-hair with a hook fast to it so that you can hook it to the lower jaw and fasten it in the water just above the trap; water keeps it moving and attracts the animal. We have got this trap set all right and will now move on to the next. We will take the mink to the next trap before skinning it."" ""What is that over yonder on the other side of the creek?"" ""That is a coon and it is in a trap. Fred, you take my cane and kill it while I fix up the bait pen, for it has torn things up as bad as a bear would."" ""Why did you not use stones to build this pen?"" ""Old chunks are just as good and much handier to get, and there was plenty of moss on the old logs near to cover it with."" ""Why do you not use old bushy limbs here?"" ""You see this trap sets in the mouth of a small spring run; we will cut some little twigs and stick them up in the ground, in place of the brush, to make the runway, as we call it. We will now skin the mink. Rip straight down the hind leg from the heel to the vent. Now lay the knife down and start the skin loose on the legs with the thumb and finger; work the skin down the leg to the root of the tail then take knife and cut the skin loose around the vent working the skin free around the roots of tail until you can get your fingers of the left hand around the tail bone. Now with the right hand near the body of the mink pulling with the right and you will strip the tail clean from the bone. With the knife make a slit on either fore leg about one inch from the heel and around the leg. You are now ready to strip the skin down the body to the fore legs and with the thumb and finger work the leg out. Strip the skin down to the ears and with the knife cut the ears close to the head, continue to strip the skin down to the eyes, cut around the eyes close to the bone and use the knife on down to the end of nose. That was a short job. Now we will put this mink carcass in the back end of the pen and cut the balance of the rabbit up and put it in the pen back about six inches from the trap."" ""Don't you use any scent; I have heard people say that you use some kind of scent?"" ""I use none, only of the animal itself. It did not take long to take the pelt off that coon; we will strip some of that fat from the carcass and do it up in the skin and put it in the knapsack; hang the carcass up on that sapling. We must be moving now. Our next trap is a bear trap; it sets up in that little sag you see and in a spring that comes out of the side of the hill. I like to set traps in those springs for they never freeze up and the bait keeps much longer. No, there is nothing in it, I can see the clog there all right. Yes, there is something in it; it is a coon and it is dead. Look, there is a fox in a trap."" ""Where was the trap set, I do not see any bait pen?"" ""Fred, you take this stick and walk up slowly to him; go up close and give him a sharp blow across the back of the neck--that will fix him. You see that big mossy log laying on the bank over there? That was where he was caught. We will now set the trap again. See this little sink in the log? That is where the trap was set; this limb is what the trap was fastened to, one end on the ground and the other comes just up to the log where the trap is set and we will staple the trap to it. We will now cover it with moss, just like on this log, but we will get it from another log. No one could tell that there was a trap there."" ""Will not the fox smell it?"" ""He might if it was not for this fox carcass. We will skin the fox, just as we did the mink. Look out there Fred, do not disturb the moss or anything on that log where the trap is. Keep away from that. We will put this carcass in the little hollow and will drive a crotched stake straddle of its neck; drive it well down; now take this stick and rake some leaves over it, cover the neck where the stake is quite well, the rest of the carcass only slightly. You have done it very well and the fox will not notice what scent there is on the trap as long as that carcass is there."" ""But you had no carcass there when you caught this one and I have heard that a fox was afraid of the scent of iron?"" ""That is all bosh. Keep your traps free from all foreign scent and you need not be afraid of the scent of the iron, but if you catch some animal in the trap, then you should have some of the scent of that animal around near the trap, this will overcome what scent there is on the trap. This, however, is only necessary with shy animals like the fox. Coon and skunk are not afraid of what they smell."" ""Do you ever wear gloves when setting your traps?"" [Illustration: LOG SET FOR FOX.] ""No, that is all nonsense. Get the clamps out of the knapsack and we will set the bear trap. We set the trap this way so that the bear goes in lengthways of the jaws, not crosswise of them. We will now place the trap in this hole that we have dug out, so that the water will be deep enough to cover the trap and be sure that the jaws rest firmly on the ground, so that if the bear should step on the jaws, the trap would not tip up. Some trappers do not do this and then they think that the shy animal turned the trap over. We will now cover the trap with those water soaked leaves after which we will take this piece of moss as large as your hand, and with this forked stick put the moss on it, and place it on the pan of the trap."" ""Would the bear smell it, if you put it on with your hands?"" ""No, but if the trap should accidentally spring it would be better to catch the stick than your hand. Now we will cut this coon carcass into two or three pieces and put it back in the bait pen about three feet from the trap. There we have it fixed all right. We will now go over the ridge to where there is another bear trap set and will eat our lunch as we go along."" ""How did you know that a fox would go on that log where that trap was set?"" ""By knowing the nature of the animal. When the fox smelled the bear bait in the pen there, I knew that he would get on the highest point near the pen to investigate and that point was that log."" ""Is this the only way you catch foxes?"" ""No, that is only one of the many ways. Here we are; the trap is right down in the head of this hollow; that is a dark place down there, yes, that is the kind of a place that bears like to travel through. I can see the pen, but I do not see the clog. Yes, the clog is gone, I guess that Bruin has put his foot in it this time. Now go still and look sharp and see if we can find him anywhere for a bear will try hard and get away when they first see you. He has gone this way, see how he has torn down the brush and has turned up those old logs. He will not do that long and after a little we may be obliged to circle in places to find the trail. Here he has gone up this steep side hill but he will not go far that way. See how he has torn this old tree top up and gnawed those logs and those trees, he has been past here. He has gone straight back down the hill. Now he will keep along this side hill, for he may cross this hollow back and forth three or four times before we find him fast. Here is the trail again, he has gone back up the hill. We will work up the hill so as to keep on the highest ground."" ""You have followed these bear trails a good many times, haven't you?"" ""Yes, in 1900 I followed one seven days that broke the chain and went up with the trap, and then another party ran across the bear and killed it. I did not even get my trap back. They said they hung the trap up in a tree and some one stole it."" ""Hold on Fred, what is that away down there in the hollow?"" ""That is the bear, he is trying to climb that tree, I do not think he will make it, for the clog is fast between those two small saplings that stand by the large tree. We will go a little closer, there now! when he turns his head sideways take good aim and put the ball square in the ear. A good job, Fred, he never knew what hurt him. Now make a slit in the skin, right at the point of the breast bone, and then stick him as you would a hog. Do not cut the skin too much. Now Fred get the clamps out of the knapsack and we will see if we can get him out of the trap. Now we will skin him as you would a beef with the exception, we will leave the claws on, for the skins are a much better price where the feet are left. We will be very careful not to cut the hide, for they skin about as mean as a hog does. Well now we will hang the foreparts up in this tree and take the skin and the saddles and pull for camp."" ""Are you not going to set the trap?"" ""No, it will be dark before we get to camp now and we have got a heavy load to carry, in fact, if it was anything but bear, we would think we could not carry it."" ""My, but this is getting heavy."" ""Yes, Fred, but this all goes in with trapping and besides it will improve the appetite."" ""I guess so, for I am as hungry as a wolf."" ""Well, here we are at camp. Fred, you will find the lamp on that shelf close up in the corner. You light it while I start the fire. Now Fred you will find the key to the camp chest behind that ridge post. Open the chest and take the blankets out so that they will be airing. Now in the other part of the chest you will find some tin cups, plates, knives and forks, also some crackers, cheese and ginger snaps. The cheese is done up in waxed paper. You can put those things on the table while I go to the spring and get a pail of water. Now, Fred, you raise that lid and you will find a box sunk down in the ground, where you will find potatoes and bacon. Get some out. You will find the coffee in a sack in the chest and the coffee pot is hanging on that nail. You put the coffee on while I get the potatoes."" ""Oh, we cannot wait for potatoes to cook."" ""Yes, we can, I will pare three or four and slice them up and put them in the spider with a little water and some bits of pork and by the time the coffee boils, the potatoes will be ready. Fred, just hand me that lid so I can cover these potatoes over. You will find a can of condensed milk and the sugar in the chest. Please set them on the table while I fix the fire."" ""You have plenty of good dry wood."" ""Yes, I always come over to the camp before the trapping season begins and cut up a good lot of wood. And those old elevated stove ovens make the best kind of a stove for a camp. Fred, you pour the coffee while I take the potatoes up and we will partake of this frugal meal. In the morning for breakfast we will have bear steak, boiled partridge and buck-wheat cakes."" ""Well Fred, I feel better, how is it with you?"" ""Oh, I feel like a fighting cock now, but I was too hungry for anything. Well Fred, the dish water is hot in that pan on the stove, if you will wash the dishes, I will stretch those skins and dress those partridges. Now if you will spread the blankets on the bunk, I will mix the cakes for breakfast, and then we will be ready for bed."" ""How large is this camp?"" ""The logs were cut fourteen and sixteen feet long, so that makes it about twelve by fourteen on the inside. The roof is good and steep. Yes, I like a ridge roof and half pitch them, you do not have to make the body so high. Yes, I always chunk well and calk good with moss before I mud it, then you have a good warm camp. Yes, I like to have a 12 x 20, two small sash in each gable."" ""Does that roof leak?"" ""No, a roof put on with good hemlock bark like that will not leak and will last a long time. Fred we must bunk down for we must be moving early in the morning."" ""Come, Fred, turn out, I have breakfast about ready."" ""Why it is not morning, is it?"" ""Yes, it is six o'clock and we must be moving as soon as we can see, for we have a big day's work before us. Yes, Fred, everything tastes good in the woods. I suppose a keen appetite has something to do with that. Well, it is light, so that we can see to travel, so we will be going. Yes, Fred, you can come over with me again and I will show you how to set traps, many different ways, to catch different animals, and we might have a bear in a pen."" ""Do you catch bear in a pen?"" ""Yes, and I like a pen for a bear better than a steel trap. No getting away if the pen is properly made."" ""Well, here is the bear trap and there has been a wild cat at work at those inwards, so you see I did not bring that trap along for nothing. Fred, you place a few of those bushy limbs around on the upper side of those inwards, while I set the trap. There, that is all right, we will staple to this limb. Yes, he will be quite likely to get into the trap if he comes again, for he can't get at the bait very well from any other way, only over the trap."" ""How far is it from where the bear trap was set?"" ""About one-half mile. Yes, I suppose he dragged that trap three or four miles to get that distance. Here we are, it will not be a long job to set that trap as he has not torn the bait trap down. Fred, you get the clamps from the knapsack, while I cut that bushy tree for a clog. Yes, we let those limbs stick out about ten inches so that they will catch in the brush and on logs, and that bothers, you see. Yes, those lungs and liver are all right for bait as long as it is fresh. A bear does not like tainted meat. Well, that is all right now, we will go to camp and get a bite to eat, and then pull for home and get the horse and wagon and come out and take the bear meat and the skin in. Yes, we always ship the saddles to New York, they bring a good price. ""Yes, it is more of a knack to stretch a bear skin right than any other skin. Here we are at camp again, we will eat a bite and then pull for home. Good bye, Fred, yes, you shall go again."" CHAPTER IX. Bears in 1870, To-Day--Other Notes. One not familiar with the conditions of a wild woods life would naturally think that bears would diminish in proportion to deer and wild animals. However, this does not seem to be the case. Forty years ago, trappers of bear were not as numerous as at the present time. People at that time, hunted more for profit than sport and their forte was the slaughter of deer. In those days it was nothing uncommon to see sleigh loads of deer pass every day on the way to market. After the first tracking snows of the season, the deer killed in this county (Potter) were hauled by team thirty and forty miles to the nearest railroad station and shipped to New York and Philadelphia but this is not what we wish to write of. We only speak of this to show that the man of forty years ago was of the trail, rather than the trap line. Forty years ago, the writer was acquainted with nearly every hunter and trapper who made a business of hunting or trapping in this and adjoining counties. Men who made a business of trapping bear as well as hunting deer could be counted on the fingers of your hands, and the grounds on which they operated were the counties of Clinton, McKean, Cameron and Potter. The names of these men who perhaps were the most interested in bear trapping in the section above mentioned were, Leroy Lyman, Horatio Nelson, Lanson Stephan, Isaac Pollard, Ezery Prichard and one or two others, including the writer. The traps mostly used were bear pens and deadfalls. It was considered a fairly good day's work for two men to build one good bear pen or two good deadfalls. Most bear trappers, however, had a few steel bear traps for it may be said that nearly every country blacksmith knew how to make a bear trap and how to temper a trap spring. This cannot be said of the average blacksmith of the present day. Bear forty years ago would migrate then as they do now. We used to think that bear would travel from the Virginias and from Northern New York if not from the New England States to Pennsylvania or from Pennsylvania north or south as the case may be. This was proven from the fact that if there was a good crop of mast in one locality, while a scarcity in another, the bear would all seem to be moved north or south as the case may be as though they had some way of informing one another where plenty of food was to be found. At such times when bear are on a migratory tramp it is not an uncommon thing to find a bear track near your house or barn on going out in the morning when there was snow on, so that the track is plain to be seen. This was no uncommon thing forty years ago, neither is it at the present time (1910) when there is a general scarcity of forage crops such as beech nuts, chestnuts and acorns. I have seen it stated by some writers that at certain times bear will move in a drove and at such times it was not safe for a man to meet a bear for they were very dangerous and would attack any one who chanced to be in their way. In my upwards of fifty years experience of woods life, I do not call to mind of ever seeing more than three bears on one trail at the same time and these were an old bear and cubs. It has been the writer's observation that when bears were on these migratory trips in search of food or from other cause, they travel singly and not in droves or even in pairs. During the summer when bears are existing on nettles, wild turnips, berries and other green food, it is not out of the ordinary to find a bear in pretty close proximity to the farm house and close around the fields where he can occasionally get a sheep or lamb. I have seen and heard much written and said of bear raising from their hind feet to attract people's attention who chanced to come in their way when in the woods. I have never seen a bear raise on his hind feet for battle, in any case, when a hunter or trapper approaches them. I have often seen them sit upon their haunches to listen when they heard a noise and were not sure of its origin. As to the number of bear at the present time and forty or fifty years ago, through Northern and Central Pennsylvania, there seems to be about as many now as there were then. This I attribute to the fact that much of the country in other localities has been cleared up and thus deprived bruin of his natural haunts. Forty years ago,--in the early 70's--it was customary then as now, to keep tab on trappers as to what they were doing along the trap line. Trappers of years ago would average from three to twelve bears, according to how plenty they were and to what the condition of the weather was. It often happens that when bear are plenty on the trapper's trapping grounds, he does not have the best of luck in taking the game. If shack is very plentiful it is sometimes difficult to get the bear to take ordinary bait. The bear will also den up or go into hibernation much quicker if they get fat, than they will if shack is a little scarce so that they do not get quite so fleshy. If the bears get real fleshy early in the season they will den up at the approach of the first cold and freezing weather and sleep until spring. On the other hand, if the bear continues to be a little lean, as he generally is during the summer, he will continue to search for food during quite severe weather. They will leave winter quarters and come out in search of food when there are a few warm days, or a slight thaw, which they will rarely do if they go into the den in good flesh. The bear is not like the raccoon. Their rutting season in this latitude is in August and not in February and March as with the raccoon and groundhog. Now all of these conditions has much to do with the number of bears that a trapper may get during a season. The number of bear taken in Pennsylvania by the average trapper at the present time and forty years ago may be slightly less now than then but the difference is not great. There are more bear trappers today than forty years ago. During the months of October and November, 1909, there were nearly one hundred bears caught in traps and killed with dogs in the above counties mentioned. Bears were more plentiful through this section than usual this season, although they did not work north into the beech timber until about the first of November, owing to a heavy crop of chestnuts and acorns farther south. Comrades of the trap line, if I was in a section of country where large game was as plentiful as it was here fifty years ago, I would not be able to get very far into tall timber, but as it gets monotonous to write of skunk, muskrat and rabbit hunting of to-day, I will tell of some of my experiences of fifty years ago, when it was my custom to hunt deer and bear for profit and pleasure. In those days I made it a point to be in the woods with my bear traps and rifle by the middle of October each year, if health permitted. In those days all that a trapper and hunter had to do was to get a few miles out into tall timber, build a good log cabin and hit a permanent job for the season. Deer, bear and fur-bearing animals were so plentiful that it only required a small territory to find game sufficiently plenty to keep the trapper on a lively gait all the time. In those days we made it more a specialty of hunting deer for the profit there was in it. We had built our cabin on the divide between the headwaters of the Cross fork of Kettel Creek and the headwaters of the East Fork of the Sinnamahoning. I had built a few deadfalls and bear pens for bear and also had three or four steel bear traps set, but beech-nuts, chestnuts and other nuts were so plentiful that the bear would not take meat bait and I had no other bait at hand. The bear would pass within a few feet of a trap and pay no attention to the bait. Now at this time, furs were so low that there was but little to be made from the sale of the pelts of the fox, mink, skunk, etc. But it was my custom to carry one or two steel traps in my pack sack and when I killed a deer, I would make a set or two for the fox, marten or fisher, whichever happened along first. As I have stated I spent the greater part of my time in deer hunting. On this particular day I was following a drove of four or five deer, but the wind was so unsteady and whirling about in puffs so that as near as I could get to a deer was to see his white flag, beckoning me to come on as they jumped a log or some other object. Striking the trail of a bear that had gone back and forth several times, nearly in the same place within the past three or four days, since a light snow had fallen, I was satisfied that it was a bear going back and forth from his lodging quarters to his feeding grounds. So I left the trail of the deer and took up the trail of the bear, taking the track that I thought had been made last. I did not follow the trail far, which led along the brow of the ridge, when I saw that the several different bear tracks were forming into one trail and making in the direction of several large hemlock trees that had been turned out by the roots and lay in a jumbled up mess. I followed the trail carefully until I was certain that the bear had entered the jungle of timber. Here I worked carefully around the jam of timber until sure that the bear was in the jungle and that it would be impossible for me to get near the bear. The density of brush and undergrowth was such that I would drive the bear out before I could get close enough to Bruin to get a shot at him. And this was a time, when I longed for a pard. Being convinced that I could do nothing alone, I got out on one side of the trail the bear had made in going back and forth and watched until dark, in hopes that Bruin would come out on his way to his feeding grounds. But in this I was mistaken so was obliged to give up the hunt for the time being and make tracks for the shanty. My camp was about five or six miles from Edgcomb Place, this being the nearest point to where anyone lived, where I might get help to rout Bruin. The Edgcomb Place was a sort of a half way house, it being about fourteen miles either way to a settlement. The stage made one trip a week over this road and stopped at Edgcomb Place for dinner and often some one would come out from town in the stage and stop there for a few days' hunt. It was one of these parties that I was in hopes of getting to help me out in this bear hunt. I started in the morning before daylight as the stage had gone the Kettel Creek way the day before, which was in my favor of catching help at the hotel. As good luck proved to be on my side, I found a man at the hotel by the name of John Howard, who was stopping there for a few days' hunt. He was more than anxious to join me in the bear hunt. We hastened back to camp so as to get onto the job as quickly as possible. We got to the shanty about noon and got a hasty lunch and started out to wake Bruin up if he was still sleeping where I had left him. When we got to the jam of timber, we found that he had been to his feeding grounds and had returned to his lodging apartments during the night, so we now thought that we would soon make sure of our game. We located the spot the best we could where we thought Bruin was sleeping and began to cautiously work our way in from opposite sides. It only took a short time to work our way into the jam sufficiently to locate a large root, where Bruin's tracks showed plainly that he was sleeping under this root. We continued to work our way up closer to the root with gun in hand for ready action. But still Bruin did not show up, neither could we hear the least bit of a noise from him. When we were within a few feet of the root, Mr. Howard on one side and the writer on the other side, suddenly, without any warning whatever, Bruin came out of his hole like a shot out of a gun and nearly landed on Mr. Howard, who sprang backwards to escape him. Mr. Howard's feet became tangled in the thick brush, he fell backwards and before he could regain his feet, Bruin had gone over the brow of the ridge, into the laurel out of sight. Mr. Howard was not able to get in a shot at Bruin, as I was on the other side of the root and on higher ground, I managed to empty both barrels of my rifle at him through the thick brush, but Bruin went on down the hill, through the laurel, apparently unhurt. After following the trail of Bruin for some distance, we began, now and then, to find a little blood, where the bear had crawled over a log or rubbed against the laurel. We followed him until we found one or two places where he had broken down a few laurel and scratched about in trying to make a bed, so we thought the better plan was to let Bruin go for the night and let him make his bed. But we did not go to camp empty handed for good luck favored Mr. Howard in killing a good, big deer on our way to the shanty. After leaving the trail of the bear, we followed up a spur of the main ridge that led to camp, Mr. Howard going up one side of the spur while I took the other spur. Just before reaching the top of the spur, I heard Mr. Howard shoot and in a few minutes I heard him shouting for help. When I got across the ridge to where he was, I found him dressing a good sized buck. As it was getting dark we lost no time in taking the entrails out of the deer, cutting a withe with a hook, which we hooked into the lower jaw of the deer. We hooked ourselves to the withe and made lively tracks to the shanty, where we could talk and laugh of the day's hunt. * * * We were up early the next morning and had our lunch packed in our knapsack, ready for an early start. It had turned warm during the night and the light snow that was on the ground, was fast disappearing. So we lost no time in getting back to where we had left Bruin's track the night before. We could still manage to follow the trail on the snow and we soon found where Bruin had broken down a few laurel and tried to make a bed. But he would not stop long, apparently, when he would move on for a short distance and again break down a few laurels as before to make a nest. We could see a little more blood at each place where he stopped than the one before. We were working the trail as cautious as we could, when we heard a noise in the thick laurel to our left and got a glimpse of Bruin going through the laurel. We emptied both barrels of our guns in the direction where we could see the brush wiggle, but all of our shots failed to take effect. Bruin now left this laurel patch, crossed a ravine and began to climb another spur of the main ridge. We did not follow the trail long, when we discovered that it was becoming hard work for Bruin to travel far at a time, as he would stop to rest. The snow was now gone so that it was a little more difficult to follow the trail of the bear. We thought that it would be better for one of us to go up the ravine to the top of the ridge and stand about where he thought that the bear would come out at the top of the ridge. Mr. Howard went to the ridge, while I was to follow the bear's trail. After waiting long enough to give Mr. Howard time to get to the top of the ridge, I took up the trail of the bear. I had not gone far when I came to a bed, where the bear had stopped for a time. I was now sure Mr. Howard would get to his watching place before the bear reached the top of the hill. I was not mistaken, for it was not long until I heard Mr. Howard fire both barrels of his gun in rapid succession. I thought when I heard the two shots that the bear hunt was surely over, but after listening a few moments and hearing nothing from Mr. Howard I was then unable to give a guess what he had done. I worked along on the trail until near the top of the hill when I saw Mr. Howard standing with head down and bearing the expression of a motherless colt. When I got up to him he said that the bear had stopped near the brow of the ridge and when he came in sight, the bear started across the ridge and he fired both barrels of his rifle at him but the bear was so far away that he could not reach him. The bear now crossed the ridge in the direction of Windfall Run, a branch of the Cross Fork and toward a large windfall. We followed the bear a short distance in to the windfall. Briers and brush were so thick that it was almost impossible to work our way along in the brush and one could scarcely see ten feet ahead. We had followed the trail but a short distance when we could hear Bruin whining like a little puppy and soon we could see him sitting up on his haunches and keeping up the whine. We soon put an end to his troubles. When we removed the bear's entrails, we found that one of the shots that we fired at him at the beginning of the hunt, had passed through the lungs but had not struck any large artery or any vital point. But the wound had weakened him so that he was no longer able to make his way through the thick briars and brush. We had two days of sport but now the real work began. We were about three miles from camp and any hunter who has toted a three hundred pound bear or a good big deer, lashed to a pole and where the route was up and down steep hills, knows what sort of a job he has on his hands. But comrades, we were not as old at that time as we now are and we could tote a bear or deer as easy then as we could a rabbit now. [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS CATCH, FALL 1904.] Mr. Howard stayed with me for about two weeks and we had other bear hunts and killed two other bear and we did it almost without knowing that there was a bear within ten miles of us. We also got five or six deer during Mr. Howard's stay with me. Deer were as plentiful in those days as rabbits. Comrades, look over the accompanying picture and note the difference at the camp of a trapper from what you can imagine it was about one's hunting camp at the time we write of. CHAPTER X. Incidents Connected with Bear Trapping. Several years ago, I was trapping for bears on the East Fork of the Sinnemahoning River. I usually went on horse back as far as I could when tending the traps. But boys, don't be bad, as I was, for this was on Sunday that I went to look at the traps. I found the bait-pen of the first one torn down, bait gone and everything showed plainly that Bruin had been there. As I had no bait at hand, I went to the next trap. I found things quite different, for the old bear had surely ""put his foot in it"" this time, as the trap was gone. On taking the trail I did not follow it far, before I found bruin fast in an old tree-top. I soon dispatched him and taking off his coat, hung up his carcass. Now the bait was gone at this trap also. Let me tell you that this is something that rarely happens, for when the bear puts his foot in a Newhouse trap, he seldom tarries to monkey with bait. I suspected that another bear had been there after this one had got in the trap. As I had no bait I took the lungs and heart of the one I had caught and baited the traps the best I could, then I took the skin and started for home. Well, when I got near the horse you can bet there was some tall prancing and loud snorting. After a long time I managed to get on his back and home with the skin. The next morning I began to have some doubt whether bears were cannibals or not. I thought I would take some fresh bait and go back and bait the traps up good. When I got near the trap in which I had caught the bear the day before, I heard a great deal of wrestling going on and it did not take long to see that I had an old he-bear hung up this time. And now was the time that I began to realize what a boy's trick I had cut up, for I had not taken any gun with me; only a small revolver and three cartridges. I found that the bear was dead fast and a big one too. He seemed to be more inclined to quarrel than bears usually are. I took my trapping hatchet in one hand and revolver in the other, and worked my way up close as I dared and awaited the best chance I could get to shoot for he was rolling and tumbling like a ball. I fired at his head but missed it. I fired the two remaining cartridges just back of the fore-shoulders. He paid about as much attention to it as I imagine he would if it had been a flea that bit him. After waiting some time to see what effect the shots would have and noticing no change in Bruin's countenance, I concluded I would see what I could do with a club. I soon found that I and the club were not ""in it,"" so I gave it up as a bad job and went home after the team and a gun. On my way home I had to pass the house of an old trapper by the name of Stevens. Of course, he was out to see what luck I had, and when I told him my story, he gave a great laugh and said he would go and let the bear out of the trap. When we got back to the trap the next day we found the fight all gone out of Bruin, for the two shots had penetrated the lungs and he was nearly dead. * * * Pard, whom I call Co, and I went camping many years ago on a branch of the Susquehanna River in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. At that time all that part of the country was an unbroken wilderness and we were several miles from the nearest town. Now Co was a good hunter but despised trapping, saying it was no gentleman's sport, yet he was always ready to do his share in camp life. One evening in December Co did not turn up at dark, the usual hour for his return, still I did not worry much until eight o'clock, but from that time until about nine I kept going to the door and giving an occasional ""Kho-Hoop,"" just to let him know the direction of the camp if he was within ear shot. As Co did not return, about nine o'clock I shouldered my rifle and started out in the direction that he had gone, shooting off my gun, and occasionally letting out a shout that echoed from hill to hill, but no answer came back in reply. The weather was growing extremely cold and I began to feel very much worried about Co for although I knew he was a good woodsman, I imagined all sorts of calamities had befallen him. At every high point I would fire my gun but never an answer could I hear. I kept this up till midnight, and then retraced my steps to camp intending to take an early start in the morning, when I could see to track my wandering partner. Judge of my delight, when about half a mile from camp the sharp report of a rifle rang out on the clear night air, and I knew Pard had returned alive. I hastened to the shanty where I found Co all right but as mad as a hornet. As he raved around he exclaimed: ""No one but a--fool would catch anything in a--steel trap. If you must trap things, get them in something that will stay put."" When Co cooled off a little, I said: ""Come old man, tell us what has happened."" ""What has happened,"" said he, ""enough has happened, I should think. I went where you set that tarnal old bear trap and some critter has got into it and broken the chain and carried it off, and he makes a track bigger than an elephant. He's making for the big windfall and I followed him more than forty miles, and he was farther ahead of me than when I started, and I hope he will get into the old windfall and stay there till doomsday."" Well, Pard felt better when he had eaten the hot supper I had left for him and we turned in for a few hours' sleep. The next day we went to town and got a number of men and dogs and the following morning started out early on the track of old bruin. We soon struck the trail and located the beast in a big ravine. Stationing the men around where the bear was likely to break cover, I went in with the dogs to drive him out. Now there was one young chap among the crowd called Dan, who proved to be of rather a timid nature. The battle which soon followed proved very short owing to the number of guns opened on the bear the moment he broke cover and he was soon dispatched and nearly as soon skinned and cut up. But when I looked for Dan he was nowhere to be found. A searching party was organized and after beating the bush for some time, poor, frightened Dan was finally located in the top of a small beech tree and came tumbling down inquiring if the bear was ""sure dead."" * * * I have often thought I would like to relate some of my experiences in the woods while deer hunting. Many a time while following a herd of deer or a wounded one over ridge after ridge, has the sun set and the stars come out and I found myself many miles from my cabin or any habitation. Then I would find a large fallen tree, that laid close to the ground, gather a pile of dry limbs and bark, scrape away the snow from the log, often the snow being a foot deep, build a fire where I scraped the snow away. When the ground became thoroughly warm, I would rake the coals and brands down against the log, put on more wood, and then I would place hemlock boughs on the ground, where I had previously had the fire. Soon they would begin to steam and after frizzling some venison (if I chanced to have it) before the fire I would take off my coat, lie down on my stomach, pull the coat over my head and shoulders and sleep for hours before waking. Sometimes I would have the skin of a bear to put over me, and for doing these things my friends would scold me, but the reader will know, if he has the blood of a hunter in him, that I enjoyed it. But this is not what I started to write about, it was of a day's hunt after a bear on the 16th day of December, 1903. On the day previous, the afternoon sun sinking to rest in the west, casts its rays for a moment upon a solitary hunter's cabin in the hills of old Potter, then the bright glows faded away, the sun disappeared behind the mountains and it was a soft beautiful twilight, while I stood just outside the cabin door meditating. Mart (that is an old liner who had come to my cabin to have a few days' hunt) came out of the cabin and I said, ""old man, what are you thinking about?"" The reply was, ""just watching the sun set."" ""Don't you think the coon will be out tonight if it holds warm?"" ""I don't know what the coon will do, but I know we went around a bear over in that jam in Dead Man's Hollow. (This hollow is so called because a fisherman a few years ago, found the body of a man who had gotten lost and died in the snow the winter before). Well what do you think you will do about it? I think we had better turn in early so as to get an early start in the morning and see if we can find where the bear is sleeping. ""Agreed,"" said Mart, and we were soon in bed, but it was a long time before I closed my eyes in sleep for I was familiar with the woods in the neighborhood where the bear was supposed to be and I mapped out and laid every plan that was to be carried out the next day before I went to sleep. At four o'clock in the morning we were astir and soon breakfast was ready and eaten, lunch put up and at the break of day we were on our way to where bruin was supposed to be, a distance of about five miles, which is no small job for an old cripple like myself. After about three hours we were on the ground where we were in hopes of finding bruin. Mart was to circle several points outside of where we thought the bear was snoozing; this was done to make sure that the bear was in there. I took a position where the bear was most likely to come out if he was there and should be started by Mart. My position was in an open piece of timber on the point of a hill and near a very thick jam of trees that had been broken down two years before by a heavy ice storm and near the bear track where he had gone in several days before. Mart was to make another circle somewhat smaller than the one he had previously made for we now knew that the bear was in the jam of timber. After completing the second circle Mart was to drop below the jam where we were quite sure bruin was napping and work his way through the fallen timber. This worked all right, for soon I heard Mart cry out: ""Look out, he is coming."" Soon I heard the crashing of the brush and could tell that bruin was coming directly toward me, and in another minute he broke into the open timber. My rifle was already pointed in that direction and bruin had scarcely made two jumps in the open timber when I fired. The bear made a loud noise like that of a hog and I knew that he was hit hard and could already see a crimson streak in the snow. But bruin steadily held his course, in a few yards further he made an attempt to jump a large fallen tree and I fired again. This shot was more fatal than the first, and he fell to the ground and could not rise. I hurried up and fired a shot through his head which soon quieted him. Mart was soon on the scene and after a little rejoicing we soon had his hide off, and cutting the fore parts off and hanging them in a tree to be brought out the next day. Mart took the saddles and I the skin and started for camp, which we reached shortly before dark, and as we had prepared things for supper before leaving in the morning, supper was soon ready which consisted of buckwheat cakes, wild honey, baked potatoes, bacon, bear steak and tea. Dear readers, do not tell Mart, but I think that he took a hot toddy after talking the hunt over and over. Again, we laid down to rest our weary selves and dream of the hunt which may never come. CHAPTER XI Pacific Coast Trip. As I am always looking for taller timber to plant my traps in and as the drift of the trapper seems to be to the west, the Rockies and the Pacific Coast, and as I have had some experience in the Rockies, and along the Pacific Coast region, I will speak of some of the advantages and disadvantages that the trapper will meet with in that section. The trapper will find the fur bearers more plentiful and many more kinds of animals to take, than is found in the East, which is a great advantage to the trapper. The hunter will find deer quite plentiful in many places in the Rocky Mountains and on the Pacific Coast. In 1904 I was in Humboldt and Trinity Counties, California and I found deer so plentiful and tame that it was no sport to shoot them. While the law limited the hunter to two deer in a season, the people in the mountains made their own laws, as to the number of deer that they should kill. Black and brown bear are plentiful all through the Rocky Mountains and in the Coast ranges. You see much written of the grizzly bear in this region, but it is doubtful if a hunter or trapper would see one or even the track of one during a whole season's trapping. The trapper will find marten, fisher and lynx in many places in the Rockies and in the Coast Range but nothing to what there was a few years ago. Now one who is contemplating trapping in the Rockies or on the Pacific Coast, must bear in mind that the conditions that a trapper meets with in this region are far different from what they are in the East. The trapper who is planning a trip in that section before starting out should examine his feet close to see that there are no tender spots on them. The man who makes a success of trapping in this region must be a man who can stand grief and hardships a plenty, for he will run up against it often. He will find the mountain streams hard to get along; he will have but little use for a boat as the streams are rapid and full of boulders. In most cases the trapper will be compelled to take his outfit into the mountains by pack horses, and in many cases it will be necessary for the trapper to be the horse. The trapper to succeed in a financial way must take in a supply of provisions to last at least until the first of June, for it is during April, May and even June that he must do his bear trapping; for the bear holes up or goes into hibernation down in the lower land and does not show up much in the mountains until spring. The trapper must provide himself with a good number of traps of different sizes from the No. 1 for marten to the No. 5 for bear; and that means a whole lot of packing and hard work. He must have at least one pair of snow shoes, and should have an extra pair in case of a mishap, in the way of breakage. One good gun is all that is likely to be needed, and don't load yourself down with a lot of revolvers, hunting knives, etc. A good strong pocket knife is all that I have found necessary, though one should have more than one knife no matter what kind he may use. Here I will say a word as to a gun especially for the trap line. The manufacturers of guns have as yet failed to make it. The Marble Game-Getter comes the nearest to it of any now made, but that is not just to my liking. We would do away with one of the barrels, and have a single barrel, 44 caliber straight cut, with cartridges for both ball and shot with 15 inch barrel, skeleton stock, similar to the Stevens Pocket shot gun. Mind, I am speaking of an arm on purpose for the trap line, and this kind of a gun would do the work and be light to carry. Now the expense for an outfit to go into the mountains for a season's campaign is necessarily a considerable item. It is quite necessary that the trapper has a number of camps on his line at advantageous points, for the trapper cannot cover sufficient territory from one camp to make it pay; besides, a number of camps on the line will relieve the trapper of much hardship. I mention this matter thinking it might be of some interest to some one whose feet are itching to get into a big game country, and are thinking of only the game, and not of the hardships they are sure to meet with. Another thing that is well for the trapper who is looking for a happy hunting and trapping ground to remember is, that he will no longer find game as plentiful as it once was, in any place that is in any way easily accessible. If the trapper will take into consideration the expense and hardship that one must put up with in going on one of these outings, it might be that he can find quite as much pleasure and profit in looking up a trapping ground nearer home. I will mention one or two places where one can find some sport where it will not require the hardship nor expense, and at the same time will find deer and some other game quite plentiful, with a fair sprinkling of the fur bearers. In Humboldt County, in California, on Redwood River, deer and bear can be found quite plentiful, and there are some marten, fisher and a few lynx, coon, mink, skunk and fox. The fox are mostly grey and you may by chance meet occasionally with a mountain lion. To reach this section the best way is from San Francisco by boat to Eureka, then by rail and wagon. Another section where game and fur bearers are fairly plentiful and of easy access, is in the vicinity of Thompson's Falls, in Northern Montana. But if only a good outing is wanted, that can be had in Pecos Valley, New Mexico. You will not find much to trap other than muskrats and coon on the river and lakes, but they are quite plentiful, especially the latter. You will find coyotes and some grey wolves, and some antelope, which are protected. Duck shooting is good, the climate is mild, only freezing ice the thickness of window glass in the coldest weather, which is all thawed out and gone by ten o'clock. This section is easily reached by rail. * * * In July, 1902, I was spending a few days at Spokane, Wash. Nearly every day I would take an old cane fish pole and go to the river just above the falls and fish for bass. I would shift my post from one point along the bank of the river to another and sometimes I would go out on the boom timbers and fish among the logs. Some days I would get a bass or two, but oftener I got nothing further than the pleasure of drowning a few minnows. Nearly every morning I noticed a man would come down along the bank of the river and go in the direction of the mill. Sometimes he would stop and watch me for a few minutes, and then pass on without saying anything. But one morning he came along when I happened to be sitting close to his path. I looked up and gave the usual morning nod. The gentleman, for such he proved to be, inquired what luck I was having. I replied that I guessed it must be fisherman's luck, for I got but few fish. He replied that he thought that there were very few bass in the dam, as there was so much fishing done there. I was quite sure that he was right from the number of fish I caught, and I could see a number of others scattered about the pond, and some on the logs, some on the boom timbers and some in boats. The next morning I was back at my old post, and this man came along as usual. He stopped, laughed and said that I seemed to have plenty of faith. I replied that the occasion demanded great faith. He inquired if I lived in the city. I told him that I lived in Pennsylvania and was only out in that country to see the sights and get a few fish and a little venison and later might try to get a little fur. He informed me that his name was Nettel (Charles Nettel) that he was a lumber inspector and that he was going to have a vacation the next week. He intended going to the North Fork of the Clearwater on Elk Creek, where he had a camp, and that if I wished to fill up on trout and venison, I had better join him, as he had no one selected to accompany him yet. I said, ""Thank you, I would be pleased to do so,"" as quick as I could, for fear he would change his mind. I now dropped my bass fishing and would drop into the mill where Mr. Nettel was at work and catch a few minutes chat with my new-found friend, as an opportunity would occur, until the time came to go to Mr. Nettel's camp. As I had a complete outfit, including blankets, tin plates, cups, knives, and forks, a takedown or folding stove with the necessary cooking utensils, which I had not yet unpacked, we concluded to take the whole kit along so that if anything had happened at Mr. Nettel's camp we would have a tent as well as the other camp outfit, but we found Mr. Nettel's shack all right. We took a train to near a place called Orofino on the Clearwater River in Idaho where we repacked our outfit, putting it into sacks. We engaged a man with two pack horses to take our plunder to camp which we found to be all right, and I wish to say that this was the farthest up the gulch in the Rockies that I had been at that time. I found my friend all right on the trout question, for trout were so plenty it was no sport to catch them. The next morning after we were in camp we climbed to what Mr. Nettel called the bench, but I thought it was the moon. We had hardly got to the level, or bench, when we say plenty of elk tracks so we followed in the direction in which the fresh trails seemed to lead. We had not gone far when I noticed something moving in the underbrush, which might have been taken for a rocking chair for all that I could tell. We stood still a few moments when three elk came out in sight. We watched them feed for a few minutes, then made a noise like a deer blowing, and the elk stopped feeding, stood and listened and looked about for danger; Mr. Nettel again snorted and the elk trotted off. We now separated a little and began walking across the bench. We had not gone far when I saw two buck deer feeding and shot one of them. Mr. Nettel soon came to me and we took the entrails out of the deer and drew the carcass down to camp where we sure had venison as well as trout. The man who packed our outfit up the gulch for us had a little whiffet dog with him, and in some manner he neglected to take the dog back with him. We were a little worried at first because the man had left the dog with us, but later I at least was pleased that the dog was with us. We had dressed the deer and hung the meat up on trees near the shack. The second night after we had the deer hanging up, along in the night the dog kept growling so that after a time, as the moon was shining, I thought I would get up and see what was worrying the pup. When I opened the shack door the pup lit out like shot from a shovel, and I could see the outline of some animal taking up a tree. I could hear the bark from the tree falling to the ground like hail. Mr. Nettel was still sound asleep, so I said nothing but took my gun and stepped outside the shack. I could see the outlines of something standing on a limb of the tree. I took the best aim I could owing to the dim light and fired. The tree stood on the side of the gulch, which was very steep, and when the gun cracked the object in the tree apparently flew right up the side of the gulch from the tree. The pup gave chase and within fifty yards I could again hear the bark from the tree and soon again I could see the outline of the animal on the tree. I was working along out towards the pup, when Mr. Nettel, close to my side said, ""It is a lion; be careful and take good aim this time and kill him, if you can."" I got up to the tree where I could see the cat fairly fell, and with all the care possible, I fired. The cat lit out from the tree, but this time he went down the hill instead of up, and when he struck the ground it was broadside instead of on all fours. As good luck would have it, I had hit him square through the shoulders. The cat was a little over seven feet long, and Mr. Nettel said that it was not a large lion, but as it was the first one that I had seen then I thought it was longer than a twelve-foot rail. We pulled the cat up to the shack and turned in again. It was only eleven o'clock and Mr. Nettel was soon sound asleep, but I had too much cat excitement for me to do any more sleeping that night. In the morning we skinned the cat, gathered dry leaves and stuffed the skin and had a stuffed cat in camp. Later, we sold the skin to a party for three dollars. We stayed in camp two weeks, feasting on venison, trout, grouse, and other game. Some of the time we spent prospecting for gold, but we failed to strike it rich. At the end of the two weeks allotted Mr. Nettel, he was obliged to return to his work, and I can say that I never spent two weeks' time with more pleasure than I did with the friend I found while fishing for bass. CHAPTER XII. Some Michigan Trips. Owing to the recent fires (1905) in the northern portion of Michigan, which have undoubtedly killed many of the smaller fur bearing animals in that section, has called to mind experiences I had trapping and hunting in both the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of that state. In the fall of 1868 on the first of October, a party of four of us took a boat at Buffalo, New York, and went to Alpena on Thunder Bay, Michigan, where we purchased provisions for a winter's campaign hunting and trapping. We engaged a team to take our outfit up the Thunder Bay River, a distance of about twenty miles, where the road ended. The road was an old lumber road and rather rough over those long stretches of corduroy. We camped at the end of the lumber road the first night and the team returned home the next morning. We took our knapsacks with some blankets and grub and went up the river to find a camping ground to suit our notion. Mr. Jones and myself took the one axe that we carried with us and began clearing a site to build the camp on. Mr. Goodsil and Mr. Vanater went back after more of the supplies, which included another good axe and a crosscut saw. They cut out a road as they returned so that we could drive to camp when it became necessary. At the end of a week we had up a good log cabin, and all was ready to begin to slay the deer and skin the fur bearers. Two of the boys now went down to Alpena to get the mail and send letters home. On the boys' return next day they brought word that we would not be allowed to ship any deer out of the state. This put a wry face on Goodsil and Jones, for deer hunting was their delight. It was not so bad with Vanater and myself, for we could find plenty of sport with the traps and tanning a few deer skins. Vanater was an expert at it, graining the skins in the water and using the brains of the deer and coon oil for tanning and then smoking the skins. We did not kill many deer though they were plentiful, but venison was so cheap in Detroit and other Michigan cities that it did not pay one for the trouble. By the last of October there was quite a fall of snow and Mr. Goodsil, who was a gunsmith, suddenly came to the conclusion that he was neglecting his business at home and we could not persuade him to stay any longer. It was only a few days later when Mr. Jones also concluded that he was neglecting his business and left us. Now I began to wonder if Mr. Vanater or myself would be the next to get the home fever, but knowing the metal Charley was made of, I expected that I would be attacked first. Charley and I being now left alone began building deadfalls for mink, marten, fisher and lowdowns for bear. I will explain that a lowdown is one of those affairs, half pen, half deadfall, which are built by first making a bed of small poles, then placing on this bed notched together the same as for a log house. The logs should be about twelve inches in diameter, and two tiers will make the pen high enough. The space inside the pen is usually made about seven feet long, two feet high and twenty inches wide. The roof is made of poles or small logs pinned to cross logs, the one at the back end of the pen forming a roller hinge. The cover is raised up and fastened with the usual lever and hook trigger, which the bait is fastened to. The bear in order to get the bait goes over the logs into the pen. I wish to say that while this sort of a trap is quickly made, I do not like them, as the bear will rub the fur madly in its struggles, and they are an inhuman sort of an affair at best. [Illustration: BUILDING A BEAR ""LOWDOWN.""] To get back to my story, Charley and I did fairly well in catching mink and marten, but the bear had either migrated or gone into winter quarters. The coon had also gone into winter quarters. The snow was getting quite deep as it was now past the middle of November, and it now proved to be my luck to be left alone in camp. One night when we were coming to camp, we had to cross a stream on a small tree which had fallen across the creek. There were several inches of snow on the log and Charley was carrying a small deer on his back. I was behind him carrying the guns. Charley worked his way carefully across the log but just as he was about to step off the log on the opposite bank he slipped and fell striking his left leg across the log, breaking the bone just above the ankle joint. Fortunately we were only a short distance from camp so that Charley hobbled to camp, using his gun for a crutch. When we got in camp it did not take long to see that the bone was broken. I fixed wood, water and food as convenient as possible for Charley and took a lantern, a lunch in my pocket and started for Alpena, reaching there shortly after daylight the next morning. Engaging a team without any delay we started back to camp. Reaching camp about three o'clock in the afternoon, we found Charley quite comfortable and feeling quite chipper under the circumstances. While the team was eating we fixed both blankets on the straw and a mattress which we had brought for the purpose from town, and fixed things as comfortable as we could. We were soon on our way back to town, which we reached about midnight. The next morning the doctor set the broken limb with but little difficulty. After staying two or three days and making arrangements with a young man to come to camp every Saturday and bring mail and word from Charley, I returned to camp, where I found things all right. While out to town I bought a pair of snow shoes. I had never used them, and for the first few days it was who and who to know which would be on top, myself or the snow shoes. I finally mastered them and found them a great help in getting about in the deep snow. It kept me pretty busy attending to the traps. One night after Charley had been gone about three weeks, on nearing camp, I saw a big smoke coming out of the chimney. I first thought the cabin was on fire, but I soon saw that that was not the case, and knew some one had started a fire. When I got there I saw some one had been there with a team. When I rapped on the door Charley called out, ""Come in, I am running this camp now."" Well, I tell you I was pleased to hear that voice call out, ""Come in."" It was some time before we thought it best for Charley to go out very much, but he could keep camp and I had company. We stayed in camp until the middle of May, thinking that we would have a big catch of bear in the spring, but were disappointed for we only caught three; but we caught quite a lot of coon. We did not trap any for muskrat. My next trip to Michigan was to Kalkaska County, and I had two partners, Moshier and Funk by name, and both were residents of the state. Our camp was on the Manistee River near the Crawford and Kalkaska County line. This trip was some ten or twelve years later than the one previously mentioned, probably 1878. We killed some thirty odd deer, and Mr. Moshier having some friends living down close to the Indiana line, he shipped our venison down to his friend and he sold it for us. I do not know where he sold it but the checks came from a man by the name of Suttell, N. Y. We caught 11 bear during the fall and spring. We caught a good number of mink, coon and fox, also a few marten. I should have said that on my trip on Thunder Bay River we caught several beaver, but on the Manistee we saw no fresh beaver signs but plenty of old beaver dams. We would make an occasional trip on to the Boardman and Rapid Rivers for mink. On Rapid River two or three miles above Rickers Mill was a colony or family of three or four beaver, but we did not try to catch them. My third trip to Michigan was to the Upper Peninsula, in Schoolcraft County. A pard of mine by the name of Ross and myself had a boat made at Manistique, and started the first of September. We poled and rowed the boat up the Manistique River for a distance of about a hundred miles, according to our estimate. The boat was heavily loaded with our outfit, and we were nearly a month making the trip up the river to where we built our camp on a small lake about one-half mile from the main river. We found mink, marten, beaver and coon quite plentiful, but from what I read bear and wolves are more plentiful there now than they were about 1879. At that time there was not a railroad in that section, nor scarcely a tree cut in the northern part of the Upper Peninsula, with the exception of up about the Iron Works where they were cutting timber and burning coke and charcoal. In fact, I found bear more plentiful in Lower Michigan. About the fifteenth of October we had the camp in shape and a big pile of wood cut and piled close to the door. We now began to explore the country for the best sites to set our traps, mostly Nos. 2, 3 and 4, besides seven bear traps, all Newhouse. We would build deadfalls along the line, for we would not set a steel trap only where we were quite sure that we would make a catch. We used the water set mostly for wolves and fox, and of course, for mink and coon. Good springs were not so common where water sets could be made as in Pennsylvania. We could find occasionally a good log crossing where we could get in a set for wolf, but suitable places of this kind were not plentiful. We worked for beaver all we could. We would break a notch in their dams and then set a trap just on the edge of break in water just deep enough so the beaver would spring the trap. It was while trapping here that I learned to make the bait set for beaver. This is to use the kind of wood beaver were feeding on for bait. We caught three or four wolves on the ice close to the bank. Sometimes the ice would settle along the banks and the water would run over the ice too close to the shore and then freeze. This made a good path, or rather place for the wolf to travel. Now, where a spruce or cedar tree would fall into the lake so as to leave a narrow space between the boughs on the tree and the bank, was a good place to set. We would watch the weather and when it began snowing we would go to one of these trees from the ice or water side, cut a notch in the ice, put in some ashes or dry pulverized rotten wood. The notch cut in the ice must be just deep enough to let the trap down level with the surface. The clog was concealed under a bough of the tree. Now, I wish to say that I was never able to catch a timber wolf unless I was able to outwit him, and in order to do this the conditions and surroundings must be perfect for making the set. Where we found good places to make a set of this kind we would place the carcass of a deer several yards from shore out on the ice. This would entice the wolves to come around, and of course increase our chances of making a catch. We were bothered some by having a wolverine follow a line of deadfalls, tear down the bait pen and take the bait, but we did not allow him to do his cussedness long before we would put a trap in the way. We would sometimes have the parts of a deer taken down by a lynx where we had hung up venison so that it would be convenient to use for bear bait. We never objected much about it for we were willing to trade venison for a cat almost any time, for deer were very plentiful. In April, when we were taking up our traps and getting ready to start down the river as soon as the water dropped so that we dare start, we were going onto a stream one day to take up three or four traps that we had set for beaver, our route led us across the point of the ridge. The point faced to the southeast, and the snow was off in spots on this point. When we went over this point in the morning we saw many deer run from these bare spots, so when we came back along in the afternoon we were as careful as possible and kept the highest ground so as to get a good view on this bare point to see how many deer we could count. There were upwards of forty in sight at one time. How I wish I could have had that picture. We did not dare to start down the river until the first of June, on account of the high water. We had been told that there was a camp on the head of the river where they were cutting wood to be burned into charcoal. While we were waiting for the water to drop we took a knapsack of grub and some fishing tackle and started to find the wood choppers' camp, which we did on the second day after leaving camp. We stayed ten or twelve days at this camp, and while there a Frenchman invited me out to a lake two or three miles from their camp and fish for bass. He said he would take along a couple of traps and we would have some rats for breakfast, as we were going to camp at the lake over night. I did not say much about rats for breakfast, as I thought the man was joking. But sure enough, we had rats for breakfast, also plenty of fish. Well, after the man had argued and plead the case of the rats from all points of view, and I had done a good deal of snuffing and smelling, I tasted, yes, I ate a piece of muskrat and I must confess it was of a fine flavor and would be splendid eating if it was not a rat. However, I have not tried any more from that day to this. I prefer partridge, and I have never been in a place where there were as many partridges as there were in Upper Michigan. It is remarkable how long and well one can live on one hundred pounds of flour, twenty-five pounds lard, ten pounds salt and some bacon, (tea and coffee if one thinks he can't get along without it), in a good game and fish country with a good gun and fishing tackle. We started on our return trip down the river on the second day of June. There had not been a man to our camp during this time. We were well satisfied with our catch with one exception, that being bear, as we only got four and they were all rather small. We had a splendid journey on our return trip down the river. We would see deer at almost every turn and once we saw a bear swimming the river. We caught lots of fish, all we could use, with hardly an effort. CHAPTER XIII. Hunting and Trapping in Cameron County, Pa., in 1869. In my last letter on hunting and trapping in Cameron County, I promised to give Bill Earl's and my own experience in hunting in that county the next season. Well the story is not long, as we had our camp already built, we concluded not to go out into the woods until it was time to begin hunting and to put out bear traps. Accordingly on the last day of October we took a man with a team to take our traps, camp outfit and the grub stake to camp. Going by the way of Emporium in that county, we were compelled to stay there over night, the distance being too far to reach camp the first day. At Emporium we purchased what more necessaries we needed, that we had not brought from home. We reached camp the second day about 10 o'clock. When we came in sight of the camp, Bill was walking ahead of the team with an axe cutting out brush here and there as needed. All of a sudden Bill stopped, set down the axe and looked in the direction of the shanty. When I was close enough so Bill could speak to me, he said, ""I be-dog-on if the wicky is not occupied."" I asked, ""What with, porcupines?"" Bill's reply was that he had known porkies to do some dog-on mean work, but he had never known them to build fires. I could now see the shack, and sure enough there was a little smoke curling up from the chimney. Bill said that he hoped that there was no one there that wanted to tarry long, for he was dog-on sorry if that wicky was large enough for two families. We found the shanty occupied alright. There was a sack of crackers set on the table and a pot of tea set in the chimney and a couple of blankets lay on the bunk. After Bill had sized up the contents of the camp, he concluded that the occupants did not intend to stay long, judging from their outfit, but Bill was mistaken. Bill said that he would proceed to clean house at any rate. We had taken in new straw for the bunk, so we threw the old boughs and the other litter outside and burned it and went in for a general house cleaning. Just before dark, two men came in great haste. One rushed into the shack and demanded to know what in h--- does this mean. Bill said, ""nothing, just moving in is all."" Then the spokesman said, ""Do you fellows pretend to own this camp?"" Bill replied that we did, as we did some dog-on hard work building it at least. The one man continued to go on with a great deal of telling what he would do and what he would not, until we had supper ready, when we asked the men to eat with us. The man that had done very little talking readily consented but the other man was still inclined to bully matters, but he finally took a stool and sat up and ate his supper. After supper we learned that they were from near Wellsville, N. Y. We made arrangements for the men to sleep on the floor, or rather on the ground at the side of the bunk. The next morning after breakfast was over, the man who proposed to run things to his own liking said that he did not see any other way but what we would all have to get along together the best way we could in the shanty. This was more than Bill could stand so he opened on the man and said, ""See here, stranger, I am dog-on if a aint willing to do almost anything to be neighborly, but I am dog-on if it don't take a large house for two families to live in, and this shack is altogether too small."" It now began to look as though we were not going to be good neighbors very long, when the man that had but very little to say, up to this time, said, ""See here, Hank, you know that this is not our shanty. I told you that some one would be here and want it,"" and he took his blankets, gun and sack of crackers and started off down the run. After the other man had done some more loud talking, he gathered up the rest of their plunder and started on after his partner with the remark that he would see us again. Bill replied that he would be dog-on pleased to have him come when we were at home. We were a little afraid that they might return and do us some dirt, but they did not. They went farther down the run and built a sort of a shelter out of boughs and pieces of bark where they stayed about two weeks, when they went home, leaving the field to Bill and myself. We put in two days cutting wood and calking and mudding the shanty wherever the chinking and mud had been worked out by squirrels and other small animals. As soon as we had this work done we put in our time setting our bear traps. We also built two bear pens. After we had the bear traps all set, we then began putting out small traps, setting the most of the small steel traps for fox and building more deadfalls and repairing those that we had made the year before for marten on the ridges, and along the creek for mink and coon. After this work was done we gave more time to bear hunting. We had a good deal of freezing weather without much snow for tracking. Being very noisy under foot, we were compelled to hunt for several days by driving the deer, that is, one of us would stand on the runways in the heads of basins or hollows and in the low places on the ridges where it was natural for deer to pass through when jumped up. In going from one ridge to another, we would get a deer in this way nearly every day, and one day we had the good luck to get three bears while driving, an old bear and two cubs. We were also having fairly good luck with the traps. The first snow that fell to make good tracking was a damp one, and hung on the underbrush so much that it was impossible to see but a few yards unless in very open timber. Here I wish to relate an incident that nearly caused my hair to turn white in a very short time. I am not given very much to superstitions or alarmed at unnatural causes, but in this case I will confess that I felt like showing the white feather. I was working my way very cautiously along the side of a ridge and down near the base of the hill in low timber, as that is the most natural place to find deer in a storm of this kind. I had just stepped out of the thicket into the edge of a strip of open timber where I could see for several rods along the side of the hill. I had barely stepped into the open when I caught sight of some object jumping from a knoll to a log where it was partly concealed behind some trees, so that I was unable to make out what it was. I was sure that I had never seen anything like it before, either in the woods or out in civilization. I could get a glimpse of the thing as it would pass between the trees, then it would disappear behind brush or a large tree for a moment, then I would get a glimpse of it as it would move. Sometimes it would appear white and then a fire red. I could see that it was coming in my direction. As I always wore steel gray, or what was commonly known as sheep gray clothing, which is nearly the same color of most large timber, I stepped to a large hemlock tree, leaned close against the tree, set my gun down close to my side and stood waiting to see whether the thing was natural or otherwise. It was not long before I could see that I had been frightened without any real cause, for it was a hunter who had dressed in fantastic array to put a spell on or charm the deer. He had on a long snow white overshirt and had tied a fire red cloth over his hat and a black sash was tied about his waist. I stood perfectly quiet against the tree until the man was within a few feet of me, I could no longer keep from laughing, and I burst out with laughter. The man jerked his gun from his shoulder as he turned in the direction in which I was standing and gazed at me for a moment and then said, ""You frightened me."" I replied that I guessed that he was no more frightened than I was when I first caught sight of him. Well the man explained that he always dressed in that manner when the underbrush was loaded with snow, as the deer would stand and watch him with curiosity until he was within gun shot. When in New Mexico many years after I had tied a red handkerchief to a bush to attract the curiosity of the antelope, and it reminded me of the hunter that I had seen working the curiosity dodge on the deer. That night when I got into camp, Bill had not got in but came soon after, and he had hardly got the shack door open when he began roaring with laughter. I inquired what it was that pleased him so. ""Pleased me so?"" ""I guess I was pleased, and had you seen the dog-on nondescript that I did, you would have laughed your boots up."" I asked if he had seen the man dressed in red, white and black. Bill asked, ""Did you see it too?"" I told him of the hunter that I had met and talked with. Bill said that he had not been close enough to speak to it, and he was dog-on if he knew whether it was safe to get too close to the dog-on thing or not. We had good tracking snow from this time on during the remainder of the hunting season. We now each hunted by himself, working as usual over the ground that would bring us in the locality of our traps, which we would look after and relieve any fur bearers that we chanced to get. We met with one mishap during the season. Well along toward December I went to one of the bear traps that we had not been to in a number of days. The trap was a blacksmith made one with high jaws. I found the trap a short distance from where it had been set, tangled in an old tree top with a bear's foot in it. The bear had been caught just above the foot. As the trap jaws closed tight together the trap clog had got fast solid in the brush soon after the bear had been caught. The animal twisted and pulled until he had unjointed the foot, worn and twisted off the skin and cords of the leg and was gone. He had escaped some time during the night before I came to the trap. I reset the trap and then took the trail of the bear, which had taken a northeasterly course. I followed the trail until nearly night, when I became satisfied that he was making for a large windfall on a stream known as the South Fork, some fifteen miles away. I gave up the trail and returned to camp, which I reached about 10 o'clock at night. Bill was still keeping supper warm for me well knowing that something was out of the ordinary and wondering what it was. The next morning we held a council and concluded to look after a few traps near camp and put in a day of partial rest and prepare to take the bear's trail early the next morning. As planned the next morning, we had our blankets and a grub stake strapped to our backs and were off for the trail some time before daylight. Striking the bear's trail where I had left it about 9 o'clock in the forenoon, we followed the trail good and hard all day through wind jams and laurel patches, coming to the big windfall just before dark, very tired. We put up a rude shelter and camped for the night at the edge of the windfall. In the morning as soon as it was light enough to travel without danger of passing over the trail we were on the move. There were several hundred acres in the windfall so we concluded to go around and make sure that the bear was still there. Bill skirted the jam to the left while I went to the right. Not long after daylight it began to snow. We met on the east side of the jam about 11 o'clock without seeing anything of the crippled bear track, though I had crossed the trail of two bears that had gone into the jam two or three days before. We now concluded to go back to where the two bears had gone into the jam and one of us stand near the trail while the other one would drop below the trail and work around on the opposite side and drive them out if he could. The wind was blowing strong from the northeast, which would make it next to impossible for the bears to wind the watches. Bill said that he would watch as he could stand the cold weather better than I could. It was now snowing very hard, and we knew that the bears were aware of the approaching storm and had gone to the windfall to go into winter quarters. Chances were that they would not come out unless driven by getting close on to them. We were in hopes that the three bears might be all in one nest, and that the one that did the driving would stand a fair chance to get a shot at them as they left. I made my calculations from what I knew of the jam about where the bear would lay. Good luck was on my side this time and I hit it just right, coming on to them from the opposite side from where they had gone in, but I did not see or hear them when they went out. The first thing I knew of their whereabouts was when I came on to where the bears had been breaking laurel brush for their bunk. Will I did some fine looking and listening, but all to no purpose, as they had got the wind of me and had gone out. Undoubtedly they would not have done this had they been in their nest a few days longer and had got well to sleep. They had gone in under two large trees that had been blown out by the roots. They had taken dry rotten wood torn from the two old trees that formed the root to their winter quarters, and with laurel brush and other matter they had made very good quarters for the winter. I soon discovered that the lame bear was not with the two other bears. I did not follow the trail very far when I came onto the trail of the lame bear going on still further into the jam, but I did not follow it but continued on after the two bears to learn what luck Bill had had. I heard no gun shot and was afraid that the bear had not come within gun shot of Bill, although the bears were following nearly back on their trail that they went in on. When I came to the edge of the wind jam, I saw that the bear had of a sudden made some big jumps down the side of the hill. One of them had turned back into the jam while the other had followed down the hill, and Bill's track was following the trail. I did not go far when I saw Bill tugging away at the bear trying to draw it down to the hollow and near where we had camped the night before. It was still snowing very hard, and after getting the bear down to the hollow and near to what was called in those days a wagon road--a near trail cut out through the woods--we went to the camp where we had stayed over night and rebuilt the fire and ate a lunch. We had not eaten anything since morning, not wishing to spare the time. It was snowing so hard, and as we knew that we would not be able to reach camp until well along in the night, we concluded to again use the camp of the night before. We gathered a few more hemlock boughs and made the shelter a little more comfortable and went to roasting bear meat on a stick to help out the grub we had brought with us, so that we could look further for the lame bear the next morning. When morning came, it had snowed more than twelve inches, and as we were satisfied that the lame bear would not leave the jam, we concluded to go down the run about five miles to where a man lived by the name of Reese. Arrangements were made with him to get the bear down to his place where we could get it later. From Mr. Reese's we went to camp and waited a few days for the snow to settle a little. On the way back to camp we looked at two or three bear traps and found a small bear in one of the traps, and the last bear that we got during the season. We now began to take in the bear traps as we came near one on the way to camp. The snow was so deep we were obliged to reset the most of the small traps, although we had when setting out the traps taken every precaution to set in such places as would afford them all the shelter possible. After tending all the traps again, we went once more to see if we could route the lame bear. We spent two days searching the windfall in every quarter, but were unable to find a trace of the track. We were quite positive that she was still somewhere in the jam, but the snow had fallen so deep that it had completely obliterated all signs. Two years later I was one of a party that killed a bear and captured her two cubs. The old bear had one foot gone. I am quite sure that it was the one that had escaped from our traps. We now put in the time hunting deer and looking after the small traps until about the first of January, when we pulled all of our traps and went home. This ended my hunting with William Earl, one of the best pards that I ever hit the trail with, or followed a trap line. Bill left these parts and went back east to his native state, and after a time I lost all trace of him. CHAPTER XIV. Hunting and Trapping in Cameron County. It will be remembered that when Mr. Earl (or Bill, as I preferred to call him,) and the writer followed the bear from the Kinzua in McKene County, through Cameron County, that we saw signs of bear, deer, marten and other game quite plentiful in the region of Baley Run, Salt Run and Hunt's Run, and that we concluded to pitch our camp in that quarter. As there were no huckleberries in the vicinity of our homes, we decided to kill two birds with one stone, that was to pick some huckleberries and build our camp for the next season's hunt. Accordingly about the last days of July, we took a team and our outfit for camp building and started for Hunt's Run by way of the Sinnamahoning and Baley Run. At this time the country in that section was an unbroken forest of pine, oak and hemlock with a goon sprinkling of chestnut. As the saying was in those days, ""God owned the land in that section,"" so all we had to do was to go into the woods, select our camp site and proceed to build. (Boys, let me stop long enough to say it is different nowadays; you must go through a whole lot of red tape and get a permit to camp and the permit only lasts two weeks, when you must get a renewal.) The site we selected for our camp was on the left-hand branch of Hunt's Run. We rolled up the usual box log body, about 10 x 14 feet. We put up a bridge roof, putting up about four pairs of rafters and then using three or four small cross poles for roof boards. We then peeled hemlock bark, making the pieces about four feet long, which we used for shingles to cover the roof with. After the roof was completed, we felled a chestnut tree which we split into spaults about four feet long. With these we chinked all the cracks between the logs, striking the axe into the logs, close to the edge of the chinking and then driving a small wedge in the slot made by the axe to hold the chinking in place. Next we gathered moss from old fallen trees and stuffed all the cracks, using a blunt wedge to press the moss good and tight. We then begun on the mason work. We found a bank of clay that was rather free of stones and made a mortar by using water, making the mortar about as stiff as mortar usually used in house plastering. The chinking and mossing had been done from the inside, while we now filled the space between the logs good and full of mortar, or rather mud. The next work was to take the team and haul stones, which we found along the run and put up the fireplace. Considerable pains was taken and we done a pretty good job, as we hoped to use this camp for a number of seasons. After the fireplace was completed, we hung a door, using hinges made of blocks of wood and boring auger holes through one end. Shaping the other end on two of these eyes to drive in two holes boring into the logs close to the door jams. The other two eyes were flattened off and made long enough for door cleats as well as to form a part of the door hinge. Now a rod was run through these eyes or holes in these pieces. This formed a good, solid door hinge. Then a door latch was made from a slat of wood, which worked on a pin in a hole bored in one end of the slat and a hole bored through the door. A small hole in the slat and a string tied to latch and run through a hole in the door furnished the means of raising the latch. A loop for the latch to work in and a catch on the door jam and the door was complete. We next put in the window and made a bunk or bedstead from small poles and the hut was completed. I think we were about four days doing the work including an hour or so each day spent in picking huckleberries enough for our special need. Now as the camp was completed, we began to search for a place where we could find berries more plentiful than we had found them near camp. On the hillsides facing the river, where there were barrens, we found more. While searching for huckleberries we found a deerlick or salt log, which the deer were working good. Bill said he guessed we had better appropriate the loan of the lick for one night to our own use, and see if we could not get some venison to take home with us as well as huckleberries. When the sun was about an hour high, we took our guns and went to the salt log. There was no blind made to get in to watch them. We selected two jack pines that stood near together and we each climbed into a tree, breaking some of the boughs out that obstructed our view in the direction of the lick and laid the boughs across some limbs to sit on. We had scarcely got our seats fixed when I heard the crack of a limb off to our left. I whispered to Bill and pointed in the direction I had heard the breaking of the limb. Bill shook his head, to indicate that he had not heard anything, but had hardly done so when I saw Bill begin to cautiously shift his gun from the way it was pointed and slowly move it so as to shoot to his left. When he had the gun worked around so it pointed in the direction in which he wanted it, he began to raise it slowly to his shoulder. I thought to myself, that means venison for breakfast. I thought right, for when Bill touched the trigger and his gun spoke, I saw two yearling deer jump into sight and my gun came to my shoulder from habit, but there was no need to shoot. The second jump that the deer made one of them fell dead, the other one ran a few rods, stopped and looked back to see what had become of his mate. Bill's gun came to his shoulder like a flash, but I hollowed, ""Don't shoot."" Bill dropped his gun and said, I came dog-on-nigh making a fool of myself. We got down from our perches and dragged the deer (a yearling buck) out away from the lick, removed the entrails and Bill made a knapsack of the carcass and started for camp. The sun could still be seen shining on the highest peaks of the hills. Bill said, ""That fun was over with too quick; I had one of the most comfortable seats I ever had. I had no time to enjoy it, when you called my attention to those little bucks and spoiled all my comfort."" We got to camp before dark and stripped the skin from the deer, spread it out, cut all the meat from the bones, layed it on the skin, sprinkled some salt over it, then wrapped the meat up in the skin, saving out a few choice pieces to frizzle over the coals and eat with our lunch before bunking in for the night. We had seen some parties, while picking berries during the day. They told us that there was a man by the name of Sage living down on the river near Emporium, who had a large clearing on the hill only about a mile from where we were, or about two miles from our camp. He told us in which direction we would find the field, and said that we would find Mr. Sage there, as he was up there cutting oats. As the grub stake for the horses was getting rather low, and as we were not yet ready to go home, Bill said that if I would stay and jerk the venison (for here we cannot keep venison by hanging it up in a tree, or on a pole, as you can on the Pacific Coast or in the Rockies), he would go and see Mr. Sage. In the morning I began preparation to jerk the venison, while Bill went in search of grub for the horses. There was no road, but there was but very little down timber in the woods in those days, only occasionally a wind jam, which you had to work your way around. Bill found the clearing all right, and got oats in the bundle for the horses. Bill also made arrangements with Mr. Sage to bury eight bushels of potatoes and leave them on the hill where we could get them as we wished. Bill also killed a large rattlesnake on his way to the field, which he brought to camp, where we skinned and took out the oil. When we were skinning the snake Bill remarked, ""that he thought the fur rather light on the varmint, but it was a pretty cuss."" Let me say that at our place on the head waters of the Allegheny we had no eels, rattlesnakes or wartelberries, so we concluded that we would stop one night on the Sinnamahoning and get some eels to take home with us. While Bill was gone for horse feed I was busy jerking the venison. I gathered a good hill of dry hemlock bark from the logs, burned it to a good pile of live coals. I now made a rack or gridiron by driving four crotched stakes in the ground about the embers and then laid small poles across in the crotches to form a rack to spread the venison on over the coals. I stood hemlock bark up about the rack, freshly peeled from the tree and covering the top over also with bark, which forms an oven. It is necessary to remove the top or cover occasionally and turn the meat, and say, boys, next June when you are out camping just kill a small deer and prepare the meat as described. Is it good? I guess yes. Having our work completed at the camp, the next morning after we had got the horses fed and the venison prepared, we drove back onto Baleys Run. Here we camped near the mouth of the run, and that night we set fifty eel hooks, some in the run and some in the main Sinnamahoning. I think that we caught twenty-two eels and some trout. As we were now in a section where there were some barrens, which contained good huckleberry picking, we put in the next day picking berries until near night, and drove home at night, a distance of about twenty miles. All the time while picking berries, setting eel hooks and trout fishing, of which we did enough to supply our needs, we kept a close watch for signs of animals that we intended to take in later on. We saw signs of mink, coon and where an otter had been at play on a steep bank of the run. We saw signs of bear in several places where they had torn old logs to pieces in search of grub and ants. We saw at one place where a bear had dug out a woodchuck, and I should judge by the amount of digging he had done that he earned his chuck. We saw considerable signs of bear in the huckleberries, and of them will have more to say later on. * * * About October first, Bill and your humble servant again started for camp, which we found all right. From all appearances it had been occupied for several days by someone, probably berry pickers, and as usual they had burned up what wood we had cut. Bill made a little kick, and said they were welcome to the camp, but he would be ""dog-on"" pleased if they would cut what wood they burned. Our first week in camp was spent in cutting a good supply of wood and mudding the shack a little in places where we failed to do good work the first time. Being located well up at the head of the streams, it made it necessary for us to do a good deal of traveling to get from one stream to another where the water was of sufficient size to afford good trapping ground. Steel traps being none too plenty with us now, we started in to build deadfalls. The territory so far as trapping was concerned was left to Bill and I, and we took in the waters of Baley Run, the Portage, Conley Run and Hunt's Run, as well as several lesser streams. As the Baley was the farthest from our camp, Bill said we would put up the traps on that stream first. Bill said that we would go at it man fashion, for we would be compelled to get our grub from the trap line, for there was no chance to take a wood job in that section of the country. I suggested that we might get a job at the lumber camp, where we sold the deer the year before, and get a few beans and a little pork. I guess that Bill did not like the idea, for I remember he only gave me a grunt for an answer. Say, boys, the question of pork and beans leads me to ask how many of you who have a fireplace in your camp have a bean hole? Now, Bill and I had one in our camp, and I tell you we thought it fine and we did it in this way. We dug a hole in one corner of the fireplace about two and a half feet deep and about eighteen inches in diameter, using the regular old style of bake kettle. This is merely an iron pot, with a close fitting flange lid so as to seclude all dust and ashes, and we used it in this way. We would first rake a good lot of live coals from the fireplace into the bean hole, having the beans already in the kettle. Then we would put the kettle down in the hole and rake the hole full of live embers, being careful to cover the hole over with plenty of ashes. We prepared the beans about in this fashion: After washing we soaked them for about twelve hours. The water was drained off and the beans were then put into the kettle with the necessary trimmings, which consisted of a good chunk of pork put in the center of the beans, and two or three smaller pieces laid on top, a pinch of salt providing that the pork was not sufficiently salty. A spoonful of brown sugar or rather a little baking molasses and a little pepper. Now this kettle was allowed to remain three or four days in the hole without disturbing farther than to cover over occasionally with hot embers. You ask if beans are good baked this way--we guess yes. We have heard a great deal about the famous Boston baked beans, but we wish to say that they are not in it compared to beans baked in a bean hole. Well, to get back to the trap line. We took the Baley waters first. This was about six miles from camp, and as it was still a little earlier in the season than we cared to begin to take fur, we would build the deadfalls and have them ready to set when we thought that fur was ripe enough to begin to gather. Bill used a good heavy axe, and would cut the dead pole and bed pieces and the stakes and fit them all ready to put up. He would then go on and select a place to build another trap and get the material all ready as before and then move on to the next place. I would follow him up and build the trap, make the bait pen and have the trap all ready to set when the right time came. The triggers we would make evenings in camp. We always used the three-stick trigger, for then we could adjust the trigger so that we were sure that the front legs of the animal were over the bed piece, when the trap was sprung. In that condition there was not get-away for the animal that tried to snip the bait. We would build traps on one stream until we had a plenty for that stream. We would take up another and put in a supply on that stream, and so on until we had gone over as much ground as we could work to good advantage. All the time we were putting up these deadfalls we were keeping a watch out for likely places to set our steel traps for fox and other animals. After we had gone over the streams we built the necessary deadfalls in the dark, heavy timbered sections where we thought likely that there might be marten. As it was now well along toward the last of October, we set our bear traps on the different ridges in the sections where the chestnut timber was the most plenty. The chestnut crop was good and we knew that the first hard freeze would open the burs. Bill said we got to get a move on us from early in the morning until after dark when we would get into camp. We wished to get all the traps out now that we could. Later we were going to put in some time gathering chestnuts, as soon as they began to fall, as there was good money in gathering them. At this business there was lively competition with the squirrels, coons, bears and other animals to see which could gather the most, so naturally there is but a few days good picking after the chestnuts fall. Bill said that we would be in a deal while the nuts lasted and we did, for we gathered several bushels. I do not just remember how many now, but that wasn't all we got while we were gathering chestnuts. One day we came to where a bear had been raking for nuts and as it was only about a mile from camp I said to Bill that it might be possible that if we would stay out and watch for Bruin as long as we could see to shoot, we might get a shot at the bear. Bill said that he preferred to let the traps do the watching. There was a little mist of rain falling, and just the right kind of weather for Bruin to be prowling around. Some way it seemed to me if we stayed and watched we would get a shot at a bear, but Bill had no faith and said that I would get good and wet for my trouble. I told him that if he would take what nuts I had gathered along to the shanty, I would stay and watch awhile at least. Bill agreed, and said that he would have a hot supper ready for me when I came to camp. I suggested to Bill that he have the frying pan hot when I got there, for I would bring in some bear meat for supper. Bill said that I need not bother to skin his, as he would eat his hair and all. As soon as Bill was gone I selected a point where I could see down the hill, as well as over a good stretch of the top of the ridge. I had only fairly picked my ground to watch when I heard the brush crack close to me from behind. My gun came to my shoulder as I turned in the direction of the noise, and there stood Bill a-grinning. I asked him what had changed his mind. He said that if I could stand it he could, so he stepped along the ridge a few yards and I leaned up against a large hemlock tree. He had scarcely taken his stand when all of a sudden I saw him begin to slowly raise his gun to his shoulder. I knew that he was about to shoot at something, but thought it must be a deer. I thought that I ought to shout and scare it away, for I thought that Bill had come back on purpose to beat me out of the sport, and I guessed right. Bill said after he had started to camp it seemed to him that he had done wrong in leaving me to watch alone, and that I would kill a bear. So he turned back and got there just in time so as not to frighten the bear away, as well as to shoot it, which was a yearling and weighed about 125 pounds, with a fine pelt. Bill apologized for the little trick. Said he would never do anything of the kind again. He never did. A good reason being that another opportunity never occurred. But later I will tell how I got the laugh on Bill. The next morning Bill took the saddles of the bear to Emporium and sold the meat, but he said that bear meat was not at a premium in Emporium. I think he got about $6.00 out of the saddles. While Bill was gone to Emporium I took two bear traps and went on to a ridge where I thought would be the most likely place to catch a bear, as there was considerable beach timber on that ridge in places. Beach nuts last long after chestnuts are gone, and bear would be likely to work in this timber. As we had not got all of our small traps out yet, Bill said that if I would finish setting the rest of the small traps, he would put in the most of his time hunting deer, as the leaves were now pretty well off from the undergrowth, so that the woods were now quite open. This I agreed to, as I knew Bill to be a good deer hunter, while I was a little skeptical as to some of his trapping methods. Well, as the busy season was with us now, it was an early breakfast and a late supper day after day. Yet we were able to keep up the pace from the natural stimulating desire for sport, being anxious to know what the results of the next day would be. We were having the usual success of the average hunter and trapper who, as Bill said, if willing to get a move on, our supply of meat and game was never lacking, for I always shot at small game when hunting deer. Bill said that he did not like to come into camp empty handed, so he would shoot a grouse or a squirrel whenever a chance occurred. We had no snow up to this time, so that deer hunting was a little dull, and Bill said that he would take a line of traps, either on Baley Run or on the Conley, as I liked. I said, take your choice, Bill, so he said he would go to Conley Run, which was a little farther from camp than the Baley Run, and one or two more bear traps than on Baley Run. I found a coon or two, and I think I got a fox and one marten, but no mink or other furs. I found that a bear had been to one trap and torn down the bait pen and taken the bait, but left the trap unsprung. I knew that he would cut the same trick again, if I set the trap there, so I bent over a small sapling and hung the carcass of a coon on it for a bait. The carcass hung four or five feet from the ground. [Illustration: RESULTS OF A FEW WEEKS' TRAPPING.] I set the trap under the carcass and said to myself, ""Old fellow, when you take that coon, there will be a bear dance."" I got to camp long after dark, but when I came in sight of camp and looked for a light, there was no light to be seen, or any Bill to be found in camp. I lit a light and looked at my watch. It was only a few minutes of eight o'clock. I got supper and waited until nine o'clock, but no Bill came, so I laid down on the bunk to rest, expecting Bill to turn up every minute. I dropped to sleep and when I awoke, the fire had burned out and Bill had not returned. I looked at my watch. It was after three o'clock, and I knew that there would be no more sleep for me. I went outside and listened, but no sound could be heard. I got my breakfast, put an extra lunch in my knapsack, and sat down and waited for the break of day. As soon as the first streaks of light appeared in the east, I strapped on my knapsack, took my gun and started in the direction in which I had known Bill to take. I followed the ridge to the Conley Run waters, over which Bill would likely come if he had been detained in that region. When I came to the head of a run that led to the main Conley waters, I stopped at the brow of the hill. I could look down into the hollow. Here I knew that I could be heard for some distance. I listened for some time to see if I could hear a gun shot or any other noise that would lead me to the whereabouts of Bill. Not a sound to be heard, not even the hoot of an owl. I gave a long whoop and then listened, but still no answering sound. I again gave a long continued ""co-hoop"" and Bill burst out laughing, and asked what was the matter with me. Bill had sat down on a fallen tree that lay close to a large pine tree to rest before making the last pull to the top of the ridge. He had caught a glimpse of me just before I came to the brow of the hill where I stopped to send a wireless message. Bill skulked behind a pine tree to see what I would do and give me a scare, when I came along. When I inquired what had kept him out all night, he said that he got so big a job on his hands that he could not get to camp. Bill said that he had got about half way down the side of the hill from the ridge leading down into the Conley River, when he jumped a buck, which Bill said slid down the hill like a greased rag. He fired at the pile and happened to catch him well back to the hips. The deer being wounded through the small intestines made it very sick, but it was still able to lead Bill a merry chase. Bill had been working from the middle of the forenoon until about three o'clock in the afternoon before he was able to get in a finishing shot on the buck. While following the deer, he had come near one of the places where we had a bear trap set and found that a bear had been caught. He followed the trail a little ways, and as it led in an opposite direction from that taken by the deer, Bill said he thought he would finish one job at a time, so he continued after the deer. Before Bill was able to get in the finishing shot on the deer, it had swung around in the direction of the trail of the bear, so that when Bill finally got the buck, he knew that he could not be far from the trail of the bear. He hung up the saddles of the deer, which he had started to take to camp, and let the bear rest until the next morning. After hanging up the saddles he didn't search long until he found the trail of the bear, and followed the trail only a little ways, when he found Bruin fast in a clump of brush. Bill then killed the bear, and taking out the entrails, rolled the carcass up over a log and again started for camp with the deer saddles. He did not go far when it was so dark that it was difficult to travel and carry the deer saddles and gun, so Bill said he thought he would build a little shelter and camp for the night. Bill had started for camp with the saddles of the buck as soon as he could see to travel. He was near the top of the ridge on his way to camp and had sat down to rest when I came to the brow of the hill and began to ""co-hoop"" to see if I could get any word from him, which I did and much closer than expected. Bill brought his load up to where I was, and threw it down with the remark ""I suppose that you did not think to bring along an extra lunch, did you?"" When I told him I had the extra lunch, and also a bottle of tea (Bill being a great hand for tea). Well, said Bill, ""then we are all right, once more."" We now hung the deer saddles up, and went back after the bear. After setting the bear trap again, as Bill did not have time after he had killed the bear, we started to carry the bear to camp whole. We soon found it too heavy to carry that way, so skinned it and hung up the foreparts and took the skin and hindquarters. The next morning, we went back after the deer. We went to where Bill had left the fore parts of the deer; then we went to where the fore parts of the bear were left, intending to take them as far as where the deer saddles were and leave them there, and take the deer saddles to camp. When we got to where the bear meat had been left, we found that a cat had been there, and filled his shirt on bear meat. It was not far to where we had a steel trap setting. I told Bill to go on slowly with the deer meat, and I would go and get the trap and set it for the cat. Bill said that he thought that would be the right thing to do, as there was a two dollar bounty on wild cats. He said we could carry the pelt of the cat a great deal easier than we could tote the bear meat; he thought that the cat skin and the bounty would even things up for the bear meat. I soon had the trap set for the cat, and then hurried on to catch Bill. We went to camp with the deer and the next morning we took the bear and deer saddles to Emporium and shipped them to New York. The distance that we toted those saddles must have been ten or twelve miles. Say boys, won't a man do more hard work to get thirty cents out of a coon skin, or a saddle of venison, or bear, than he would to get thirty dollars in some other way? As it had been three or four days since we had been over a good part of the trap line, we now got back to regular business, each one taking up his line of traps. Each night when he came to camp, we would have some kind of pelts to stretch, either two or three coon, a mink or two, as many more fox, with now and then a marten. It would take the evening to stretch the pelts and tell our day's experience just what particular trap we got that or this fox in, or that mink or coon; just how clever some shy old fox has worked to get the bait at a certain trap; on what particular ridge or point we had seen Old Golden's track (you know all large buck deer have the name of ""Old Golden"".) Every man of the woods or trap line knows what pleasure there is in relating the experience of the day's hunt or of the trap line to his pard during the evening in camp. Yet, I will tell of one occurrence though I have told the story many times, and I cannot say that I relate it with any great amount of pleasure. Still since many years have passed, I have often laughed over the circumstance. I can still see that sympathetic grin of Bill's, when he would ask ""if it hurt me much."" It was a lowery morning, and Bill proposed that we go together and look after a line of traps on Salt Run, and then put in the balance of the day still-hunting deer. We went down to the lower end of the line, worked up the run so as to be near the top of the ridge and in a locality where we expected deer to be. We had not looked at more than three or four traps, when we came to one that was set under the bank. The trap chain was stapled to a root, and was stationary (and let me say here that I believe it bad policy to fasten a trap to anything, stationary) and it certainly was in this case for me. The water was quite deep right at the point where the trap was set and came close up to the bank. In order to see the trap, it was necessary to lie down on my stomach, and lean my head over the bank. When I looked down under the bank, I saw that there was some animal in the trap. The trap chain was drawn tight and when I drew gently on the chain I could tell that some kind of an animal was in the trap. I little suspected that it was loaded, as it proved to be. I could not see what sort of an animal it was, but supposed it was a mink. It did not like to be drawn out in sight, and I was afraid to pull too hard on the chain for fear I would draw his foot out of the trap. I let up and straightened up to consult Bill, as to the best thing to do. Bill said, pull him out and if he gets away, we will get him at another trap, and I now suspect that Bill knew what was coming. I leaned down over the bank and stuck my head down to see where the chain was. All of a sudden I was struck with something more terrible than lightning if not quite so fatal, and for the next half hour I was rolling on the ground and washing my eyes. Bill said that I danced the Bear dance and a Pot Full of Catfish all at the same time. When I recovered enough to see what ""hit me"", I found that I had been terribly shot by a measly skunk square in both eyes. Bill was grinning and asking ""if it hurt much"" and telling me that I could see better after a little and lots of other sympathetic nothings. I hope that none of you may ever have the experience that I met with by the treatment of that infernal skunk. After the atmosphere and my eyes had cleared somewhat, we went on and looked after the balance of the traps on the run. We then started out to hunt deer, Bill taking one side of the ridge and I the other. I saw nothing more of Bill until I reached camp long after dark. I worked along the different spires of the main ridge and through the heads of the different basins, and only got a glimpse of an old buck's tail, making over the ridge and beckoning me to come on. He had come over from the opposite side of the ridge and had got wind of me before he was fairly in sight. I kept on working the different points and basins, shaping my course as best I could in the direction of the camp. A drizzling rain kept up all day, and deer had not moved very much. I felt confident that towards evening the deer would come out in the open to feed in spite of the rain, and pretty well toward night I had the satisfaction of seeing three deer feeding along the hillside and coming in my direction. The wind was in my favor, and as the deer were rather too far to shoot, I stood quiet, only occasionally moving from one tree to another as a favorable opportunity occurred. The deer finally worked up in gun shot, and they proved to be an old doe, a yearling and the doe's fawn. The yearling was undoubtedly the doe's fawn of the year before. I was very careful to make a sure shot on the doe. The yearling and the fawn only took a few jumps when the gun cracked and the doe went down, and stood looking at the old lady to see what had happened to her. I gave the yearling the contents of the other barrel. He made a jump or two and went down, the fawn still standing and wondering what was taking place, but before I could get a load into my gun, the little fellow thought it best to move on. I took the entrails out of the two I had shot, hung them up and took a lively pace to camp. Bill was already in and had supper waiting. Bill asked me if I had seen any deer, and when I told him what I had done, he said that he had seen a deer. I told him that if he had used a little skunk eye-opener, he probably would have seen some deer. As it had now been three or four days since we had made the rounds of the bear traps, we concluded that we would not spend any particular time in deer hunting until we had looked all of the bear traps over. We were quite sure that some of the traps would be likely to be in a mixup with bruin as the weather had been favorable for bruin to be prowling around. Further we had seen several fresh tracks in the past few days. Early in the morning with an extra lunch in our knapsack we started out to see what luck with bruin, each taking a different route. Bill went to Baley Run, while I went to Conley Run. I had not gone far out on my road, when I came across a man that had been out as he said, hunting deer. But from the story he told, I judged that he had put in the greater part of his time hunting himself, and he was still lost. The man informed me that he was from Lockhaven, Pa., and that his name was Henry Jacobs; and that he was boarding at a farmhouse on the Portage but had gotten a little mixed and was unable to find his way out to his boarding place. I told him that I was on my way to the Conley waters to look after some bear traps, and if he wished he could go with me to the main branch of the Conley. Then he could follow the stream down until it emptied into the Portage, and to the road which would take him to his boarding house, which Mr. Jacobs seemed pleased to do. But it proved that Mr. Jacobs' destiny was in other directions. The first bear trap that we came to, we found a ""porky"" in it. I could see that Mr. Jacobs was very much excited and began to ask many questions as to bears and bear trapping. When we came to where the second trap was setting, we found things generally torn up and the trap gone, and it was plain to be seen that it was no cub that had taken the trap this time. The bear had gone only a few yards, when he had gotten fast in some saplings, and he had gnawed the brush and raked the trees and ""raised Ned"" generally; but had finally released the clog and had gone on down the hillside. By this time I had discovered that Mr. Jacobs had become pretty nervous and was shaking rather too much to do good shooting. At every rod we advanced along the trail, it was plain to be seen that Mr. Jacobs was becoming more and more excited. We did not follow the trail far when we discovered Bruin fast again. We went up within a few yards of the bear, who did not seem to like our company and would chank his jaws and snort similar to an angry hog. I told Mr. Jacobs to shoot the bear, and he did shoot somewhere, but I could not say that he shot in the direction of the bear. As my attention had been on the bear, I had not noticed Mr. Jacobs in particular, but when I saw that he had entirely missed the bear, I looked at him and he was shaking so from excitement, that he could not have hit a barn, and drops of sweat stood all over his forehead. He had a double barrel rifle, and as soon as he fired the first shot, he advanced a few steps toward the bear and fired again, and at once began to reload his gun, all the time going nearer to the bear until I was afraid that he would get so close that the bear could reach him. I had to caution him and tell him to step back, that he was getting too close. When Mr. Jacobs had one barrel of his gun loaded, he immediately fired again, with the same results of the other two shots. I told him to take my gun and try it, which he did with no better results. Mr. Jacobs was all the time becoming more and more excited, and the sweat was running off him like a man in the harvest field. I loaded my gun, while Mr. Jacobs was loading his, and after Mr. Jacobs fired another shot with no better results, I though that the fun had gone far enough, and shot the bear. After the bear was dead, Mr. Jacobs wondered why it was so hard to hit a bear's head. ""Just look at it,"" he said, ""it is as large as a dry goods box"". As soon as the bear was dead, Mr. Jacobs wanted to know if I would sell the bear. When I told him that I expected to sell it, he asked what it was worth. I told him that I thought the hide and meat would bring thirty or thirty-five dollars. He drew out his purse and said, ""I will take it."" I told him that if he wanted the bear, that we would call it twenty-five dollars, as he should have something for his part in the game. He declared that the hunt had been worth a hundred dollars to him. We made a sort of a litter or drag rack with which we managed to haul the bear down the hill to an old lumber road where it could be reached with a team. Not long after this I received a copy of the Williamsport Sun containing the report of a monstrous bear captured by Mr. Jacobs in the wilds of Cameron County. It was a bear story equal to the one the prophet relates when the children called him Baldy. When I got to camp I found Bill stretching a couple of mink skins. He had also got a fox or two, and said that a bear had been in one of the bear traps, but had escaped, leaving two toes in the trap. Bill was considerably down at the heel over the escape of the bear, and said that if he had attended to the trap the day before, that the bear was then in the trap; that he had put up a hard fight before he had made his escape. When Bill called for my report I took out a marten skin and the money that I got for the bear and layed them on the table and told Bill there was my count. Bill said that I got the marten from one of the deadfalls, but he was dog-on sorry if he could tell where I caught the money. When I told him about Mr. Jacobs and the capture of the bear, Bill said he would have given a summer's work to have been there and seen the man sweat. I said that I would relate how it happened that I got even with Bill for the bear that he killed on my watching grounds. Well, after we had gone the rounds of the traps, we again put in our time still-hunting. Bill had gone south of camp, while I went east. I had traveled until the middle of the afternoon without having any luck or seeing any deer. So I shifted my course to the west and worked my way in the direction of a ""burn-down"" that was in the head of a hollow. As soon as I came to the brow of the ridge and looked down into the basin I saw four deer feeding and working towards me. The wind was blowing directly from the deer towards me, so I stood quiet and in a few minutes the deer fed up within easy range. I pulled the gun onto an old doe in the lead, and broke her down almost in her tracks. The three remaining deer made a few jumps in my direction and stopped and looked back, which gave me a good shot at a yearling buck, which also went down in my sight. The other two deer ran close by me and over the ridge into the green timber. I had hardly cut the deers' throats when Bill called out, ""This is a dog-on pretty trick that you have played me."" Bill had been following these deer all day and had followed to the ""burn-down"" and had seen the deer on the opposite hill, but too far away to shoot. As the wind was against him he had dropped down the hollow a ways, crossed and worked up around on the opposite side to get the wind in his favor, and was just about ready to fire on the deer when I began shooting. After Bill had explained how he had been working the deer all day and then have me slip in just as he had the game bagged and swipe it, Bill claimed was dog-on mean. I cautioned Bill to hold his temper and I would call it even on the bear he swiped from me, and told him I was pleased to have him on hand to help hang up the deer. We had worked along now up to about the middle of December with the various ups and downs that one on the trap line and trail always meet with. We had killed twelve or fourteen deer, and I think we had caught six bears and had made a fair catch of fox, mink, marten and some other furs. There had not been much snow up to this time, when a fall of 12 or 14 inches came all in one night. Bears had not denned up to this time, but we were quite sure that bruin would now go into winter quarters. We concluded to gather up the bear traps and all the small traps that were not setting in springs that did not freeze, or those setting in other likely places to make a catch. In nearly the last bear trap that we went to get, we found a bear, and when we began to skin it we found that it had lost two toes on one forefoot. We concluded that it was the same bear that had escaped from Bill's trap some time before, although it was eight or ten miles from where the trap was that had held Bruin's toes. A day or two after the heavy fall of snow we got a letter from a man by the name of Comstock, living at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, asking the privilege to come and camp with us and hunt deer until the season closed, the first of January. He stated that he had never killed a deer, and that he was very anxious to kill one. We wrote him to come on, and that one of us would be at Emporium on the following Friday to guide him to our camp. Friday morning I went to Emporium and found Mr. Comstock there as agreed. He had paraphernalia enough to equip a fair-sized army, so we hired a team to take the outfit to camp and also bring out the saddles of a bear and what venison we had on hand. For three or four days Mr. Comstock hunted all by himself but had no luck in the way of killing deer, as he said it took more time to hunt the shanty than he had to hunt deer, and suggested that we all hunt in company. We had now been on the ground long enough so that we had learned all the runways. Bill said that if I would take Mr. Comstock down to a certain runway, which he had given the name of Fork Point, and place him on it, he would drive the ridge and see if he could not drive a deer to Mr. Comstock. Bill started a bunch of five deer and succeeded in getting a shot and breaking a foreleg of a large doe. As the doe with the broken leg soon dropped out from the other deer, he was sure that the deer had start enough so that they would come through to where Comstock and I were watching, he decided to take the trail of the broken legged doe, and as good luck, the deer did come through to Mr. Comstock, and as he had an Osgood gun with four shots, he succeeded in killing a very large buck. After firing the four shots, the fun began. Mr. Comstock was determined to take the buck to camp, as he wanted to take the deer home whole. We had a very steep point to climb for a distance of five hundred yards to reach the top of the ridge. The deer weighed about two hundred pounds. Any hunter will tell you what an awkward job it is to carry a deer of that weight lashed to a pole. Mr. Comstock would not consent to drawing the deer for fear it would rake the hair off. Well, we could not carry it up the steep point on the pole, as the swaying of the deer would throw us off our feet. Mr. Comstock said that he would carry it alone if I would help him get it on his shoulder. Mr. Comstock was a large man, weighing over two hundred pounds, but nevertheless I did not think he would be able to carry the deer and told him so. After some hard tugging we got the deer on his shoulder and he started up the hill. I started to get out of the way, and I was none too soon in doing so. Mr. Comstock had not taken a half dozen steps when back he came, deer and all, like ten thousand bricks. But as he did not break any limbs or his neck, he was bound to try it again, which he did with the same result. But this time he was quite badly bruised, and he was now satisfied to leave the deer until morning, when Bill went with us and we made a sort of a litter and carried it to camp whole; and he was a proud and happy man. When Mr. Comstock and I left the deer and decided to await reinforcements, we struck the trail of Bill, drawing a deer in the direction of camp, so we now knew why Bill had not followed the trail of the deer through to where Comstock and I were watching. It was now about the closing time for deer hunting, so after Mr. Comstock had left for home, Bill and I put in the time until the first of March tending the small traps with the usual success of the average trapper, getting a fox, or mink or marten or some piece of fur nearly every day. When the team which we had written home for came and got our camp outfit and our furs, we broke camp and went home to await another trapping season. CHAPTER XV. Trapping and Bee Hunting. Comrades of the trap line and trail, as every trapper and hunter likes to know what other trappers and hunters are doing, I will tell of some of my last season's (1908) doings. Having been somewhat relieved from my old enemy--rheumatism--I concluded to take a trip south and see if I could not find a place suitable to my liking where I might escape some of the rigorous cold of the Northern Pennsylvania winters. I went first into Southeastern Missouri. Here I found land cheap, unimproved lands ranging from $3.00 to $15.00 per acre; also plenty of timber for fuel and building purposes; plenty of fish of various kinds, some deer, a few wild turkeys, no bear, some mink, plenty of raccoon, a few otter and fox; with minor other fur-bearers, which was all quite satisfactory to me, but I did not like the water. From Poplar Bluff, Missouri, I went to Kenset, Arkansas, where I found the conditions as to the price of lands satisfactory, although the country was much less broken than Southern Missouri. As to water, well, there was water almost anywhere; in fact, you could hardly cross the streets without wading in water. The people who were natives of that country informed me that the water in the streets was not always so plenty, as they said that there had been very heavy rains of late. Here I found game of all kinds quite scarce, although I was told that southeast of Kenset game was quite plenty, including bear, deer, turkeys, quail, etc., and that mink, otter, coon, opossum, also a few wolves, were to be found. The water gave me the chills in three days, so I concluded to move to other parts of the lower St. Francis River, in Lee County. There appeared to be quite a plenty of mink, otter, coon and some bear, but the cane brakes were pretty thick in the bottoms. I think that if one was well prepared for trapping, they could do fairly well in either St. Francis or Lee County. I went from Hanes in Lee County, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee. From Memphis I went to a town by the name of Shepard, on the Hatchie River, in Haywood County, Tennessee. Along the Hatchie River there were signs of otter, mink and coon quite plenty, and in some places the cane brakes were quite open. I liked the lay of the land here very well. It was just rolling enough to suit my fancy, but again I failed to find our cold, Pennsylvania spring water. From Shepard I went to Pickens, in Pickens County, South Carolina. Here I found fairly good water, but other conditions were not entirely to my liking. While I did not have time to look up the game or rather the fur-bearers as thoroughly as I would have liked to, yet I saw considerable signs of mink and coon and was told that there were quite a number of otter in that section on some of the streams. From Pickens I bought a ticket to Columbus, Ohio, where I intended to stop over a day and call on the editor of the greatest of sporting magazines, _Hunter-Trader-Trapper,_ but when I got to Columbus my courage failed. I was afraid that the editor would be too busy pushing the quill to bother with a lone trapper, so concluded to hasten back to old Potter, where chills, jiggers, ticks, fleas and poisonous snakes are unknown, and where the cold, sparkling spring water flows from the mountain side to your very door. Say, boys, you may think that I am stuck on the water question. Well, I am, and I have good cause to me. Only for spring water, I should not have been able to have made the journey which I am writing of. For the past two years, barring the time I was south, I have drank from four to six quarts of cold spring water every twenty-four hours. I have got more relief from rheumatism than I ever did from all the rheumatism remedies that I ever knew of, and I have tried the most of them. I used all the salt in my food that I could to aid the desire for water, and took six drops of oil of wintergreen three times a day. Now, if any of the old trappers have rheumatism and the good spring water, I ask you to try it. Well, after getting back home and resting a few days and the frost began to hit the pumpkin vine, I began to feel as I imagined that the wild goose does about their migratory time. At least I felt as though I should fly if I did not get into the woods. We were having splendid weather for camping, and the warm, dry, sunny days afforded splendid weather for bee hunting, and after the trap and gun then my delight is to trail the honey bee to his den tree. One day when a young man called on me and said that he would give me an interest in a ""goose pasture"" to go out in the woods and camp, I was interested. Smoky Jim (that is his nickname) although his name is Charles Earl, and there is nothing smoky about Charley except his pipe, which he is very fond of, too much so, I think, for so young a man. Well, when Charley said that he would like to go and camp out in the woods, I was practically as good as gone. I knew Smoky to be a lively kid and all right, although he had never put in any time as a trapper or a bee hunter. I said, ""Smoky, can you see a bee fly?"" Smoky said that he thought he could, for he knew that he could tell when one stung him, but he had never watched to see how far he could see one fly. I found that Smoky was given to making comical remarks as well as to smoking. I said, ""Smoky, what day can you go?"" He replied, ""Any day."" This was on Tuesday, so I said, ""Alright, Smoky, be here Thursday and we will start early Friday morning."" Smoky said, ""Alright, but we will not get a darn thing while we are gone if we go on Friday unless we get drowned, and there will have to be more water in the creek than there is now or we won't get that much."" I had already made application to the State Tourist Commissioner for a permit to camp on state lands. It may be well to state here for the benefit of those who wish to so camp in this state (Pennsylvania) that the authorities will not give a permit to camp for a longer time than 14 days. In my case they were very obliging and made out the papers for several applicants of 14 days each, so that it would only have been necessary to have signed one of the applications and send it on a few days before the previous application had expired. [Illustration: WOODCOCK FISHING ON THE SINNAMAHONING.] We were all ready to start Friday morning. Our route lay over the mountains a distance of about 20 miles from the head waters of the Allegheny to the head water of the west branch of the Susquehana waters, known as the East Fork of the Sinnamahoning. We pitched our tent just at the point where the Buffalo and Susquehana Railroad begins to cross the divide, known as the Hogback, by means of several switch backs. It is a splendid sight to see two or three trains working their way up the mountain's side on a clear, frosty morning, when the steam and smoke show so plain. We did not get the tent in good shape for the first night, nor did we get our bunk up, owing to its being so late when we got to our camping ground. The first night in camp we had a sharp frost and in the morning Smoky Jim's fever for camping had dropped fully one-half. He complained that any one that would go into such a country to camp should be reported for trespassing on the rights of the porcupine. It took until the third day to get our camp in good shape. We built a skeleton frame of small poles all over the tent, leaving a space of about 18 inches between tent and frame, and thatched it good with hemlock boughs. While we were working at the camp we had our bee bait out, and the second day after we put out the bait no bees came to it. Smoky laughed at me and said that a honey bee was too intelligent to stop in a place like that, but Smoky was wrong. The next morning after the sun had got well above the top of the hills, so as to warm up things down in the valley, I heated a large stone quite hot and burned some honey comb on it. It was not long before Smoky called out to me and said that there was one fool of a bee. It was not long before we had bees a-plenty. We paid no attention to them farther than to keep plenty of bait out for them. Every bee hunter knows how much steadier a bee flies after they have the bait well located. After the camp was well completed and a good pile of wood cut we gave our attention to the bees. We soon located two lines, one going nearly east while the other went nearly south. I told Smoky to take his hatchet and go across the creek some 50 rods and make an opening or a stand about half way between the two lines, or about southeast from the stand, and when he had it ready, to call to me and I would bring the bees over and we could get a cross line and locate nearly the tree that the bees were in. We soon got the direction in which the bees flew. I then told Smoky to take the line that now flew in a westerly course from the stand and in the direction of two or three large maple trees. The other line now flew nearly north from the stand and back toward the creek where there was considerable large timber still standing. Leaving the bait on the stand, I took the course of the bees that were now flying north and went to a large birch tree that was standing on the bank of the creek. I was still several rods from the tree when the bees began coming to me and I knew that the tree was close by. I was looking the different trees over to see which tree the bees were in when Smoky began to halloo as though something terrible had happened him. Guessing at the cause of Smoky's shouting, I continued on in the direction in which the line led and soon saw the bees going into the large birch tree. I took my knife and cut the letters B T on the tree and then went to Smoky, who was still making the woods ring with his shouts. Smoky began guying me, saying that I was an old bee hunter but it took Smoky to find the first bee tree. I did not tell him that I had found the tree that the other line of bees went to, but agreed with him. I told him to mark the tree that he had located and then he could go and locate the other tree if he wished while I would go to camp and be getting grub ready. In about three-quarters of an hour Smoky came to camp and began washing for dinner and said not a word. When I saw that Smoky would not talk, I said, ""Well, Smoky, did you find the other bee tree?"" He said, ""Oh! you keep right on baking flapjacks."" Well, after Smoky regained his speech and told how blamed bright I was, he was going to go right to work and take out the honey from one of the trees at once. I told him that as we had no screen to put over his face, the bees would sting him to death, and that he had better wait until early the next morning when it was frosty. Smoky said that he would not go without honey for the flapjacks when we had two bee trees so close to the camp. So he took an old burlap and removed every other thread in a space of about ten inches square, making a sort of an open-work to cover his face, then pulling the sack over his head and buttoning his coat close up about his throat Smoky was ready for the fray. He cut the birch tree, the one that I had located, that tree being a little closer to camp. There was over a hundred pounds of honey in the tree and we had only one large pail in the camp, and that we had to have to use as a water pail. The tree did not break in falling so as to break up the honey and waste it. While we cut a large beech tree and took a block of about four feet long and split it in half and dug out two large troughs to hold the honey, which was very nice, being nearly all white honey, and Smoky said, ""Old Golden, won't we live high now, rabbit, partridge, baked potatoes, buckwheat flapjacks and honey to swim in."" It was now the 20th of October. I told Smoky that we would go up the creek a mile above camp and put out the bee bait, burn more honey comb, and leave the bee box on the stand and await results. In the meantime we would take a couple of bear traps and go on to a ridge and set them. It might be possible that we would get a bear, although we had not seen any bear signs on what ground we had been over. We took the traps, Smoky carrying them, while I carried the bait. The hill was high and rough and I found it about all that I was able to do to climb although I went very slow and rested often. I did not complain, for Smoky was doing all the complaining necessary for both of us. He said that we would not catch a darn thing unless it was a cold, and he didn't think that we would get that much. It proved later that Smoky was wrong in his reckonings. We set the two bear traps in as likely places as we could find for bear to travel, and put in the balance of the day traveling through the woods in search of bear signs. Not a track or sign could we find, and when we reached camp at night I was seemingly more dead than alive. The next morning after we had left the bee bait on the old road bed and then climbed the hill to set the two bear traps, Smoky said that we would go down to Hull's, a distance of about three miles, and see if he could get cans to put the extracted honey in. We had made a sack from two towels and had begun to strain or extract the honey from the comb and had the water pail nearly full of strained honey, and were sorely in need of the pail to carry water in. When I got to where we had left the bee bait, on the old road bed, I found plenty of bees at work. I soon got the line which went up the stream and a little to the left of the road and directly toward two large soft maple trees, the only trees of any size in that direction for a long distance. I said to myself, a quick job for you must be in one or the other of those maples. I left the bait and went to look for the bees in one of the two trees. When I came to the trees, bees came to me in great numbers, but I could not see a bee going in or out in either. I was satisfied that the bees were in one of the trees, but after looking for a long time I thought that I must be mistaken, that the bees were farther on and up on the side of the hill. I gave it up and moved the bait up the road to a point about opposite where the line would strike the hillside and where several trees were left standing, making a good opening by cutting away the brush. I then released the bees from the box. After they had done much circling I was quite sure I saw two or three of them swing back in the direction of the soft maple trees. I left the box and went along the creek in search of mink or coon signs, so as to give the bees time to get the bait well located, as they will then fly so much steadier and without doing so much circling. When I returned to the bait, the bees were flying steadily in the direction of the two soft maples and there could be no mistake this time. I took the bait down and placed it in the road opposite the two soft maples and began the second time to search the trees. After looking a long time without seeing bees going to or from the trees, I was again compelled to give it up. I began searching among the old timber, old stumps and stubs, as it was in the midst of an old bark slashing. I would search among the old down trees a while and then look over the two soft maples. I had kept up this search from 9 o'clock in the morning until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. When I was approaching the two maple trees from the southwest side I readily discovered bees going into the tree close to and just above a large branch or prong of the tree which made it impossible to see them until the sun was just in the right position to shine square on the place where the bees entered the tree. In my younger days I always carried a pair of climbers and a rope, so that when I found it difficult to locate the particular tree that the bees were in, when they were in thick timber, I could climb any tree no difference how large and locate the bees. This would often save much time in finding a bee tree. I would often climb a tree that stood in a favorable place on the bee line and cut off the top of the tree and make the bee stand up 30 or 40 feet from the ground. This I found a great advantage in lining bees in a thick, bushy section. That day is past with me for I am too clumsy to climb any more. When I got to camp, I found Smoky at work putting the honey that was strained into cans and he said that he had concluded to change his name from Smoky Jim to Sticky Jim. We concluded to let bee hunting go for a day or two and set two more bear traps south of camp, although we had seen no signs of bear. Hear I will mention one of Smoky's dry remarks. We took two bear traps and bait for them following up a hollow south from camp to the top of a ridge where there was quite a large clump of green timber still standing. When we came to the head of the hollow and near the top of the ridge where we thought would be a good place to set a bear trap, I pointed to a small scraggly beech sapling and told Smoky to cut it. Then to cut off a piece six or eight feet long for a clog. Also to measure the size of the ring in the trap chain and cut the clog off so that when the ring was put down over the end of the clog, sixteen or eighteen inches to a prong, it would fit the ring fairly close. This would make the ring or chain secure to the clog, as it would give the ring no chance to work about, while I would make a bed to set the trap in and have the trap set by the time that he got the clog ready. It was now that I found that Smoky had brought a small hatchet weighing less than one-half pound instead of the larger belt axe, but there was nothing to do only to cut the clog with the little hatchet. So Smoky went to work cutting the clog while I went to setting the traps. After a while Smoky came with the clog and he had cut it off where it was considerably too large for the ring in the chain. I said, ""Smoky, I guess you did not size that ring or the clog very much for you have got it much too large."" Smoky replied readily, ""Yes I did too, the tree has grown that much since I began to chop it."" After a time we managed to get the two traps set and got back to camp. That night about 10 o'clock, Smoky woke me with a punch in the ribs and at the same time saying, ""Get your gun, the whole Siwash tribe of Indians are on us."" On the impulse of the moment I though Smoky was right for I could hear many voices and the barking and snarling of dogs. In a moment all that had ever happened to me and many things that never did, nor can happen, passed through my mind but it was only for a moment when some one called out at the tent door saying, ""Get up, you have visitors."" We asked who was there and the reply was, ""Oh get up, two sleeps is better than one any time."" I got up and put on my pants and unbuckled the tent door and there stood a half dozen men and as many more dogs. Two of the men had a large demijohn strung on a pole and they were carrying it on their shoulders, two more of the men had coons slung over their shoulders. The boys said that they were out coon hunting and by chance ran into our camp and thought that they would call on us and learn what we were doing. The demijohn contained cider, and the barking of the dogs was caused by getting into trouble over scraps that had been thrown about camp. We invited the boy in and asked them to tell what luck they had had hunting coon. They said that they had only got the two coons on their way up, but thought that they would do better on their way back down the creek. The boys lived about six miles down the stream. The creek ran close along the wagon road nearly all the way so the boys would follow along the road allowing the dogs to hunt along the creek for coon. The boys concluded to stay and eat their lunch before starting back. We made them a cup of hot coffee and set out a plate of honey and the boys ate their lunch, drank cider, and told stories until nearly 1 o'clock. They said that they had had a dandy time hunting coon along the last of September while coon were working on the corn and they said that they had killed about 30 and one wildcat. I asked if they did not think September rather early in the season to kill coon? They said that they thought that there was as much sport in it in September as at any other time of the year. I asked if there was any more sport in coon hunting in September than there was later in the season? They said that they did not know that there was. I replied that then they were out at least one-half or more on the price of the skins. They replied that it would be a queer jay that would put off a coon hunt a month for the difference that there might be in the price of a coon skin. I saw that I was up against it and that my argument had no weight in the matter, so I dropped it. When told that we were putting in our time mostly hunting bees, the boys said that we were losing the best time of our lives by not having some good coon dogs along with us, and Smoky quite agreed with them. However, I could not see it in that light. After the boys left, Smoky and I had to laugh over the boys' jolly time until near daybreak before we could get to sleep again and we quite agreed with the boys that the second sleep was better than the first. It was now the first of November and we had not put out any small traps, as the weather was still very warm and dry for the season of the year. Each day we could see away off to the southwest by the black heavy smoke that the forest fires that had been burning in that direction were coming nearer and nearer to us. Smoky said that he thought that a coon skin in October was worth as much as in November. He said by the time that we could get our traps out the forest fires would have the whole country burned over and all the game driven out. Smoky was not far from the mark in his prophesying. We now began to put out the small traps at as good a ""jag"" as I was able to stand the travel. We had, while bee hunting at odd times, selected and prepared many of the sets so that we were now able to set out many more traps in a day than we could have done had we not fixed and selected many places for sets. The fourth day of November was a very warm day in Potter County, and as we had not tried to get any bees west of camp, I told Smoky that we had better let the balance of the traps go for a day and try the bees in that direction as it was not likely that we would have many more days that bees would fly during the season. We went about one-half mile west of camp and put out the bee bait and burned more comb. It was not long before a bee came to the bait and then another and another, until we had several at work. As soon as the first bee that came was loaded up and began to make preparations to go, I told Smoky to keep a good eye on him to see which way he went, as the quicker we got a line the quicker we could move on. When the bee first started from the bait, he jagged off east, then he circled so that neither Smoky nor I could tell which way he went. I told Smoky that I was afraid that the bee went back up the creek toward a tree we had already found. Smoky said that he did not know what made me think so, for no one could tell which direction that bee went. I told Smoky that I had always noticed that the way that the bee first started when leaving the bait was pretty sure to be in the direction of the tree and to get in position so that he could see well if the bee should fly back up the creek as we had no time to spare on bees flying in that direction. It was not long before we had bees a-plenty and they came from a tree that we had already found. I told Smoky that we would leave some bait there so that those bees would not follow us, and we would move down the creek some distance before we would try for more. We moved nearly a mile, and while I was fixing a stand--there was no stump or good place to set the box--so I cut a stick about four feet long, an inch in diameter and split the top end into four parts, or in other words quartered the stick, then with two small sticks the size of a lead pencil, pressed down in between these quarters. It spread them so as to form plenty of space to set the box on. The other end of the stick is sharpened to drive firmly into the ground. As I was about to say, while I was fixing the stand, Smoky discovered a bee working on a witch-hazel bush close by the stand. Smoky said that he thought that the bee must have the rheumatism and was gathering Pond's Extract to bathe his joints in (it is with this shrub that Pond's Extract is made) and this was the cause of Smoky making the remark, I suppose. It was necessary to burn comb here as we soon had three or four bees at work on the bait and in a short time we had bees a-plenty. They flew just to the right of the wagon road in a westerly direction and on to the side of a very steep hill where there was considerable standing timber. We soon got the course of the bees' flight, but there seemed to be two lines, as some of the bees would fly to the left of a large tree that stood Just on the bank of the road, while others would fly to the right of the tree. This caused Smoky to remark that we had another sticky job on our hands, saying that there was two different lines. I told Smoky that I thought not. It was all the same bees and that the bees would soon all be flying to the left or lower side of the tree. Smoky wished to know how I made that out. I explained that I thought the bees were around the point of the hill and up a side draft that came into the main hollow some sixty rods below where we were and that the bees that were flying to the right of the tree flew in a direct line to the tree by flying up over the point of the hill then down into the hollow; those that flew to the left of the tree flew around the point of the hill and up the hollow to their tree. Smoky laughed at my idea and said that bees always flew in a straight line--does not everybody say as straight as a bee-line? I told Smoky that was all very well in a level and open country. That a bee knew that it was no farther around the rim of a kettle than up over the bail; that a bee was far too wise to carry a load up over a hill when he could get there in the same distance on a level; that bees in their flight would often vary their course and fly along the side of a hill to keep out of a strong wind until they were nearly opposite the tree, when they would make nearly a square turn to the tree. That they would also vary their flight from a straight line to follow an opening as a road cut out through the thick woods. The flight of the bees, as I suspected, was soon all to the left of the tree standing on the bank of the road. We moved the bait down to the mouth of the side draft and soon had a line flying nearly up the hollow. I told Smoky to take the bees some forty rods up the hollow and make a stand while I would follow and inspect the trees that looked favorable. Soon Smoky halloed to me and said that the bees had nearly all left him. I told him to make the stand where he was. As he had passed the tree that was the cause of the bees dropping off all at once. Just below where Smoky was and a little up on the bank from the hollow stood a large maple tree. I started to inspect the tree. Bees were flying all about me and as soon as I was near enough to the tree to see, I could see bees flying all about the tree, some forty feet from the ground. I called to Smoky and told him that the bees were treed in a large maple. This was on the fourth day of November and was a very rare thing for bees to be working at that time of the year in this section of the country. This tree made the sixth bee tree that we had found while in camp. This ended our bee hunting and we now put in the balance of the time, while in camp, with the traps. It will now be necessary to go back to the 20th of October to a time that Smoky said was the biggest day of his life. On the 20th of October we started out to look at the bear traps with little hopes of getting anything more than a porcupine. Up to this time we had not seen any signs of bear, only what had been made during the summer, where the bear had dug out woodchucks and torn old logs to pieces in search of grubs, and where they had dug wild turnips. These signs were so old that we had but little hopes of getting a bear while in camp and Smoky was continually condemning the country. We went up along a hollow that led to the top of a high ridge where we had a bear trap setting and where I thought was the most likely place to catch a bear, but found the trap undisturbed. We next crossed a narrow ridge where we had another trap. The trap was set in a spring run and the banks on either side of the run were quite thickly grown up with low brush. Smoky was in advance a few steps so that when he came to the edge of the thick brush that grew on the bank of the run, parted the brush and looked through at the trap, he caught a glimpse of some black object moving in the run. He quickly stepped back and held up his hand, his eyes sparkling with excitement and he whispered to me, ""By Moses, we have got him."" Smoky being given to much joking, I asked, ""What have we got?"" for I had not heard any noise of any kind. Smoky said, ""A bear, by long horn spoon-handle."" I stepped past Smoky and looked through the brush and there was a large black porcupine moving about a little in the trap. I stepped back and said to Smoky, ""Well, shoot him."" Smoky said, ""No, I will miss him. You shoot him,"" at the same time handing me the gun. I now saw that Smoky was in earnest and surely thought we had a bear and I burst out with laughter. Smoky was amazed and said, ""You blooming simpleton, what is the matter with you?"" The look of anxiety and the manner in which Smoky spoke still caused me to laugh the harder. When I could cease laughing long enough to tell Smoky what was in the trap, Smoky's change of looks of excitement and anxiety to one of disgust was pitiful. Smoky began to condemn the country and tell how foolish we were to come to such a forsaken place as that was to trap where there was nothing but porcupines. After resetting the trap we went on to the third trap, which was setting about a mile farther north. It was necessary to cross two narrow ridges in order to reach the trap. Smoky was in a moody state of mind and lagged along behind, hunting partridges, killing two or three. When we reached the top of the second ridge and the trap was in the hollow beyond, I heard some sort of a noise where the trap was setting, but I was unable to tell what it was. Smoky was behind somewhere on the line, but while I stood listening he came on in great haste. He had heard the same noise and was hurrying up to inquire what it was. I told him that I was unable to tell just what it was, but was afraid that some dog had got caught in the trap as the sound came from the direction in which the trap was. Smoky said that it was a different noise than he had ever heard a dog make. I told Smoky that I feared that it was some hound that was in the trap and was making the pitiful sort of a howl and that we must hurry on and get him out of the trap. When we were half way down the side of the hill, the noise ceased, but I could now see that the noise came from some distance farther down the run than where the trap had been set and I knew that no dog could move the trap and clog. We now went a little more quietly. I soon got sight of Bruin rolling and tumbling in a bunch of small birch saplings where the trap clog was fast, good and stout. Smoky had not got his eye onto the bear yet, when I stopped and pointed in the direction of the bear and said, ""Smoky, there is the gentleman that you have been so anxious to see."" Smoky had not yet got his eye onto the bear and he said, ""That's no darned dog that makes that noise. What is it? I don't see anything."" ""No, Smoky, it is no dog; neither is it a porky; it is a bear this time all right."" I pointed at the clump of yellow birches and said, ""Don't you see him down in the gulch there?"" When Smoky got his eye on the bear, you should have seen them sparkle. This was the first bear that Smoky had ever seen outside of captivity. When I told Smoky that we would go up close to the bear and he (Smoky) should shoot it, he again reached the gun to me and again insisted that I should shoot it, saying that he would surely miss it, the same as he declared in the case of the porcupine. I told Smoky that he had plenty of cartridges and that it would be some time before it would be too dark to see to shoot and that he must shoot the bear. It took a great deal of urging to get Smoky to shoot, he declaring all the time that he knew he would miss it. I said, ""Smoky, you must not shoot at the bear but at the base of the bear's ear,"" which he finally did and Bruin was out of his trouble almost before the smoke from the rifle had cleared away. The bear was a large one, measuring seven feet two inches from end to end. We were unable to get it out of the woods whole. Smoky insisted that he would carry it if it was as large as a mountain. He soon gave up that idea and we cut the carcass into pieces and took part to camp and returned the next day after the balance. That night after we got to camp with the bear we had for supper bear steak, partridge, rabbit and bacon with warm biscuits and honey, baked potatoes, butter and coffee, with the necessary trimmings, which caused Smoky to remark that the country was all right for a living, but thought that society was rather limited. The day after we had brought in the remainder of the bear, we could see the smoke from the forest fires that were burning away to the southwest, loom up thick and black. It was plainly to be seen that the fire was steadily working in the direction of our camp and was getting in close proximity to where we had a bear trap setting. I was afraid that the fire would burn sufficiently hard to spoil the trap unless it was taken up, so Smoky said that if I would ""mix the muligan"" (get supper) that he would go and get the trap, which I readily consented to do, telling Smoky to bring the trap down to a small creek and put the trap in the water. Smoky got back about the time I had supper ready. He came in and put his gun up and washed ready for supper without saying a word. I saw that Smoky was looking down-hearted but thought that he was a little tired and homesick, so I did not say much to him, but after a little I said, ""Charley, did you get anything in the trap?"" He answered very short, saying, ""If I had you would be likely to see something of it, wouldn't you?"" so I said no more. After supper was over and the dishes washed, Smoky took a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me with the remark, ""What do you know about that?"" I unfolded the paper and found that it contained a lock of bear's hair. I said, ""Smoky, what is it? Another one of your jokes?"" I thought that Smoky had taken the hair from the bear that we had caught two days before. Smoky remarked that he thought that the joke was on him as much as anyone, and then explained that a bear had been in the trap and he got out. He described the circumstances, and it was plain to be seen that the guide or stepping stick had been placed a little too close to the trap which had caused the bear to step his foot partly over on to the jaw of the trap and had only been caught by the heel, which was not sufficient to hold him, although Smoky said that the bear had put up quite a fight before it had got out. Smoky said that when he came to where the trap was set and found it gone, he thought he would have the biggest time of his life. A bear all by himself, and when he found that the bear had got away, he felt like throwing himself into the creek along with the trap. I told Charley not to take the matter to heart so, for if he followed the trap line and the trail very long that he would have many a slip just at the time that he thought he had the game bagged. The next morning the fire was sweeping over the whole country so we hustled around and pulled all of the traps that were not setting in the water or that were not out of reach of the fire. The fire put an end to trapping for everything but a few mink along the stream. I wish to speak of one of Smoky's dry remarks. Smoky is a strong Republican. A few days after the Presidential election we were going up a small draft to look after three or four traps that I had set for fox. The first trap that we came to was undisturbed. The second one was lying at the side of the brook all in a bunch, chain and all. Plain to be seen that it had been dropped there by human hands. As soon as I saw the trap I said, ""Smoky, some one has dropped that trap there."" ""There has been some animal in it and it has gotten out, see, there is blood on the jaws."" ""Very true, Smoky, there has been some animal in the trap, but human hands took it out, for no animal leaves a trap, clog and all, lying free in that way, with the trap chain slack in that way."" It only required a glance about to see that there had been a coon in the trap and had been fast. Just up on the bank there lay the club that they had used to kill the coon with. After giving my opinion of the gentleman that had taken the coon, I began to reset the trap again where it was before. Smoky objected to again setting the trap there only for some one else to get the game again, but I told Smoky that lightning rarely struck twice in the same place so we would set the trap again. We started up the hollow and were soon discussing politics again until we came to where the next trap was setting. Just before we came to the trap, Smoky picked up an empty cartridge shell. A few yards farther on lay the second trap which had had a fox in it, as was plain to be seen by the tooth marks on the small brush and by the fur on the trap. That the fox had been shot was evident by the amount of fur that was lying on the ground where the animal had been caught. This was more than I could stand without giving vent to my feelings. After trying for some time to find words to give the case justice, and failing, Smoky remarked with all the coolness imaginable, that there was one thing certain about it, that it was a Democrat that took the fox and coon. I was astonished at the remark and asked what he meant. ""Well, if it had been a Republican that had taken them, he would have taken the traps, too."" We were now getting our trap line down to a few traps along the main creek, and we now worked those traps to the best of our skill, as we wished to get our share of the mink. We had not put out any mink traps until the first of November. The weather had been very dry and warm but as it had now turned cold and I found that I could not stand the cold as I once could, I told Smoky that we would take what mink pelts we could get in a few days and pull stakes. Smoky replied that that sort of ""chin music"" suited him. So after ten or twelve days of mink trapping we pulled the rest of the traps and went home, having to my idea a pleasant time. Smoky agreed that the time was all right but he thought that the society was a little slow for him, saying that if it had not been for the boys on the coon hunt we would not have seen a half dozen persons since we had been in camp. We had not made a large catch of furs but I thought that we had done fairly well, all things considered (one old played-out trapper and a kid who had never set a trap for anything greater than a muskrat or a ground hog). [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS CATCH.] We had caught while in camp one bear, ten mink, eight coon and some other furs as shown in the accompanying picture. After we left I set a few traps about home, catching three fox and a few skunk and four more mink, making fourteen mink in all. We got $4 and $4.50 for the fox, and $4 to $6 for the mink, and from 80 cents to $2.25 for skunk, and about the same for coon. We got 30 to 40 cents each for muskrats. This will about complete the story of my trapping for the season of 1908. I am sorry that I am no artist, as I could have sent some fine pictures, consisting of the bear in trap, as well as many other animals in traps, and other pictures that would have been interesting had I been able to take them at the right time and place. CHAPTER XVI. Hits and Misses on the Trail. Many years ago when deer were plenty in this section of the country (North Central Pennsylvania) and dogs were allowed to run deer at their will, there being no restriction by way of law against hounding deer, I started from the house about 10 o'clock in the morning to go to some traps that I had set for mink along the creek in a swamp not far from our place. There was an old road or path that led from the wagon road down through the swamp to the creek. Along this path it was thickly grown up with laurel and other underbrush that nearly shut out the path. I was accustomed to follow this path to the creek when going to look after my traps. On my way up to the road I heard dogs barking as though they were on the trail of something, but thought nothing of it as it was a common occurrence to hear hounds running nearly every day. I was following this path and had got within a few rods of the creek and was just about ready to climb over a fallen tree that lay across the path. The tree lay up from the ground about a foot or so and it was perhaps three feet from the ground up to the top of the log. I was just in the act of climbing this log when a good-sized buck deer went to jump the log also and we met, head on. I had no gun and if I had would have had no time to use it. I seized the deer by the horns and forced him back from the log with a startled cry at the same time. The deer, instead of trying to get away, seemed bound to come over the log to where I was, so I held to the deer's horns, not daring to let loose. I could keep him from raising over the log and after he tried several times to jump the log, he then tried to break loose from me, but I had the advantage of the deer owing to the log being so high that the deer could not pull me over, neither could the deer get in shape to strike me with his feet under the log. I think that I was so badly frightened at the sudden meeting with the deer, that I did not know what to do so I hung tight to the buck's horns and called as loud as I could for help, thinking that some one might possibly be passing along the road, which was not so far away, hear my call and come to my assistance, but no one came. A man by the name of Nelson lived about a fourth of a mile away, who had a large bulldog. The dog's name was Turk. This dog would follow me at every chance that he could get. As no assistance came, I had about made up my mind to release my hold on the deer as my strength was fast leaving me, when I thought to call for Turk. I began calling as loud as I could and it seemed that the dog had heard my calling before I began, for almost before I was aware of his presence the dog sprang over the log and seized the deer by the hind leg, but the dog had barely grabbed the deer when the deer kicked him away from the path into the laurel. In an instant the dog, with an angry yelp, jumped and seized the deer by the throat and in a moment the deer ceased to struggle and began to settle to the ground. As soon as I dared to release my hold on the deer's horns I got my pocket knife out and sprang over the log and ran the knife blade into the deer's throat. The deer did not seem to notice the knife. I think that the dog had choked the life out of him. The battle was over and it was only a few minutes but it was the hardest battle that I ever had and the dog came to my assistance none too soon for I could not have held on much longer. This did not end the fight, for I had hardly begun to dress the deer before two dogs that were in pursuit of the deer came up. I was compelled to use sticks, stones and clubs to break up a fight between the bulldog and the hounds, though I finally got the row broke up and drove the hounds off in order to keep peace. Boys, I am not sure whether the incident just related would be called a hit or a miss. I will tell of an incident that I call a hit. A man by the name of Wells and a brother of mine were camping near the old Jersey Shore turnpike and were trapping, also hunting deer. One day they had been off on the west side of the turnpike setting marten traps and had built a number of deadfalls and had also set several steel traps for foxes. On their way home to camp they had to cross several low ridges which were good sections for deer. It was nearly sundown and just the right time for deer to be on their feet feeding so we spread out along one of the ridges in hopes that some of us might get a shot. There was a good tracking snow and deer tracks were plenty. We were on the last ridge before we dropped off into the hollow to where the camp was and it was beginning to get dark in the heavy timber. I had come out onto a short spur of the ridge and was standing looking over the ground very carefully to see if I could not see a deer feeding, when I heard a shot fired by one of the boys. In a few moments a bunch of five or six deer came in sight, making their way around the point at breakneck speed. I opened fire on the bunch without taking aim at any particular deer, as it was too dark to get down to real business and the deer were in too much of a hurry to change their feeding grounds to give me very much of a show. I was not stingy of my ammunition and pumped lead at the bunch as long as I could guess where the deer were. As soon as I had ceased to waste ammunition I heard my brother calling for me. When I got to him he was at work taking the entrails out of a good sized buck. We dragged the deer down to where the deer were when I began shooting to see if I had chanced to hit one of the bunch. It was too dark to see much but we found a little blood on the snow in one place but concluded that I had not done much damage. We dragged the buck that my brother had killed to camp, got our supper and made plans for the next day's work. It was agreed that I should look after the bunch of deer and see what effect my shots had on the deer that we had found that had bled some. I was to work this bunch of deer while the other boys went to look after the marten traps, being quite sure that there would be a marten or two in the traps, for we had built some deadfalls where we saw fresh marten signs quite plenty. The next morning I was up early and had breakfast before daylight and ready to start out and carry out the work as already planned. It was about one-fourth of a mile from camp to the turnpike and as the deer which I was going to look for were making their course, the last I had seen them, in the direction of the road, I was going to go to the road and then go north along the road to see if they had crossed. The boys would take the same path to the road that I did when they would go south of camp to look after the marten traps. I had my gun and stood in the cabin door waiting for my brother and Wells to get ready as I would accompany them as far as the road. The boys were having some trouble belting their leggins and creepers on to their satisfaction. I became tired of waiting and made the remark that I could go and kill a deer before they could get their feet dressed. My brother said that I had better be going then, so I started on up the path to the road. It was thawing a little, just enough to make the snow pack. I had gone about a hundred yards from camp when I saw a track of a deer where it had stepped into the path, then had turned back about forty yards to the left of the path. A large birch tree had blown down, knocking one or two smaller trees down so that it made a little jam. Seeing that the tracks were so fresh I knew that the deer was close by and as the woods were open I was quite positive that the deer must be about the jam of trees, when a large doe stepped out in sight and it was only the work of a moment to let her down in her tracks. When the gun cracked out jumped a yearling buck that was lying down just in the edge of the jam and bounded over the trunk of a large birch and stopped broadside to me and I let him down. Thinking of what I had said on leaving the cabin and what my brother had said to me I ran back to camp as quick as I could go without even stopping to cut the deer's throat. As I came around the corner of the cabin I heard my brother say to Wells, ""I bet a gander that he has killed a deer all right, for he would not shoot twice so quick at anything else."" Well, the boys had not got their feet dressed yet, but chance had allowed me to make my word good only I had killed two deer instead of one. The boys helped me to hang up the deer and then went to the marten traps while I went in search of the deer I had started after. Soon I struck the trail of the deer and shortly saw that one of them had a broken leg and I did not follow the trail far when the wounded deer dropped out and left the others. I began doing the creeping act and soon found the deer lying on his trail. I hung the deer up and went back to camp thinking that I had enough sport for one day and would let well enough alone. When the boys came in at night they brought in two marten skins. CHAPTER XVII. Lost in the Woods. One writer contends that the pocket compass is but very little use to a man in a dense forest. This, I think, depends largely upon circumstances. While the writer has spent a good portion of fifty years almost continuously in the woods, he has seldom found it necessary to use a compass to guide him out. Now this is due partly to the natural faculty of locating any particular place. This faculty of locating any certain place or point by giving or knowing the proper direction to take after one has traveled all day or for several days in the woods, I am inclined to credit to a sort of natural instinct. I have often thought of the story of the Indian who was met by a man in the woods who asked the Indian if he was lost. The reply was, ""No, me ain't lost, wigwam lost, me here."" Now I can say without boasting that it is seldom that the camp or a given point gets lost with me, while it is not an uncommon occurrence for the writer to get lost or rather bothered himself in a strange locality. But after a moment's thought, I say the camp or the point I wish to reach is in that direction, and it is not often that I miss my calculation. As I have had several occasions to search for parties lost in the woods, I wish to relate a particular instance of one man who was lost. It was an uncle of mine by the name of Nelson, and the writer went in search of him. To illustrate that those who are lost lose their heads as soon as they find that they do not know where they are. Now I wish to say that if you lost your course or get bothered in your bearings, do not lose your head, for if you do you are lost, but keep cool and keep your head. Sit down and fill your pipe, and while you smoke draw a map of the country carefully in your mind, and almost invariably you will locate yourself and in so doing will locate the camp. To get back to the lost man in question whose name was Amos Fish, and at the time, was the proprietor of the Cherry Springs Hotel, in this county. This hotel was located in the heart of the largest forest in Pennsylvania, and originally was a great resort for hunters from all over the state as well as southern and western New York. (The time of which I write was somewhere in the 60's--have forgotten exact date.) There were several men boarding at this hotel and my uncle and myself were among the number boarding with Mr. Fish, hunting, as were other boarders. This hotel stood in the center of a field containing perhaps eighty acres of cleared land, and there was not another clearing or a building within a distance of seven miles. One morning after there had been a fall of four or five inches of snow, which made fine tracking, Mr. Fish thought that he would go out that morning and try and kill a deer. He left the house going through the field in nearly a due east course. After going about one mile he crossed a stream which ran in a north and south direction. Mr. Fish had fished this stream for trout many a time. After crossing this stream Mr. Fish crossed a broad ridge and went on to a small stream known as the Sunken Branch, and a tributary of the stream Mr. Fish had previously crossed. Now Mr. Fish was fairly well acquainted with the location which he was in, but in his search for deer he had got a little mixed in his whereabout and at once lost his head. My uncle when coming in from hunting that evening crossed Mr. Fish's track on the ridge near the head of the Sunken Branch, and had heard him shoot several times but supposed that he was shooting at deer. When the hunters all got in that night and Mr. Fish failed to appear, the matter was discussed by the hunters from all points of view. It was generally thought that Mr. Fish had had good luck killing deer and had been detained in dressing and hanging them up, or that he had wounded a deer and had been led a long way from home in getting it. When it got well along in the evening and Mr. Fish failed to come then it was feared that he had met with some misfortune. No one would believe that he was lost, as it was known that he was pretty well acquainted with the woods in the direction that he had been known to take. But as the time went on and still Mr. Fish did not come, we all began to fear for his safety, as the night was very cold, so every few minutes some one would go out and fire a gun. This was continued all night, though there was no answer. My uncle and myself had an early breakfast and started some time before daybreak for the locality in which uncle had seen Mr. Fish's tracks and heard gun shots which were thought to have been fired by him. Shortly after daybreak we found the track of a man which we could readily see had been made during the night. After following the track some distance we were convinced that we were following the track of Mr. Fish and he was lost, for his tracks would go in a zigzag sort of a circle and crossing his tracks previously made. After we had followed Mr. Fish's track for an hour or longer we saw him coming nearly towards us with his hat in his hand. We stood still and he came close to us before he seemed to notice us. He had no gun, and when he stopped he stared at us and did not seem to know us. Uncle then spoke to him and said, ""Amos, what is the matter, are you lost?"" Mr. Fish replied that he wanted to go to the Cherry Springs Hotel. In a few minutes after eating a good lunch which we had carried with us for that purpose, he seemed to know us. When questioned as to what he had done with his gun, he apparently had forgotten that he ever had a gun. But after a time seemed to remember the gun in a vague sort of way, and said that he must have left it by a tree but could not tell in what direction the tree was. After a search of a half hour we found the gun standing by a tree where apparently Mr. Fish had traveled around for some time. When we came to the creek on our way to the house and at the place where Mr. Fish had crossed it in the morning before, he asked what stream it was. When told that it was the place where he had crossed the creek the morning before and asked if he did not remember the creek as he had fished there many a time, he said that he had no recollection of ever seeing the stream before. Shortly we came out into the field and Mr. Fish did not know his own house. Asked who lived there and did not seem to recognize his own home until he had been inside the house for several minutes with his family. I have related this instance of Mr. Fish to show how necessary it is for one who has got slightly mixed in his course to keep cool and not allow himself to become excited. If he does he immediately loses his head and is at once lost, as in the case of Mr. Fish. He was at no time more than four miles from his house, and was quite familiar with the ground he was on during the whole time. He was lost while following the deer that he was in pursuit of. They led him into a windfall perhaps containing one hundred acres, and it was while in this that he became bothered as to the right course to go to his house. He at once lost his head, or more proper, his reasoning faculties, and at once became lost. Mr. Fish was east of the ridge and road and as he had a compass, all there was for him to do was to consult the compass and go west to the road, but Mr. Fish declared that his compass would not work, and it might have been possible that he held the compass so close to the gun barred that the compass did not work properly. In my more than fifty years' life in the woods as a trapper and hunter, it has been my lot to search for several persons lost in the woods. Once in these same woods I searched for three weeks for a little child four years old. At first the search for days was carried on by more than a hundred men, then another man and myself continued, then my companion gave it up. I continued alone for days, but there has never been a trace of the child seen or heard of, since its grandmother last saw the little fellow sitting on the door step eating a piece of bread and butter on the morning of its disappearance, along in the early 80's. To speak of the use of the pocket compass, I would say to the trapper or hunter that where he can it is best to locate his camp when in a section of a country where the woods are very large, and the trapper or hunter is not well acquainted with the locality, on a stream or in a valley of considerable size, or near a public highway or some landmark that is readily recognized by the trapper. Even thought it may be after nightfall, for the thrifty trapper or hunter will oftener find himself on the trail after the stars are shining than he will in camp before dark. Now it is quite necessary that the camper should first acquaint himself with these land marks for some distance either side of his camp (when I say some distance I mean miles) and especially get the general course or direction that the stream runs or other landmarks, for this is where the real use of the pocket compass comes in play. Now when you start out place out a line of traps or on the trail of a deer or other animal, all that there is to be done is to know whether you are on the south, north or other direction, as the case may be, from this valley or other landmarks. Now the trapper or hunter soon becomes so accustomed to traveling in the woods that when he makes up his mind to strike for camp, he can tell about how long it will take him to reach this valley that the camp is located in. When the time comes to go to camp consult the compass, and as it is known what direction to take to hit the camp, or at least the stream or other landmark on which the camp is located. Yes, boys, if any one is in the habit of getting lost the pocket compass is a very useful instrument in finding the way, providing it is properly used. Let me say, however, that no matter how often ""the shanty gets lost,"" don't lose your head, for if you do, the compass or the landmarks will do you no good. CHAPTER XVIII. Traps and Other Hints for Trappers. All trappers have their favorite traps--the writer has his. Every boy knows that the Newhouse trap is at the top of the ladder, as to quality, but as to convenience, well, I prefer the No. 1 1/2 Oneida Jump trap, which is superior to all others on the market for small game. This trap is now made with jaws much thicker than the original ""Jump"" (Blake & Lamb), and the way the chain is now fastened gives the animal a straight draw instead of a twist, as was the case with the Blake & Lamb style. The Oneida Jump however, is lacking in strength of the springs, being much weaker than the Blake & Lamb of the same size but in all other ways I consider it far better than the original Blake & Lamb. The spring being so much weaker than the Blake & Lamb springs were, is a serious drawback, as the Oneida Jump trap of this size will not hold a large raccoon or a large fox. Now, while many trappers might not seriously object to the trap on these grounds as they use many different sizes of traps or a different size of trap for each animal. This I never do in trapper the smaller animals, for when I make a dry or ground set, I set the trap for any animal from the fox to the coon or wildcat, although I may be more particular making the set for mink. It makes a trapper feel sore to go to a trap and find that a fox or coon has been in his trap and escaped. This rarely if ever occurs when using the Blake & Lamb No. 1 1/2 trap, or as the original was called No. 2, though it had the same spread of jaws as the No. 1 1/2 Oneida Jump. Now the advantages that the Oneida Jump trap has over the long spring trap are many. The most desirable are perhaps the easy manner in which the ""jump"" trap can be concealed. In fact, a practical set can be made in certain places where it is entirely impracticable to make the set with a long spring trap. Another advantage that the ""jump"" trap has over the bow or long spring trap is its comparison to the long spring trap in shipping by express. This, if going on a long journey, to your trapping grounds, is not safe by freight, as the trapping season may be over before your traps reach you. Still another advantage is the amount of room saved in packing, for you can pack two of the ""jump"" traps in the same space required to pack one long spring trap. The writer has had a good deal of experience in this matter and knows the difference in handling the two makes of traps. Now I do not like to use the double spring ""jump"" trap where I am trapping, for I might possibly catch a dog or other domestic animal and it is a hard trap to get a live animal out of. Many, perhaps most trappers use the No. 1 trap for trapping mink, muskrat, marten, etc. The No. 1 Newhouse or Victor is sufficiently strong for these animals but as I have stated, I do not think this the best plan if the trapper is operating on grounds where there are larger animals to be taken, as most frequently the one set can be made to catch several kinds of animals. I have found also that one is more liable to catch the animal by the end of the toes in a No. 1 trap than in the No. 1 1/2, but where one is trapping for the purposes of saving the fox, skunk or other animal alive, then the No. 1 trap should be used, as the animal is not so liable to break a leg or to hurt the foot so badly. For otter I prefer the single spring Newhouse trap, owing to the fact that it is more easily concealed than the double spring trap. I see that a number of writers think that the No. 5 bear trap should have a larger spread of jaw so as to catch higher on the bear's foot. Now I do not intend to dictate to others as to what kind of a trap they should use, not in the least, for I have my own ideas as to traps and guns as well as the manner of using them. Now as for myself, I think the Newhouse No. 5 bear trap could not be improved, as to spread of jaws. The grasp is just right to catch the bear through the thick of the foot where there is no danger of the bear twisting the foot off. In case where the trap has a spread of jaws sufficient to grasp above the foot and for more space for the bear to place his foot well between the jaws, will say there is plenty of room in the Newhouse No. 5 trap, if the trap is properly set. I also see that some trappers want the swivel in the trap chain 8 or ten inches from the bed piece, or the point of fastening. Now I am somewhat puzzled as to an explanation in this matter, as it seems to me that the swivel will be far less liable to become useless by being twisted or wound around saplings, etc., where the swivel is close to the bed piece than it would be if placed eight or ten inches out in the chain. I prefer to have the swivel in my trap chain placed as close to the trap as possible. [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS STEEL TRAPS.] Another thing that I have but little use for is a trap from which the animal must take the bait in order to spring it, for often the animal will go up close enough to a trap to inspect the bait but will not touch it. I do not think that there should be a latch on any trap, as I think that often the animal's foot is thrown free from the trap, or at least causes many catches by the tips of the toes and the animal escapes, becoming a hard animal to catch thereafter. The animal having a part of the foot resting on the latch and the toes striking the treadle sufficient to unlatch the treadle, the released jaw will throw the latch with the portion of the animal's foot resting on the latch, free from the trap, or at least may often cause a slight catch of the toes or other part of the foot. All that is necessary is to leave an extension to the arm or heel of the treadle to catch over the jaw of the trap. The trap may be made to spring hard or easy by simply raising the pan slightly higher or lowering it to catch farther on to the jaw of the trap more or less as desired. Now boys, I have given a few of my ideas as to traps, and if any of you have any suggestions to make as to improvements on the animal steel traps, let us hear from you through the columns of the H-T-T. I believe that manufacturers of animal or game traps would be glad to make any improvements on their traps could they be convinced that the suggested improvements were really of any value. * * * As I get many letters from trappers who are beginners in the business making inquiries about camping and the necessary traps, guns, etc., I will try to give a few practical hints to those who have had but limited experience of trapper's life. While, like the setting of a trap, there is no single code of rules that will answer for all localities and conditions, I will give a few general rules. The trapper should first try and inform himself of the nature and conditions of the locality where he intends to trap. If the waters are of such a size that a boat can be used to advantage, then the boat becomes a necessity. Now in regard to traps. If the section where you intend to trap has the larger animals like bear, otter, beaver, etc., then the trapper should provide himself with a sufficient number of traps of different sizes as he may be able to tend and do it well. I would advise to start with, that the trapper has about one-half dozen No. 5 bear traps, one dozen No. 4 wolf and about the same of No. 3. But the greater number of traps will be Numbers 1 1/2 and 2, if of the Jump or Blake & Lamb pattern. If of other patterns would say use the Hawley & Norton Nos. 1 1/2 and 2, say 75 No. 1 1/2 and 25 No. 2. The genuine Newhouse is of course the best long spring trap made, but a little more expensive, and we find that the H. & N. fills the bill. We prefer the B. & L. on account of its lightness and convenience in setting. Now, if the trapper is trapping where the animals are no larger than fox, raccoon, wildcat, etc., then I want no traps larger than the No. 2 1/2, nor smaller than the No. 1 1/2 Blake & Lamb. Now about the gun. If you are in a large game country it is quite necessary that you carry a good rifle. I like the Winchester and not of too large a caliber, but if there is no large game in the locality then I think one should have a Stevens pistol, ten-inch barrel, or a Stevens Pocket Shotgun, 15-inch barrel, and in either case have a good holster to carry it in. As for myself I prefer a Pocket Shotgun. It might be well to have a large shotgun in camp. You will also want your belt axe or hatchet and a good heavy sharp axe at the camp. As for bedding, this will largely depend on what kind of a cabin or camp you have. If you are in a tent, two persons should have not less than six good blankets. If your camp is so situated that you can drive to it with a team or pack horses, then you should have a straw mattress. But if you are in a locality where you can get cedar or hemlock boughs, you should use only the finer boughs. Begin at the foot of the berth and push the larger or butt end of the bough into the ground and then begin the next row so as to lap or shingle onto the first row, and so on until the head of the berth is reached. If you use a tent, I find that it is a good idea to make a skeleton frame of good heavy poles over the tent and about twelve inches above and around the tent and shingle it well with boughs, so that the snow will not fall directly on the tent. It will be a great help in keeping out the cold. But I think it is best to have at least one good log cabin well chinked, mudded and banked. Always select a spot where it is easy to drain away the surface water on all sides of the camp, and if possible have the main camp close to good pure water which is a great protection against malaria. If you are doing a stroke of business so that you will need more than one camp, the others need not be quite so tidy as the main camp, for it is not likely that you will occupy them more than a night or two at a time. Your temporary camps need not be larger than 6 x 8 and quite low, as this will save both fuel and bedding. Do not forget to get up a good supply of wood at all the camps before the trapping season is open, for you will find plenty to do after the trapping season opens without cutting wood. The main camp should be at least 10 x 12 feet inside. A place should be provided for curing furs outside. Furs should never be cured by a fire or in a warm place, for this will have a tendency to curl the ends of the fur and give it a woolly appearance. There can usually be a place fixed either on the outer gable or under the eaves of the cabin to cure the furs. Now, as to the commissary part. You will, of course, to a great extent select the kind and quantity according to the distance and convenience in getting the grub to camp. The camper will find that the most convenient as well as better satisfaction, as a rule, will be found in taking provisions to camp in a crude state, i.e., wheat flour, corn meal, beans, bacon, with the necessary supply of tea, coffee, sugar, good baking powder, salt, pepper and a quantity of rice. If, as I have before stated, the camp is so located as to be of easy access by wagon, then choose a bill-of-fare to your own liking. The medicine box should contain a box of good cathartic pills and a quantity of 2-grain quinine tablets, with any other medicine you may wish. Other necessities about the camp are a good supply of strong cord, a few feet of small rope, a yard or two of muslin, a yard of oilcloth. It may be well to give a few suggestions about a temporary camp for a night, if by chance you should get caught out and unable to reach camp. You should select a place before dark. If a large fallen tree can be found that lies close to the ground where you wish to build the fire it is best. If the log cannot be readily found then select a bank or knoll to build the fire against. First, build the fire out from the log five or six feet where you will make your bed so as to warm the ground. Now set two crotches about four feet high and place a pole in these crotches. Then from this pole place three or four poles, one end on the ground, the other resting on the pole that rests in the crotches. Then place boughs, bark, or anything to break the wind. This shelter will, of course, be placed over the spot where you will make your bed. Now rake the coals and live embers down against the log where you will have the fire for the night. Now place some boughs over the spot where the fire has been and where your bed will be. With this kind of a camp you can get along through a rather chilly night. You should always carry matches wrapped in waxed paper in three or four different places about your person. You may lose your match safe. If convenient, when going into camp, you should take several stretching boards for different kinds of fur with you. If not, you can usually find a tree that will split good and you can split some out. It is usually hard to find withes that are long and straight enough to bend so as to form a good shaped stretcher. You should always aim to stretch and cure the furs you catch in the best manner. In skinning you should rip the animal straight from one heel across to the other and close to the roots of the tail on the under side. Work the skin loose around the bone at the base until you can grasp the bone of the tail with the first two fingers of the right hand while you place the bone between the first two fingers of the left hand. Then by pulling you will draw the entire bone from the tail which you should always do. Sometimes when the animal has been dead some time the bone will not readily draw from the tail. In this case you should cut a stick the size of your finger about eight inches long. Cut it away in the center until it will readily bend so that the two ends will come together. Then cut a notch in each part of the stick just large enough to let the bone of the tail in and squeeze it out. It is necessary to whittle one side of the stick at the notch so as to form a square shoulder. You should have about three sizes of stretching boards for mink and fox. For mink they should be from 4 1/2 inches down to 3 inches and for fox from 6 1/4 inches down to 5 inches wide, and in length the fox boards may be four feet and the mink boards three feet long. The boards should taper slightly down to within 8 inches of the end for fox and then rounded up to a point. The mink boards should be rounded at 4 or 5 inches from this point. You will vary the shape of the board in proportion to the width. Stretching boards should not be more than 3/8 inch thick. A belly strip the length, or nearly the length, of the boards 1 1/4 inches at the wide end, tapering to a point at the other end and about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick. Have the boards smooth and even on the edges. Other stretching boards should be made in proportion to the size and shape of the animal whose skin is to be stretched. You should not fail to remove all the fat and flesh from the skin immediately after the skin is on the board. If a skin is quite wet when taken from the animal it should be drawn lightly on the board until the fur is quite dry. Then turn the skin flesh side out and stretch. It is always best if you can go into the country where you intend to trap. This is especially important if the ground is a new field to you. During the summer or early fall, acquaint yourself with the streams and the general surroundings, and prepare some of your best sets for the mink and the fox. If you have a dog of good intelligence take him along, though he may not be broken to the business of trapping. It is many a fox and coon that my dog has saved for me when they have escaped from footing or a broken chain. If the dog is of much intelligence, and you use care in training him, you will soon find that a dog will learn more about trapping than you supposed possible. If you have long lines of traps your dog will inform you more than once that you have passed a trap that chanced to be a little off the main line. * * * Brother bear trappers, how do you like this style of bear trap (see frontispiece) for toting through the woods three or four miles from camp and at the same time tote a couple of sheep heads or the head of a beef for bait? In times gone by I have carried two or three Newhouse bear traps and bait to bait them with from one to five miles in the woods to pinch old Bruin's toes. Such is a pleasure to any red blooded man, who was born a real lover of the open and the stimulating effect of obtaining that $30 or $40, which the hide and meat of the bear brought, had on the trapper, was nearly equal to the desire to be out in the tall timber. Now brother bear trappers, these traps that you see on my shoulder are of my own make and are made with a half circle bed piece instead of a straight bed piece, as the ordinary trap is made. I wish to call your attention to how this trap fits the shoulders and how much easier it is to carry than the trap with the straight bed piece and note how much more readily you can get your gun into shape for action. Many a deer has given me the slip before I could drop the bear traps and get my gun ready for action when I have been toting bear traps in the woods. But with this style of trap your gun can be put in operation at once, regardless of the traps. Boys, another thing that I have learned in the last five years' experience in trapping in the south, (this was written Spring of 1913) is that it requires a trap a size larger to trap small fur bearers in the south than it does in the north, owing to the difference in conditions of the streams and the soil. Well friend Bachelder, there is no use of you and I talking or worrying any more over our bear traps or bear trapping. The gentleman sportsman and his dog has ordered you and I and all other trappers of Pennsylvania for that matter to cast our traps on to the scrap pile and we must submit. CHAPTER XIX. Camps and Camping. I will say that the conditions and location in which one is to camp makes a great difference in the preparations. If one is just going outside of town to camp for a few days outing, commodities may be to your liking as to quality and quantity. In these days, should the larder run low, it is only necessary for the camper to step out a short distance to a farm house where he is almost sure to find a telephone. In such cases all that the camper has to do is to 'phone to town, ordering his favorite brands delivered to camp, and soon an automobile is on the road laden with supplies, hastening to the campers' relief. Conditions are different when the camper is far from town; or perhaps miles from a dwelling or perhaps even a public road and the camper is compelled to pack his camp outfit, grub stake and all over miles of rough trail, or it may be no trail at all; then the camper must curtail his desires to their utmost limit. If the camper is on strange ground, and the camp is to be permanent or for some weeks, it is best for the camper not to be in too big a hurry to select the camping ground, and take up with any sort of a place. It is even better to make a temporary camp and look the locality over and select a place where good water can be had, and wood for fuel is plentiful and near camp. If possible, select a spot in a thicket of evergreen timber of a second growth and out of the way of any large trees that might blow onto the camp. If the ground is sloping, place your camp parallel with the slope, whether tent or log cabin, as the surface water can more readily be drained off, and not allowed to soak into the ground and cause dampness inside of the tent. A ditch should be dug around the tent to drain all surface water, and eaves so the water will not soak inside. If a log cabin, the dirt from the drain can be thrown up against the logs of the cabin. If the camper expects to camp through cold and snowy weather, it will pay him to place a ridge pole in crotches placed firmly in the ground. The pole should be a foot above the ridge of the tent, then place poles from the ground, the ends resting on this ridge pole as rafters to a building, then nail a few poles to these rafters sufficient to keep boughs from dropping down onto the tent. The boughs should be of an evergreen variety. This outer covering should be well thatched or covered with these boughs. This extra covering adds greatly to the warmth and comfort of the camp, as it protects from the wind blowing directly on the tent, also keeps the snow from falling onto the tent. It is also a great convenience if this ridge pole is allowed to extend out three or four feet, and a strip of canvas run over the pole and down to side poles, so as to form a sort of an awning so one can step outside to wash when it is raining without getting wet. It also makes a convenient place to pile a small amount of wood, and will be found useful in many ways such as hanging furs, clothing, etc., out to air. Do not make your bed on the ground. Build a box bedstead by driving four posts into the ground, then nail pieces across, up about twelve inches from the ground. Lay small poles on these cross pieces, then nail one or two small poles entirely around on the posts above the bottom pieces forming a sort of crib. This crib may be filled first with boughs, then on top of the boughs put a quantity of leaves or grass, when the mattress is lacking. There will also be store room under the bed, which would be wasted if the bed is made on the ground. Brother camper, when you are going well back into the tall timber where you are obliged to pack your outfit over a rough trail or perhaps no trail at all, do not waste any energy packing canned ""air"" in the shape of canned fruits. Take your grub in a crude state in the way of flour, beans, lard, bacon or pork, and if fruit is taken, take it in a dried form. Take the necessary supply of tea, coffee, sugar, salt and pepper, also that unavoidable baking powder. [Illustration: WOODCOCK FISHING ON PINE CREEK.] As to preparing an emergency camp for a night, if the weather is cold, and there is snow on the ground, the camper should pick a place where he will be as much sheltered from the cold winds as circumstances will allow and where he can get wood as conveniently as possible. Select a log (if one can be had) that lays close to the ground. Now, scrape away the snow about six or eight feet back from this log, and where you will have your bed, build a fire, on this space the first thing you do. Then build a cover over this space or fire, by first setting two crotched stakes about four feet apart and five or six feet high, back three feet from the log. Cut a pole, and place it in these crotches and then from this pole lay poles long enough to come back so as to give room for your bed, covering the space where the fire is built; one end of the poles resting on the ground. With evergreen boughs, cover this entire framework, top and two sides--toward the log open. Now scrape the fire down against the log and proceed to build your fire for the night. Cover the space where the fire was with fine boughs; this is your bed. Take off your coat, and spread it over your shoulders, rather than wear it on you as usual. When the camper has plenty of time, and a good axe, in building an open campfire the thing to do is to cut two logs six or eight inches in diameter and three feet long and place them at right angles with the back log, and three or four feet apart; then lay the wood across these logs. This will give a draft underneath the wood and cause the fire to burn much better than where the wood lays close to the ground. CHAPTER XX. Deer Hunt Turned Into a Bear Hunt. A friend by the name of Dingman invited me to come to his camp on More's Run, a tributary of the Sinnamahoning. This was something like forty years ago, when deer were plentiful and several men in this section made it a business to hunt for the money that there was in it, and Nathan Dingman was one of those men. It was about eight miles from my place to Mr. Dingman's camp. One morning after we had a fall of snow, I packed my knapsack with as much grub stake as I was able to carry, with my gun and blanket, and started over the hill to Mr. Dingman's camp. After I had crossed the divide, I did not go far before I began to see deer tracks. There was no road or trail down the run, and the run was pretty well filled with timber. I had about all that I could handle without deer tracks, but when I was within about a mile of Mr. Dingman's camp, I came onto the trail of several deer that had only been gone a few minutes. I could not stand it longer, so I hung my pack and blanket up in a tree and took my track back up the stream until I was quite sure that I was well out of range of the deer, and then climbed the ridge until I was near the top of the hill and on advantageous ground. The direction of the trail of the deer where it crossed the stream led me to think that the deer were going south, or down the ridge but on the contrary they had turned to the right and up the ridge. I had not gone far along the ridge before I began a sharp lookout. I suddenly found the deer lying in a thicket of low laurel. They broke from cover at a breakneck speed. I fired both barrels at them with the best aim that I was able to get, and had the satisfaction of seeing one of the deer, a good sized doe, stumble and partly fall, then hobble on in the direction that the other had gone. It was nearly sundown and I only followed the trail a short distance when I could plainly see that the deer had a foreleg broken, and she soon left the trail of the others, and went down the hill all alone. Knowing that the wounded deer would soon lay down if not disturbed. I left the trail, went back, got my pack, blanket and went on down the creek to Mr. Dingman's camp. I found Mr. Dingman about to sit down to a supper of roast potatoes, venison and other good things to be found in abundance in the woods in those days. The next morning we were out at daybreak after the wounded doe. Mr. Dingman said that when the doe was started up that she would come to water, and that she would stop on the creek below where I had left the trail, which led down the hill until in sight of the creek, when it turned to the right, then went back up the hill only a few yards to the right of her trail where she had gone down. When I saw what the doe had done, I thought to myself, old lady, you are well onto the game, and we will have lots of sport before we get you. I was well aware that she had seen me when I passed by on her trail where she had gone down the hill, and thinking that she would go to the creek below where Mr. Dingman was and told him the game the doe was playing. He said that she would come to water at the point just below the camp, and that he would go down there and watch, while I should follow the track through. I told Mr. Dingman that I was afraid that we were too late, and that the doe had already gone out, that she had made her bed so that she could watch her trail where she went down the hill, and had slipped out after I had gone down the hill on her trail. Mr. Dingman thought that he could get the runway before she would get through, even if she had gone out when I came through on her trail down the hill. In hopes that the deer had not taken the trail and lit out when I came through the hill, I worked my way cautiously back up the hill, only occasionally going in sight of the trail so as to keep her course, but as I feared, when I was about halfway up the hill, I found her bed, but the doe was gone. I took the trail and followed it up the hill until she struck the trail of the deer that she was with when I first started them, and instead of going down the ridge, she took the back trail of the other deer. I followed it back until near where I had wounded her, when she again broke down the hill and crossed the creek near where I first found their trail, and had gone back onto the same ridge that she had come from. Now the only thing for me to do was to leave the trail and go after Mr. Dingman again. When I found him and we got back to camp, it was about noon, so we got a warm dinner before continuing the chase. When we got up to where I had left the trail, we held council and made our plans for the next move, and decided that as the old lady was continually doing the unexpected, we would follow her track, one going on each side of the trail a few yards from it. We had only gone a short distance up the hill when we found the old lady's bed, where she had laid down, so that she could watch back on her trail, where she had come down on the opposite hillside. We did not go far when the trail turned to the left and went up the side of the ridge toward the head of the creek. We continued along the trail one on either side and soon we came to where a large hemlock tree had fallen parallel with the side of the hill. Mr. Dingman was on the upper side and above the fallen tree, while the deer tracks led away below the tree. All of a sudden I heard the report of Mr. Dingman's rifle, so I stood still for a minute, and hearing nothing more I went to see the cause of the shooting. The doe had gone beyond the fallen tree, then turned back and went about midway of the tree, on the upper side and lay down. Mr. Dingman caught a glimpse of the old lady as she went out, but did not catch her. We did not follow the doe far from where she lay behind the fallen tree, for we crossed the trail of a bear going west, and partly in the direction of that of the wounded deer, which continued to work her cards on us all afternoon without our getting sight of her. At dusk we trailed her into a small thicket at the edge of the farm owned by a man by the name of Foster, at the extreme head of the run. As it was too late in the day to do any more with the old doe, we concluded to go to Mr. Foster's and stay over night, and take the trail early in the morning. It was snowing a little and we thought that the thicket would be an easy place to find our game, should it snow enough to cover the tracks. In the morning when we got up, we found six or eight inches of snow on the ground, that had fallen during the night. We had an early breakfast, and started out to again play the game with the broken legged doe. Before we got to the edge of the woods, we struck the trail of some animal, that had gone across the field in the early part of the night before it had snowed much. We were not positive what sort of an animal it was, whether man or beast. The trail was leading straight across the field without a curve in it, and was making straight to a laurel patch that was one and a half miles away on the Taggart farm, less than a mile below Coudersport. Mr. Dingman said that it was a bear. I admitted that it was a bear all right, but replied that I would say it was making for the Adirondack Mountains in New York, rather than the laurel patch on the Taggert farm. We did not have far to go to make sure, and a good part of the distance was across farms, so we concluded to hunt bear a while, and give the old doe a rest for a short time. As Mr. Dingman said, the bear made straight for the laurel patch. There was not more than 15 or 20 acres in the patch, so we thought that we would circle it and make sure that the bear was still in the laurel. We found that the bear was there all right, so Mr. Dingman selected a place where he thought the bear would come out when he was routed from his nest, while I was to follow the trail and drive out the bear. I followed until near the center of the patch, when I came onto a small open place forty or fifty feet square. This open space was covered with a heavy growth of wild grass which partly held the snow from getting close to the ground, and I could see the trail of the bear through this grass and loose snow very plain until nearly the opposite side of the open space, and there I could see a bunch of snow. I was sure that it was the bear that made the bunch. I thought the matter over for a minute, then concluded to back out and go after Mr. Dingman, and see what he thought would be best in order to make a sure thing of Bruin's capture. Mr. Dingman thought the best thing to do was to go up town and get plenty of help so as to thoroughly surround the laurel, and make sure of Bruin. I objected, as I thought it best to try our own luck, and if we failed we could still get plenty of help. We followed my track back to where I had turned, and concluded to both fire at the bunch at the same time, hit or miss as luck would have it. When we fired at the bunch there was a shaking of snow, and bruin rolled out but was unable to rise to his feet. On examination we found that one ball had entered his shoulder. It was a short job to get bruin out to the road, and take him up to town where we sold him to Mr. Stebbins, a merchant, and then we made tracks back to see if we could find the broken legged doe. We found by circling the thicket that she was there, and we had the good luck to get her. We drove her out, and thus ended one of the liveliest day's sport that we ever had. CHAPTER XXI. Dog on the Trap Line. Now, we will say first that there is as much or more difference in the man who handles the dog as there is in the different breeds of dogs. I have heard men say that they wanted no dog on the trap line with them, and that they didn't believe that any one who did want a dog on the trap line knew but very little about trapping at best. Now those are the views and ideas of some trappers, while my experience has led me to see altogether different. One who is so constituted that they must give a dog the growl or perhaps a kick every time they come in reach, will undoubtedly find a dog of but little use on the trap line. I have known some dogs to refuse to eat, and would lay out where they could watch the direction in which their master had gone and piteously howl for hours. I have seen other dogs that would take for the barn or any other place to get out of the way of the first sight or sound of their master. This man's dog is usually more attached to a stranger than to his master. The man who cannot treat his dog as a friend and companion will have good cause to say that a dog is a nuisance on the trap line. I have seen men training dogs for bird hunting, who would beat the dog most cruelly and claim that a dog could not be trained to work a bird successfully under any other treatment. Though I have seen others train the same breed of dogs to work a bird to perfection and their most harsh treatment that they would use would be a tap or two with a little switch. I will say that one who cannot understand the wag of a dog's tail, the wistful gaze of the eyes, the quick lifting of the ears, the cautious raising of a foot, and above all, treat his dog as a friend, need not expect his dog to be but little else than a nuisance on the trap line. Several years ago I had a partner who had a dog--part stag hound and the other part just dog, I think. One day he, my partner, asked if I would object to his bringing the dog to camp, saying that his wife was going on a visit and he had no place to leave the dog. I told him that if he had a good dog I would be glad to have the dog in camp. In a day or two pard went home and brought in the dog. Well, when he came, the dog was following along behind his master with tail and ears drooping, and looking as though he had never heard a kind word in his life. I asked if the dog was any good and he replied that he did not know how good he was. I asked the name of the dog. He said, ""Oh, I call him Pont."" I spoke to the dog, calling him by name. The dog looked at me wistfully, wagging his tail. The look that dog gave me said as plain as words that that was the first kind word he had ever heard. We went inside and the dog started to follow, when his master in a harsh voice said ""get out of here."" I said, ""Where do you expect the dog to go?"" I then took an old coat that was in the camp, placed it in a corner and called gently to Pont, patted the coat and told Pont to lay down on the coat which the dog did. I patted the dog, saying, ""that is a good place for Pont,"" and I can see that wistful gaze that dog gave me now. After we had our supper I asked my partner if he wasn't going to fix Pont some supper. ""Oh, after awhile I will see if I can find something for him."" I took a biscuit from the table, spread some butter on it, called the dog to me, broke the biscuit in pieces and gave it to the dog from my hand, then I found an old basin that chanced to be about the camp and fixed the dog a good supper. After the dog had finished his supper I went to the coat in the corner, spoke gently to Pont, patted the coat and told Pont to lay down on the coat. That was the end of that, Pont knew his place and took it without further trouble. The next morning when we were about ready to start out on the trap line I asked pard what he intended to do with Pont. He said that he would tie him to a tree that stood against the shanty close to the door. We were going to take different lines of traps. I said, ""What is the harm of Pont going with me?"" ""All right, if you want him but I don't want any dog with me."" I said, ""Am (that was pard's given name, for short), I do not believe that dog wants to go with you any more than you want him."" Am's reply was that he guessed he would go all right if he wanted him. I said, ""Am, just for shucks, say nothing to the dog and see which one he will follow."" So we stepped outside the shack and the dog stood close to me. I said, ""Go on Am, and we will see who the dog will follow."" He started off and the dog only looked at him. Am stopped and told the dog to come on. The dog got around behind me. A said, ""If I wanted you to come you would come or I would break your neck."" I said, ""No, Am, you won't break Pont's neck when I am around, it would not look nice."" I started on my way, Pont following after I had gone a little ways. I spoke to Pont, patted him on the head and told him what a good dog he was. He jumped about and showed more ways than one how pleased he was. He showed plainly the disgust he had for his master. It so happened that the first trap that I came to was a trap set in a spring run, and it had a coon in it. I allowed Pont to help kill the coon, and after the coon was dead I patted Pont and told him what great things we had done in capturing the coon, and Pont showed what pride he took in the hunt, so much so that he did not like to have Am go near the pelt. I saw from the very first day out that all Pont needed was kind treatment and proper training to make a good help on the trap line. I was careful to let him know what I was doing when setting a trap, and when he would go to smell at the bait after a trap had been set, I would speak to him in a firm voice and let him know that I did not approve of what he was doing. When making blind sets, I took the same pains to show and give him to understand what I was doing. I would sometimes, after giving him fair warning, let him put his foot into a trap. I would scold him in a moderate manner and release him. Then all the time when I was resetting the trap I would talk trap to him, and by action and word, teach him the nature of the trap. Mr. Trapper, please do not persuade yourself to believe that the intelligent dog cannot understand if you go about it right. In two weeks Pont had advanced so far in his training that I no longer had to pay any attention to him on account of the traps and the third day that Pont was with me he found a coon that had escaped with a trap nearly two weeks before. My route called me up a little draw from the main stream, and I had not gone far up this when Pont took the trail of some animal and began working it up the side of a hill. I stood and watched him until the trail took him to an old log, when Pont began to snuff at a hole in the log, and he soon raised his head and gave a long howl, as much as to say ""he is here and I want help."" After running a stick in the hole I soon discovered that the log was hollow. I took my belt axe and pounded along on the log until I thought I was at the right point and then chopped a hole in the log. As good luck would have it, I made the opening right on the coon, and almost the first thing I saw on looking into the log was the trap. Pont soon had the coon out, and when I saw that it was the coon that had escaped with our trap, I gave Pont praise for what he had done, petting him and telling him of his good deed, and he seemed to understand it all. Not long after this Am came into camp at night and reported that a fox had broken the chain on a certain trap and gone off with the trap, saying that he would take Pont in the morning and see if he could find the fox. In the morning when we were ready to go Am tried to have Pont follow him but it was no go, Pont would not go with him. Then Am put a rope onto him and tried to lead him but Pont would sulk and would not be led. Then Am lost his temper and wanted to break Pont's neck again. I said that I did not like to have Pont abused and that I would go along with him. When we came to the place where the fox had escaped with the trap Am at once began to slap his hands and hiss Pont on. Pont only crouched behind me for protection. I persuaded Am to go on down the run and look at the traps down that way while Pont and I would look after the escaped fox. As soon as Am was gone I began to look about where the fox had been caught and search for his trail, and soon Pont began to wag his tail. I began to work Pont's way and said, ""has he gone that way?"" Pont gave me to understand that the fox had gone that way and that he knew what was wanted. The trail soon left the main hollow and took up a little draw. A little way up this we found where the fox had been fast in some bushes but had freed himself and he had left and gone up the hillside. Pont soon began to get uneasy, and when I said, ""hunt him out,"" away he went, and in a few minutes I heard Pont give a long howl and I knew that he had holed his game. When I came up to Pont he was working at a hole in some shell rocks. I pulled away some loose rocks and could see the fox, and we soon had him out and Pont seemed more pleased over the hunt than I was. There was scarcely a week that Pont did not help us out on the trap line. Not infrequently did Pont show me a coon den. I had some difficulty in teaching Pont to let the porcupines alone, but after a time he learned that they were not the kind of game that we wanted, and he paid no more attention to them. I have had many different dogs on the trap line with me. I can say that to any one who can understand ""dog's language,"" has a liking for a dog and has a reasonable amount of patience and is willing to use it, will find a well trained dog of much benefit on the trap line, and often a more genial companion than some partners. But if one is so constituted that he must give his dog a growl or a kick every time he comes in reach, and perhaps only give his dog half enough to eat and cannot treat a dog as his friend, then I say, leave the dog off the trap line. [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS OLD TRAPPING DOG PRINCE.] CHAPTER XXII. Two Cases of Buck Fever. I have heard many hunters say that they had never had a case of buck fever, and that they could shoot at a deer with as little emotion under all circumstances as they could at a target. Now this is not the case with me, for the conditions under which I am working makes all the difference imaginable with my nervous system. I never saw but one place that I did not get the buck fever when deer hunting and that was in Trinity and Humboldt counties, California. There I saw deer so thick and tame that it was no more exciting than it would be to go into a drove of sheep in a pasture and shoot sheep. If by chance you failed to hit the deer the first shot it was only a matter of a few minutes when you would have another opportunity to kill your deer. So there was no cause to get the fever, but such has not been the case in Eastern States, for many years at least. About 1880, a man by the name of Corwin and I were camping on the Jersey Shore turnpike in Pennsylvania. We had just gone into camp and as I usually make it a point to first get plenty of wood cut for the camp at night, so that when I come home in the evening I will not have to go out and cut wood, I had been cutting wood and fixing up all day until four o'clock in the afternoon, when I suggested to Mr. Corwin that we go out and see if we could find some signs and locate the deer so that we would know where to look for them early the next morning. We followed down a ridge for some distance without seeing any signs of deer but about the time that it was getting dark so that we could not see very good and we were about to go to camp, we came onto a trail of a number of deer. As it was so dark we left the trail and went to camp being careful not to start or alarm the deer. The next morning when we got up we found that a snow had fallen of some 8 or 10 inches and knowing that this snow would cover the trail of the deer so deep that there would be no following it until we could start them out of their beds, we concluded that one of us should go down the ridge opposite or west of the ridge where we had found the trail of the deer. It was decided that I should take the ridge opposite where the deer were thought to be, and Mr. Corwin was to warn me by firing two shots in rapid succession if he started the deer without getting a shot at them. I was familiar with the woods and knew about where the deer would run when started up from any particular point. I had gone down the ridge until I thought that I was below the point where the deer would have crossed had they done so during the night, or if Mr. Corwin should start them. I had neither heard anything from Mr. Corwin nor seen anything of the deer trail. I had given up hope of Mr. Corwin starting the deer so they would be likely to come my way. I had struck the trail of a single deer that was going down a short sawtooth point or a short spur of the main ridge. The track had been made during the night when it was still snowing and in some places it was hard to follow the trail owing to so much snow falling. The track led down this spur in the direction of low hemlocks. I was working my way very carefully thinking that the deer had gone down into those low hemlocks to get shelter from the storm and were lying down in the thicket. The thicket was just over a little cone or ridge so that I could not see the surface of the ground and I was dead sure that I would catch my game lying in his bed. In a moment a dozen deer came into sight as suddenly as though they had come up out of the ground and I was suddenly taken with one of the worst fevers that any man ever had. I at once began firing into the bunch. The deer seemingly did not notice the report of the gun but kept steadily on their trail. I knew the condition I was in and that I was shooting wide of the mark. I then singled out one of the largest deer, a good sized buck, and tried to pick out a spot on the back of his shoulders as though I was shooting at a target. I could not keep the gun within range of the deer by ten feet, so when I thought the gun had jumped into line, I pulled the trigger. The deer made no alteration in its course or speed but kept steadily bounding along. The deer were not more than forty yards from me. I dropped on one knee and leaned the gun across my knee, grabbed a handful of snow and jammed it into my face, then placed the gun to my face and began firing at the deer again with no better results. When the bunch of deer were nearly a hundred yards away and they had all passed over the brow of the hill, except one large doe that was a little behind the rest, the fever left me as suddenly as it came on. I pulled the gun onto her and fired. She staggered, gave a lunge down the hill and fell dead. I could have told within an inch of where the ball struck her before I went to the deer. I could not have told within fifty feet of where my other shots went. I followed my drove of deer a short distance to make sure that I had not wounded any of them and then I dragged the doe down into the hollow to dress and hang up. Pretty soon Mr. Corwin came to me and seeing only the one deer asked me if that was the only one I had killed with all that shooting. Mr. Corwin said that he had counted nine shots that I had fired. When I told him the story he had a hearty laugh of half an hour and said that I was lucky that I did not die in a fit. Now boys, you who have never had the buck fever can laugh at me all you like, but those who are over fond of the chase and get the buck fever will sympathize with me. Had I been expecting and looking for this drove of deer at the time instead of only one deer I should not have been attacked with this case of buck fever. Now, I will tell you of another case of buck fever from a cause entirely different from that just related. I was following the trail and there was just enough snow on the ground to make the best of still hunting. The wind was blowing just strong enough to make a noise in the tree tops overhead to drown any noise that the hunter might make by stepping on a dry limb, and every once in a while there would come a snow squall that would be so dense that you could see scarcely fifty feet. I had trailed the doe along the side of the hill for some distance. She was feeding alone and I was working along very carefully, keeping along the ridge several yards above the trail, to always be on advantage ground. I had not seen the trail of any other deer during the morning although it was in the height of the mating season, or as us common folks call it, the running season. I was trailing the doe along through a small basin where the timber was nearly all hardwood, beech and maple, and the woods were very open. I was quite positive that the doe was not far in advance for she had just been feeding on some moss from a limb that had blown down from a tree and the tracks were very fresh. About this time one of those snow squalls had come up. I was standing by a large maple tree waiting for the squall to pass by so that I could look the ground over well before I went any farther. After the squall had passed I looked the ground over closely but could see nothing of my deer. Forty or fifty yards farther along the side of the hill and below me there was a very large maple tree which had turned up by the roots. This tree hid from view a piece of ground close to the log. I could see that the trail led directly up to the tree. I could see a slight break in the snow on top of the log that I took to be made by the leg of the deer in jumping the log. I could see nothing of the trail beyond the tree so I worked very cautiously along until I could see past the root of the tree and as I suspected, there stood my game with head down, apparently asleep and standing broadside to me. I drew the gun onto a point just back of her shoulders and let go and the deer dropped almost in her tracks. I cut the deer's throat and began to skin out the foreparts. I had only partly gotten my work done when another one of those snow squalls came along. I was bending over the deer, busy at work when I heard a slight noise, and straightened up to see what had caused it. I looked none too soon to save myself from a terrible thrust from the horns of a large buck deer, for as I straightened up the deer shot past me like a shot from a gun, barely missing me and landed some six or eight feet beyond me. I had stood my gun against the log 8 or 10 feet from me. I sprang for my gun but I was trembling so that I could do nothing and I could scarcely stand on my feet. The buck stood for a moment looking back over his shoulders. Every hair on his back stood up like the hair on the back of an angry dog and I well remember the color of his eyes which were as green as grass. The deer stood and gazed at me for a moment then slowly walked off. The deer had gone some distance before I could control myself sufficiently to shoot. The buck had followed the trail of the doe up to the fallen tree and had caught me skinning her and it angered him. Instead of running off he was determined to attack me and the only thing that saved me from being severely hurt was my straightening up just at the right time to miss the thrust of the buck and the deer's missing me was what caused him to leave me. This was the worst case of buck fever that I have ever had and I do not care to ever experience a case of that kind again. CHAPTER XXIII. Partner a Necessity. As I promised to give some reasons why a partner is necessary, and as I have trapped many seasons both with and without a partner, I should know something about the subject. A writer, some time ago, in Hunter-Trader-Trapper said that it took some trappers fifty years to learn what others learned in a week. Now, I fully agree with this writer, for it only took me about three seconds to learn that a partner was necessary, and it came about in this way. I had several bear traps set near what is known as the Hogsback on the old Jersey Turnpike Road in Pennsylvania. The traps were strung along the ridge that divides the waters of the East Fork and the West Fork, which are tributaries of the west branch of the Susquehanna River and were setting from one and a half miles to four miles of the wagon road, and about nine miles from any house. The time in question was the last days of October or the first of November, and the day a very warm one for that time of the year. I had been walking very fast, in fact where the ground was favorable, I would take a dog trot. I wished to make the rounds of the traps and get out of the woods that day. When I came to where the second trap had been set, I found it gone, clog and all. The place where the trap was setting was in the head of a small ravine and near the edge of a windfall, just on the lower side of the bait pen, and but a few feet from it lay the partly decayed trunk of a large tree. I jumped on to this tree to get a good look down into the windfall to see if bruin was anywhere in sight. I had scarcely got on the log when I received a reception which I think was something equal to that the Russian Naval Fleet met with in the Corean Straits. I had jumped square into a colony of large black hornets, and they did punish me terribly in three minutes' time. My feet were swollen so that I was obliged to remove my shoes and my entire body was spotted as a leopard with great purple blotches and the internal fever which I had was most terrible. I thought that every breath that I drew was my last. I was two miles from the wagon road and nine or ten miles in the wilderness. No one knew where I was, nor where the traps were set. I thought no more of the bear. I only thought of reaching the wagon road. I began one of the worst battles of my life, but after a struggle of three hours I got to the road more dead than alive. But here fortune favored me for soon after a man by the name of White (one of the county commissioners who had been in the southern part of the county on business) came along. He took me home where the doctor soon got me on my feet again. I told my oldest brother where he would find the trap, so he took a man and team and went early the next morning and got the bear all right. It was four or five days before I felt able again to go into the woods and look at the traps, but when I did, I found a small bear, (a cub) dead and the skin nearly worthless. This was 45 years ago, but I am still working at the same old trade, in a small way. At another time and previous to the time mentioned, I, with a partner, was trapping on the headwaters of Pine Creek. We had been in camp about a week, when one day we had been setting a line of traps about three miles from camp. It was in November and the weather was very disagreeable, yet we were hustling for we knew that the snow would soon be on us, and then we wished to put in all the time we could hunting deer. On the day in question Orlando (that was my partner's name) long before noon was complaining of a bad headache, and said that it seemed as though every bone in his body ached. I tried to persuade him to go to camp but he insisted on setting more traps. About three o'clock in the afternoon he was obliged to give up, and said he would sit down where he was and wait until I could go further up the stream and set a couple more traps. I said no, we will go to camp, so we started. We were about three miles from camp, but Orlando could only go a few steps when he would be obliged to rest. He soon became so weak that I could only get him along by partly carrying him. He was several years younger than I, but he was somewhat heavier, so he was rather more of a load than I could well manage. I kept tugging away with him, and about 9 o'clock in the evening I got him to camp, where I fixed him as comfortable as I could, then I began a race of about eleven miles to Orlando's father's house. The distance was about one-half of the way through the woods and it took me until 12 o'clock to make it, but we soon had a team hitched to the wagon and were on the way back to the camp where we arrived about 3 o'clock in the morning. We could only get within about one and a fourth miles of the camp with a wagon, so we had to leave it there and go on with only the horses. When we got to the camp we found Orlando no better, so we got him on to one of the horses and by steadying him the best we could, managed to work our way back home. We arrived there about 8 o'clock in the morning and found a doctor already waiting. To make a long story short, it is sufficient to say that Pard had a long run of typhoid fever, and if he had been in the woods alone he would have surely died. I could relate other incidents where a pard did come in very acceptable. As it is a necessity to have a partner, it is also necessary to have a good one, for the successful trapper has no idler's job on his hands. You should always have a partner who is able to read and write and should have a pencil and paper in your pocket, for it often happens that you wish to leave a message at a certain place where Pard and you expect to meet on the trap line. Then each one takes a different line of traps, and circumstances has happened since you left camp in the morning that it changes the entire program. It also often happens that you get into camp at a different time than what you expected and wish to go out again and take up another line of traps, and you should try to keep one another informed as to about what section you are working in. Always endeavor to carry out the plans as near as possible the way they were planned before leaving camp in the morning. Of all things, do not accept of a man who is lazy or void of manly principles as a partner, for sooner or later you will drop him. Then it will make no difference how much you have done for him or how much you have befriended him in times past, he will do you all the dirt he is capable of doing. If you want to know all about a man, go camping with him. Probably you think you know him already, but if you have never camped on the trail with him, you do not. It may be that he is your near neighbor or he may have been a partner in business, but if you have not camped with him, you have yet to learn him. It is not a hard job to believe a man a good fellow when at home, but when you have camped with him on the trail, then you will know him. When your companion wishes to annoy any game, which you may find in your traps for the mere purpose of hearing the animal moan with pain; will shoot birds and animals just for the purpose of killing if you have a team with you, and your companion will ride up the steep hills where other men would walk; will neglect his beasts of burden in any way, this man you should never choose as your camping or trapping partner. But when you find one who will never wantonly torture a dumb animal and is kind to his beasts of burden, always giving it all the advantages and kind treatment possible, this man you needn't fear to accept as a trapping partner for in this man you will find ""a friend indeed when in need."" CHAPTER XXIV. A Few Words on Deadfalls. Comrades, as I have been asked to give my idea on the deadfall as a practical trap in taking the fur bearing animals, will say that I do not consider it a useless contrivance as some of the boys of the trap line claim. On the contrary, I consider it to be a very successful trap in taking many of the fur bearers such as will readily take bait including the skunk, mink, coon, opossum, rabbit, muskrat, etc. It is not to be supposed that the fox, coyote, wolf, etc., can be taken in the deadfall; neither is it supposed to be as convenient or as successful a trap as the steel trap. Yet, under favorable conditions I prefer it to the steel trap in trapping some animals, and it is certainly a little more humane in its operation as it usually kills its prey almost instantly, therefore it saves the animal much suffering. Now there are many kinds of deadfalls, the most of which have been shown from time to time in Hunter-Trader-Trapper. Were I up on drawing, I would illustrate some of the deadfalls which I consider the most successful, but I am not, so enclose photo. I will mention some of the deadfalls which I have seen in use in different parts of the country, some of which were good, but the majority I have seen in general use I did not like mostly on account of the length of time that it took to construct them, and the manner in which it was necessary to place the bait. I prefer a deadfall so constructed that several different kinds of bait can be used at the same time, therefore the trap is ready for more than one kind of an animal and also a trap that is readily constructed. In the South we see many deadfalls. The most common deadfalls used are those made by placing a bottom log about six or eight inches in diameter and five or six feet long. The drop was about the same size as the bottom log, only much longer and stakes were split from the pine logs and driven into the ground the entire length of the bottom log on both sides of the log. These stakes or boards were long enough to come above the drop log when the trap was set. The drop log was placed between the two rows of stakes and above the bottom log. The common figure 4 trigger was used and placed about midway of the bottom log and raising the drop log six or eight inches from the bottom log. This made a runway that enabled the animal to enter from either end of the run and the animal necessarily was on top of the bottom log and directly under the drop log. The bait was fastened to the spindle. This deadfall may work well on mink, skunk and opossum, but I hardly think it a good trap for other animals and it requires too much time to construct it. [Illustration: GOOD SMALL ANIMAL DEADFALL.] Another deadfall that I saw in common use on the Pacific Coast as well as in other sections of the country was the ordinary string deadfall. It is hardly necessary to describe this trap for every boy who works a trap line knows how to make them. The trap is made by using a bottom log three or four feet long and a drop log of the same size, but much longer. If the trap is not heavy enough of its own weight, place logs on the drop log until it is sufficiently heavy to kill the animal. Four stakes are driven, two on either side of the log and close to the bottom log and about two feet apart and driven so that the top or drop log will work easily between the stakes. Two of the stakes, the ones driven on the side where the bait pen is, had a crotch or fork and a stick was placed in these crotches. A string was tied to the drop log and to a stick of the proper length so that when the drop log was raised up eight or ten inches from the bottom log and the string passed over the stick in the crotches, one end of the trigger stick would rest against the stick placed in the crotches. The other end would slightly catch onto another stick, laid directly under the one that rests in the crotches and resting against the forked stakes and about two inches from the bottom log. This stick is called the treadle, as the animal going into the bait pen to get the bait must step on this treadle, pushing it down, which will release the trigger spindle and allow the drop log to fall. The bait pen is usually made by driving stakes in a circle from one of the trap stakes to the other stake on the same side of the bottom log. This style of a deadfall is alright as to handling bait, but I do not consider it a sure trap, as often the animal will set off the trap before it is far enough under the drop to make a sure catch. I prefer a trigger that will cause the animal to get at least one fore leg over the bottom piece before the trap is sprung. In making this style of a deadfall it is not necessary to use a string and the forked stakes with the cross stick in the forks; all that is necessary is to have two upright standards, one locked on to the other by just a notch cut in the standard that the drop rest on and catch the other end of the standard resting on the bed place. This standard is made slightly wedge shape so as to rest firmly in the notch in the upper standard. The notch should be about two-thirds the distance from the lower end of the stick up and just long enough to come down and rest against the side of the crossbar or treadle, which, as before stated, should be about two inches above the bed piece. The stone deadfall with the figure 4 trigger, I have found in common use in nearly all sections where large flat rocks were to be had to use in making the trap. This stone deadfall is alright in mink trapping and smaller animals but it is not favored much in coon trapping. There are many other styles of deadfalls which I will try to describe later. As to animals taking bait, will say, I have never had much trouble in getting meat or carnivorous animals to take bait, but sometimes it is necessary to use a different bait than what they will take at other times. This, undoubtedly, is owing to what the animals have been accustomed to feeding on. If the animal is fed on a certain kind of food and will no longer take readily to it as a bait, then use something different. For instance, I found it difficult on the Pacific Coast in the vicinity of Vancouver to get mink to take flesh as a bait, while they readily took other baits. When the mink will not take bait readily, then of course the deadfall does not make a successful mink trap. While the deadfall cannot take the place of the steel trap, yet a well constructed deadfall under some conditions has advantages over the steel trap. Often a deadfall can be set in a thicket of evergreen trees or under a single pine, hemlock or other evergreen tree, or it may be protected by building a frame of poles above the trap and cover with boughs to partly protect the trap from the heavy snows. Now you have a trap that will work alright, where a steel trap would freeze down from sleet or other causes and would not spring; nor will Johnny Graball carry off a deadfall. No, boys, do not shun the deadfall when trapping skunk in a section where material is convenient to build it with, and especially if you are near your trapping grounds so that you can go out at times and put up a trap or two so as to have a good line of deadfalls ready when the trapping season arrives. CHAPTER XXV. Advice from a Veteran. In trapping, cultivate the habit of taking great care in making sets. Always leave the surface level. As you cannot tell what particular animal may come your way, prepare for the most cunning. Note the surroundings of your set and use such material for covering as may be found there so that all may appear natural. Never stake the traps down for a dry land set, but select for a drag an old limb or root; not one fresh cut if avoidable. Obliterate your tracks; John Sneakem will not then catch on so quick. Above all things, never molest another's traps. The jump-trap as now made by the Oneida Community has thicker jaws than the old style and therefore it is not so liable to foot the animal. I find it a good trap to use. For mink, a good set is close to a bank and near the edge of the water. The bait if any is used, should be fresh muskrat, rabbit or chicken. All are good. If you wish for scent, the musk from the animal you are trapping is preferable. One famous trapper says, ""any fool knows enough to catch a muskrat."" I doubt whether this man himself, knows how to trap them successfully. Of course, everyone knows that muskrats should be trapped along streams or swails where you find their works. For bait use carrots, cabbage or sweet apples. I like sweet apples best, and so do the muskrats. Set the trap in about two inches of water, fasten the chain at full length to a sunken limb, drive a stake on either side of the chain near where it is fastened and you need not fear that the rat will ""foot"" himself. He will soon become entangled and drown. Another good set for rats is by scooping a piece out of a sod and placing it on a stone or root just under the water. Set trap on sod, fasten the chain as before and scatter bits of apple on the sod. * * * Now, boys, as many of you are about to seek new trapping locations, and as I have had more or less experience in trapping from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and as I get many letters from brother trappers as to different trapping locations, I thought perhaps that it would not come amiss to give you a little of my experience in regard to this matter. I would advise that before you go to a new location in other states from those in which you are familiar with the game laws, that you first write to the State Game Commissioner of the state that you intend to trap in, enclosing 10 or 15 cents in stamps, and ask for a copy of the game laws, or for the information that you desire. The address of the Game Commissioner is usually at the capital of the different states. Advice on game laws is generally so meager that it is often misleading, and one relying on newspaper information, often runs up against problems that he would not have undertaken had he known the exact truth of the matter. The game laws of the different states are changed so often that the only way to get reliable information is to go direct to headquarters. Now, some states have local laws, county laws, and some states have even township laws. I will also speak of writing to trappers for information as to the quantity of the fur bearing animals and game in their locality as another way to get posted. Now, while I hope that the average trapper is as truthful as mankind generally, I am aware that a trapper will sometimes exaggerate as to the amount of game in his locality. If the person whom you make the inquiry of, is not particularly interested in trapping, or knows but little about trapping and wild life, he is liable to think there is much more game in his county than there really is. And on the other hand, if the party makes a business of trapping, he is quite liable to think that game is less plentiful than it really is. It is a good plan to write to two or more parties in the same neighborhood, on this matter, if you can, and then draw your own conclusion as to the scarcity or plentifulness of the game in that section. But the better way is to go and prospect the country and acquaint yourself with the locality, for you remember the old adage, ""If you would have your business done, go and attend to it yourself; if not, send some one."" * * * I have read with interest the discussion of the many different makes of guns, the different calibers for large game hunting, etc., and as I am not well up on ""gunology,"" I have listened and wondered why there was so much agitation on the gun question. I believe that nearly all of the modern guns that are manufactured today are good--at least sufficiently good shooters for all practical purposes. Shotguns can be bought at $3.00 or $4.00 that do good work. Perhaps there is not a man in the country who has carried a gun as many days as the writer, but what has done more target shooting than I have. Back in the 70's when men hunted deer in this section for the money that was in it, I often did not take my rifle down to shoot from one season's hunting to the next, unless by chance something in the way of game came into fields near the house. I was always in love with my gun and if I did not like it I would get rid of it at the first opportunity. I am still of the opinion that a gun is similar to a man's wife, you must love them in order to get the best results. I always wanted as good a gun as there was on the market. By this I do not mean the highest priced, nor the highest power gun, but the gun that would do the business. A man by the name of Orlando Reese and I were the first to buy Winchester rifles in this section, and I think in this county. The guns were the common round barrel .44 caliber and we paid $60.00 apiece for them. The same kind of a gun can now, I think, be bought for $12.00 or $14.00. Previous to the time I bought the Winchester, I had been using a Henry rifle for a time, but it was not a good gun for hunting purposes. A few years later the .45-75 Winchester came into use, so I sold my .44 and bought a .45-75. I did not like it so I sold it and bought a Colts, which was a good gun, but one day I was doing some fast work on a bunch of deer and in my haste I did not work the lever just as I should and it jammed. This made me rather angry, so I sold it and got another .44 Winchester, which I used for a long time, but I disposed of it very unexpectedly. I was coming out from camp after a new stock of provisions. My partner, Amersley Ball, was with me. We had not gone far after getting in the wagon road when we met a man by the name of Lyman who was on his way to the Cross Fork of Kettle Creek, for the purpose of inspecting the timber lands and wanted a gun to carry with him. Before Mr. Lyman was hardly in speaking distance he yelled at me and asked what I would take for my gun. Thinking that he was only joking I said $40.00. Mr. Lyman came up to me, took my gun from my shoulders, looked at it and asked me if it was alright. I replied that if it was not I would not be carrying it. Mr. Lyman replied, ""I guess that is right,"" and taking a check from his pocket dropped down on one knee, filled it out for forty dollars and handed it to me, so I was without a gun right in the midst of the hunting season. My protest was of no use, as Mr. Lyman took the gun and went his way, laughing at me. I received a little more for the gun than the usual price at the time, but there was no dealer at our place who kept the Winchester in stock. The dealers were always obliging and would take your order and get you a gun for a small profit of about sixteen dollars. I had no time to wait for a gun to be ordered, so I began to look about to find some one who had a gun for sale. Mr. Wm. Thompson, the publisher of a local newspaper in our place had bought a new .38 caliber Winchester to use in his annual outing and said that he would have no further use for a gun until another season that if I would give him $35.00, I could have his gun. I gave Mr. Thompson the money and the next morning we went back to camp. After we had arrived at camp, I crossed the divide from the Sinnemahoning side of the Pine Creek side to hunt. I had not gone far after reaching Pine Creek before I struck the trail of five or six deer. After following the trail a ways I concluded that the deer would pass around the point of the ridge and pass through a hardwood balsam on the other side of the ridge. I climbed the hill and made for the balsam in hope to head the deer off. I had only reached the brow of the hill so that I could look into the basin when I saw the deer. I thought to myself, there is a good chance to try my new gun, for I had not yet shot it. I drew on a large doe that was in the lead of the bunch and cut loose. The doe made a leap into the air, made a jump or two down the hill and went down, while the rest of the deer made two or three jumps up the hill towards me and stopped and looked back down the hill in the direction of the doe that I had shot. I pulled onto the shoulders of a buck, the largest deer of the bunch, who gave his tail a switch or two, wheeled, made a few jumps down the hill and fell, while the rest of the bunch made a lively break for other parts. I continued to scatter lead as long as I could see them. I ran down to the deer that I had killed, cut their throats, removed their entrails, climbed some saplings, bent them down, cut off the tops and hung the deer on them. Getting a pole with a crotch at the end to place under the sapling, I pulled the deer up the best that I could and started on the trail of the others. I did not follow the trail long when I saw one of them had a broken leg. The deer with the broken leg soon dropped out from the others and went down the hill, crossed the hollow and went into a thick hemlock timber and laurel. As it was nearly night, I left the trail and went home to camp. The next morning, Mr. Ball went with me to help get the wounded deer. We did not follow the trail far until we saw the deer fixing to lie down. I backed up and went up the hill above where we thought the deer might be lying. While Mr. Ball waited for me to give the signal to come. Mr. Ball had not gone far after I had howled, letting him know that I was ready, when out of the laurel came the deer. Mr. Ball was close, so that we both got a shot, killing the deer almost before it was on its feet. Now I was so infatuated with my new gun, that it was a case of love at first sight. This was in the late 70's. I have used several different makes of guns. I also had a .30-30 Savage, which I considered a good gun for big game, and in fact, I can say that the most of the guns that I have tried were all good. I however am still married to my little .38 Winchester. I can say that in all these, considerable more than thirty years, I have never run up against a subject but that this little Winchester was equal to the emergency. Now I wish to ask, why it is that a hunter cares for a high power gun that will shoot into the next township and kill a man or a horse that the hunter was not aware of existing, when a gun of less power will do just as good execution in deer hunting? The ammunition for the gun of lower power costs much less and there is far less danger in killing a man or beast a mile away. We hear men talk of shooting deer 200 and even 300 yards. In the many years that I have hunted deer, I believe that I have killed two deer at a distance of from 50 to 75 yards, to one a distance of 100 or 150. I believe most deer hunters will agree that there are far more deer killed at a distance of 50 or 60 yards than over that distance. I think that if those hunters who kill deer at a distance of 100 or 200 yards will take the trouble to step off the distance of their long shots, instead of estimating them, they will find that 100 yards in timber is a long ways. Yes, boys, 20 rods through the timber is a long ways to shoot a deer. Why? Because the deer can not often be seen at a greater distance, where there would be any use of shooting at all, and the little .38 will do all of that and more too. * * * Perhaps the average beginner at trapping makes his greatest mistake in listening to those who have had more experience in handling the pen than the trap. For instance, someone advised readers to use a No. 2 or 3 Newhouse trap to catch marten and said that marten frequented marshy places. Now if they had asked the editor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper, he would have told you that the Pine Marten frequented the higher and dry grounds in dark, thick woods and that it was their nature to run on old down trees and to run into hollow stubs, trees, etc., and that these were the places to set your traps. Unless you were in a country where the snow fell very deep, then you should use the shelf set. He would have also told you that the No. 1 and 1 1/2 Newhouse trap was plenty strong enough for the marten, that many use No. 0. [Illustration: SPRING SET FOR FOX.] The average trapper also makes a mistake in listening to some one's ideas about scents in trapping the animal, instead of going to the forest, the field and the stream and there learn its nature, its habits and ways, and its favorite food. He also makes a mistake by spending his time in looking after scents, rubber gloves to handle traps with and wooden pincers to handle bait, instead of spending his time in learning the right way and the right place to set his traps. For one little slip and the game is gone if the trap is not properly set. It is like hunting in the days of the percussion cap gun. I have tramped all day long over hills and through valleys to get a shot at a deer, and just at night get the coveted opportunity, taking every precaution to see that there was no bush or obstruction in line. I would take deliberate aim, holding my breath that my aim might be sure. I trick the trigger, flick went the hammer, up goes the deer's tail and away he bounds beckoning me to come on. Come on, and my day's tramp has been in vain all on account of a damp gun cap. Now in these days of fixed ammunition, such mishaps rarely occur. It is so in setting the trap, one little misfit and the game is gone. In the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, I read, undoubtedly written by a trapper of many years experience, telling the true way of setting the trap in front of a V shaped pen. He said that the trap should always be set so that the animal had to pass over the jaws of the trap and not between them. Now mark my mistakes, for of late years I have been very particular to set the traps so that the animal passed between the jaws, not over them for I reasoned like this: I thought that the animal might step on one of the jaws and turn the trap up without springing it. In so doing be frightened away, or that the animal might have ball of foot resting on the jaw of the trap, while it set the trap off with its toes, or the ball of the foot might rest on the latch, while the trap was sprung with the toes on the pan. In either case, the animal's foot would be thrown entirely from the trap or so that it would only get slightly pinched, which would put a flea into the animal's ear that he would never forget. In days long since past, I was not particular how I set the trap, just so I got it planted, but in those days I also made the mistake of running after scents. We make a mistake in thinking that the fox is more sly in some states than in others. Not long ago, I received a letter from a friend in Maine, asking if I did not think that the fox was harder to trap in some states than others. Now the states that I have trapped in are rather limited, but I have trapped in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, mostly in Pennsylvania. I have also trapped in one or two other states, and wherever I found the fox, I found him the same sly fox. In order to trap this animal successfully it was necessary to comply with the natural conditions. We make mistakes in not handling our fur properly; in not removing all fat and flesh from the skin in not stretching the skin on the proper shaped stretchers. Stretchers for most fur that we case should not taper more than 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch from shoulder to hind legs. We make mistakes in setting our traps too early, for one prime skin is worth more than three early caught ones. We make mistakes in not having one, and only one, responsible and honorable party in each large city to ship our furs to; by giving one party a large trade should give the trapper the full market price for his furs. It would also have a tendency to make the buyer honest and honorable, even though he was not built strictly that way in making. All trappers should know the address of the party agreed upon in each city. This would give the trapper a chance to ship to the party most convenient to the trapper. The worst mistake of all mistakes is in one who uses poison to kill with. Let me tell of an instance that came under my observation the spring of 1900, I believe it was. I had an occasion to go into the southern part of this country, my road lay over the divide between the waters of the Alleghany and Susquehanna, about five miles of the road lay over a mountain that was thickly wooded and no settlers. While crossing this mountain I saw the carcasses of four foxes lying in the road. On making inquiries I learned that a man living in that neighborhood was making a practice each winter of driving over the roads in that section and putting out poisoned meat to kill the foxes. I chanced to meet this man not long ago. I said, ""Charley, what luck did you have trapping last winter."" His reply was, not much only got one or two foxes. Old Shaw has dogged them out of the country (referring to a man who hunted with dogs). I said, ""Charley, don't you think that poison business had something to do with it. He replied, ""Oh, h--l there will be foxes after I am dead."" This man called himself a trapper, and is quite an extensive fur buyer. Thomas Pope says, ""Man's inhumanity to man, makes countless thousands mourn."" But, in this case, I think it is the dumb animal that mourns and not the man. The trapper who makes the greatest mistake of his life is the one who does not subscribe for the Hunter-Trader-Trapper. * * * In a former article I undertook to give the most practical way of killing a skunk, as I have found it, but owing to a mistake, it left the method of killing rather hard to be understood, so I will try again. I do this, owing to the many requests that I have from trappers to give a method for killing skunks, without the skunk scenting themselves as well as the trapper. Practically, there is no way of killing a skunk without causing the skunk to discharge his scent. Their scent is a skunk defense, and they will use it when in danger. Now my way of doing the job is to go at it without hesitation. We have an old adage, ""If you would grasp a nettle, grasp it as a man of mettle."" Now my plan is to wear clothes on the trap line to be discarded as soon as the day's work on the trap line is finished. When I come to a trap that has a skunk in it, I approach the skunk, advancing a single step at a time, with a good strong stick about four feet long, with the stick drawn up in readiness to strike as soon as close enough. Now when I am close enough to make the blow sure I strike the skunk a hard blow across the back, and immediately after, I place my foot on the skunk's back, holding the animal tight to the ground. At the same time giving the skunk a sharp rap or two on the head with the stick to make sure that it is dead. Then pick up the skunk and remove it a little to one side of the place where it was killed. Rip the skunk across from one leg to the other close to roots of tail, skinning around the scent glands at the roots of tail, so that the glands can be easily cut out and thrown away or saved for bait, as the trapper wishes. Now proceed to skin the skunk. By following these directions, the trapper will not suffer any great inconvenience from the animal's scent. Now if the trapper is a little timid, he can carry some kind of a gun of small caliber and shoot the skunk in the head. But if the skunk does not use his weapon of defense, then it is a different skunk than I have been accustomed to meet with. If the trapper uses a clog instead of a stake to fasten his trap with, and his traps are close to water, he can use a long pole or a hook and gently drag the skunk to the water and drown it. Then the water will carry the fluid or scent as discharged, away. Now if the trapper is very timid and has plenty of time, I would advise that he provide himself with a light pole ten or twelve feet long, split at one end and take a quart tin can with sockets or brackets soldered onto the sides of the can, so that the can may be placed in between the split at the end of the pole. The two prongs placed into the sockets on the can so as to hold the can firm. Now fill the can part full of cotton and prepare yourself with a bottle of chloroform (not brandy). Now with this outfit the trapper will proceed to follow along his trap line, and when he finds a skunk in his trap he will cautiously approach the skunk after he, the trapper (not the skunk) has well saturated the cotton in the can from the chloroform from the bottle. Then gently work the can up to the skunk's nose and over its head, when the chloroform will soon do its deadly work. After the skunk is dead, the trapper should remove the scent glands as before described, lest the scent may be squeezed from the glands in skinning the skunk. Another reader asks what kind of a gun he shall take with him to hunt deer, as he is contemplating going on a deer hunting trip next fall. Now I would say any kind of a rifle that suits you. But if you should ask me what kind of a gun I use, I would not hesitate to say that I prefer the 38-40 and black powder. This gun shoots plenty strong to do all the shooting as to distance or penetrations that the deer hunter will require, and there is not near so much danger of shooting a man or domestic animal a mile away that the hunter knows nothing of, as is the case with a high power gun. Besides, from an economical point, the ammunition for the 38-40 black powder gun costs only about one-half that of the smokeless or high power guns. However, if the hunter thinks that he must have a high power gun in order to be a successful deer hunter, he will find the 30-30 or similar calibers good for large game, and it is not heavy to handle. CHAPTER XXVI. The Screech of the Panther. Some time ago, a writer to the H-T-T, whose name I have forgotten, gave his views in regard to this subject, and requested that the readers give their experiences and ideas on the matter. A year or so ago, I wrote to a sporting magazine (now defunct) giving my views on this horrible screech of the panther. I have camped in the wilds of California, Oregon, Idaho and Washington. Sixty years ago, in my childhood days, it was an everyday occurrence to hear some one tell of having a panther follow them through a certain piece of woods, and tell of the horrible screams that the panther gave while following them. And still to this day, there is, occasionally a person who reports of hearing that terrible screech of the panther here in old Potter, notwithstanding that there has not been a panther killed in the county for upwards of fifty years, though twice within fifty years, I have been frightened nearly out of my boots by that terrible screech. On one occasion I was watching a salt lick for deer; I was on a scaffold built up in a tree thirty or forty feet from the ground. The lick was in a dense hemlock forest. It was well along into the night--I was listening with all my energy, expecting to hear the tread of a deer, but, so far I had heard nothing but the rustle of the porcupine and the hop of the deer-mouse and the jump of the rabbit on the dry leaves. Still, I was listening intently for that tread of a deer which sounds different from that of any other animal, when, with the suddenness of a flash of lightning that terrible screech of the panther came within six feet of my head. Was I frightened? I guess yes. And had not my gun been tied to a limb of the tree to keep it in place it would have gone tumbling down the tree to the ground. Glancing up in the direction from whence that terrible scream came, I could plainly see the outline of a screech owl. On another occasion I had started about midnight from home to go to my hunting camp. About five miles of the distance was along a road with heavy timber on each side. The night was warm for the time of the year, with a slight mist of rain. I was hustling along the best I could to reach camp by the time it was daylight. I had my rifle and a pack-sack with a grub stake to last for a week, on my back. When again, with great suddenness that terrible screech of the panther sounded in the trees over my head. The screech was so sudden and so sharp that I came near dropping right through to China. After recovering my breath and gazing into the timber for a moment, I again discovered one of those frightful owls. Every close observer, who has put in a great deal of time in the woods in the night, away from a fire and noise, knows that an owl will alight within a few feet of them, and they will not be aware of the presence of the owl when it approaches them. This noiseless movement of the owl is said to be from the large amount of down that grows on the wings of the bird. As I stated, I have camped in several states west of the Rockies, and have from childhood until late years almost continually been in the woods, and the only screech of the panther I ever heard came from the owl. My father moved from Washington County, York State, into this county about a hundred years ago, when northern Pennsylvania was an unbroken wilderness, and the few settlers who lived in these parts were compelled to go sixty miles to Jersey Shore to mill. This trip was made down Pine Creek, and usually with an ox team, and those who made the trip were obliged to camp out every night while making the trip for there were no settlers living along the whole route. The road was merely a trail cut through the woods. Father often made this trip down Pine Creek to Jersey Shore, camping out each night. I have often heard him say that he never head any kind of a noise that he thought came from a panther--and panthers were plentiful in this section in those days. Father laughed at the idea of the panther screaming, when he heard people telling of hearing them. However, regardless of what my father and other early settlers of this section, who were not possessed of strong imaginary minds have told me, as well as my own experience, I have evidence that the panther does scream and scream terribly, too. A neighbor of mine, by the name of Mr. Mike Green, a man about fifty years old, after reading the article which I mentioned at the beginning, came to me and said that I was away off in regard to the panther not screaming. He told of two occasions where he had had adventures with panthers and they screamed fearfully. One of Mr. Green's adventures happened in Clearfield County, this state, the other in West Virginia. Mr. Green stated that he was driving a team, hauling supplies for a lumber camp, when on two occasions he was out on the road until late at night with his load of supplies some of which consisted of several quarters of fresh beef. He heard the panther scream out in the woods and narrowly escaped the panther by whipping the team and driving rapidly into camp, the panther following him, screaming at every jump. A few nights later the panther again attacked Mr. Green near camp. He heard it scream and again made haste to reach the camp. When near camp the panther made several attempts to leap onto the wagon, but owing to Mr. Green's rapid driving the panther failed to reach the load. Later, Mr. Green was lumbering in West Virginia. The teamster who was hauling camp supplies the same as Mr. Green had in Clearfield County, was killed by a panther. Mr. Green heard the panther scream and when the teamster did not come, he with others from the camp went in search of the man, and found him dead. The men in camp made up a purse to pay the burial expenses, Mr. Green contributing to the fund. I have often been going along the road at dusk through the woods and had an owl follow along for some distance, flying from tree to tree, alighting on trees near me, and would often give one of those screeches, which no doubt has often been mistaken for the scream of a panther, when this trick of the owl occurred when too dark to be seen. * * * The screech of the panther I believe to be all imagination. Years ago it was an everyday occurrence to hear some one tell of a panther screaming in a certain locality and tell how it (the panther) had followed them and how they escaped by running their horses, and how the panther screamed in a tree right over their head, and how they could see the panther's eyes shine. Now I know that one cannot see an animal's eyes shine unless the animal is in the dark and a light shines directly in their eyes. It is not always these stories are told to misrepresent facts, but it is often the case of imagination or being mistaken. One of the large owls has another cry or call besides the well known hoo-hoo-hoo, which the deer still-hunter often imitates when he wishes to inform a companion just where he is without fear of alarming the deer. The writer has often seen, just at twilight, or nearly break of day, one of those large owls follow along some distance in the woods, flying from tree to tree, lighting on the lower branches of the trees, only a few feet above my head, apparently doing this from curiosity. Frequently the owl would give a screech which was similar to that given by a woman who has been suddenly frightened. Undoubtedly this screech of the owl has often been taken for that of the panther. Owing to the great abundance of down or fine feathers on the quills of the wings of the owl, the owl can light within six feet of a person's head, and if the owl was not seen, you would not know of its presence, for you could not hear the flight of the owl. While I have not had as much experience in the haunts of the panther as some, yet I have been all through the Pacific Coast States and a good part of the mountains, and have never heard what I thought was the cry of a panther, or a mountain lion. My father often told me that he had never heard anything that he called a screech of panther and did not think that a panther ever made any such screeching noise as is claimed, yet in my younger days it was a frequent occurrence to hear some one tell of hearing a panther and how a panther had followed them through a certain piece of woods. Even to this day we occasionally hear of some one being followed by a panther and how they had heard a panther screeching on a certain hill. CHAPTER XXVII. Handling Raw Furs and Other Notes. Boys, as you are nearly all in from the trap line and the trail, (May, 1910), I am going to take the opportunity to give the younger trappers (and some of the older ones, too) a drubbing. I would like to see every trapper get all that his furs are worth and I would not like to see one-half the value of your furs go, simply because you neglected to skin and stretch your catch as it should be. During the past winter I was in town one day and met a fur buyer and he asked me to go over and see his bunch of furs, saying, ""I am going to ship the furs tomorrow."" I went with the fur dealer and found that he had a lot of stuff, several hundred dollars worth of furs, consisting of fox, coon, skunk, mink, and muskrat, some wildcat. A good part of this bunch of furs had been caught at least a month before it should have been. Of this unprime fur I will have but little to say. I am sorry to know that any trapper will throw away his time and money by trapping furs before the fur is in reasonably prime condition. This dealer had many coon and skunk that had from one-half to a pound of grease left on the skin. I asked the dealer if he was going to ship those pelts with all that grease on. His reply was, that he was going to ship the furs just as they were and added that he did not pay anything for that fat, and only half what the skins were worth if they had been handled right. I suggested that he would have to pay express charges on that grease. The dealer said that he could not help that, signifying that he had made that up in buying the furs. I called the dealer's attention to a very good black skunk skin, that had been badly skinned and stretched and asked what he paid for such a pelt. He said that he did not remember, but he knew that he did not pay $3 for a hide that looked like that. Now this skunk skin was spoiled so far as the looks went, if not in real value, and it at least gave the dealer a good excuse to put that pelt in the third or fourth grade. The trapper, in skinning this skunk, had ripped down on the inside of the forelegs and across the belly three or four inches up from the tail. The proper way being to begin at the heel, ripping straight down the leg and close to the under side of the tail. Then carefully cut around the roots of the tail and work the skin loose from the tail bone until the bone can be taken between the fingers on one hand and with the other hand draw the tail bone clear from the tail. In this pelt the tail bone had been cut off close to the body and left in the tail. In stretching this skin the trapper had made a wedge-shaped board. The board was at least four inches wider at the broad end than it should have been and then sharpened off to a point. I think it best to make the stretching board in width and length in proportion to the animal, slightly tapering the board up to where the neck of the animal joined to the shoulders, then taper and round up the board to fit the neck and head of the animal. The tapering from the shoulders to the point of the nose of course would necessarily be longer on a board for a fox or mink than that of a muskrat or coon, which would need to be more rounding. There are some good printed patterns for stretching boards for sale. I have noticed that some trappers have holes in the broad end of their stretching boards and hang up their furs while drying with the head of the animal hanging down. Now I think that is a wrong idea. It is not a natural way for the fur on the animal to lay, pitching towards the head of the animal, and especially if there is any grease, blood, or other matter that would dry, causing the fur to stick out like the quills on a fretful porcupine. Now, boys, let us get into the habit of getting more money out of our catch of furs by removing the greater part of the fat from the skins; also by taking a little more time to skin and stretch the furs that we catch; also by doing less early and late trapping, when the fur is not in a fairly prime condition. I am pleased to see so many of the trappers in Pennsylvania advocating a closed season on the furbearers of this state, though I think that they seem to be in favor of a longer open season than will be to the trapper's advantage. * * * Comrades of the trap line, are you awake to the conditions under which we must work? The dog man has no use for the trapper and his traps. Now comrades, while I am a lover of the dog, and have used him on the trap line and trail, I have, nevertheless used the dog for a different purpose than it is ordinarily used by the average sportsman. I hope the trappers throughout the country will arouse themselves to the conditions and not allow the legislation of their respective states to pass laws to put the trapper in the hole, at the pleasure of the dog man, as has been done here in Pennsylvania. (This was written Spring of 1912.) I believe that the dog man and the trapper, are each entitled to equal privileges--the dog has no better friend than the writer. Though we do not blame our brother trapper, who will not put up as good a scrap in defense of his traps and his sport and occupation, as does the dog man in defense of his dog, and his way of enjoying an outdoor life. But comrades, we are all men and sportsmen in our way, and let us be reasonable in this matter; but brother trappers, let us not take a back seat because we may not be possessed with as large an amount of worldly goods as some of the dog men may be. Express your views upon this matter of the trappers' rights through the columns of Hunter-Trader-Trapper. Also with our respective representatives that they may not pass game laws that the trapper is compelled to ignore, as is the case here in Pennsylvania. Here they ask for a bounty on noxious animals, yet, the law forbids the setting of a trap in a manner that would take anything more wary or greater than the weasel. Was this law enacted wholly for the benefit and pleasure of the dog man? Now I wish to speak of another matter that I think is greatly to the interest of the trapper, and that is, early and late trapping. No, no, I do not mean morning and evening--I refer to trapping early and late in the season. And while I do not approve of putting out traps too early in the season, it is far better that we begin trapping in October, than it is to continue trapping until into March, for such animals as mink, fox and skunk begin to fade, or become rubbed, while the mink that is caught in October, has nearly its full amount of fur. Still, the flesh side of the skin is a little dark, which gives the dealer a chance to quote the skins as unprime, notwithstanding the pelt has its full value as to fur purpose. And as to furs caught in March, the dealer has a chance to quote ""springy."" And brother trappers of the States, do not put off your shipments of furs until late in March. It has been my experience where furs are shipped late in the spring, the returns are marked ""springy,"" ""rubbed,"" etc., notwithstanding the skins, or at least part of them, may have been caught in December or January. Comrades, let us work for our own interest, for no one will do it for us. And, Comrades, you are certainly aware that the dog man is playing every card to put the trapper in the hole. * * * Comrades of the trap line and trail, I wish to ask your ideas as to whether it is advisable to stick to the taking of the fur and game late and early, all the year around. We know that we all like the sport, and the trapper is a little greedy, as well as people of other occupations. But, is it wise to take a mink, fox or other fur bearing animal so late or early in the season that the skin is not worth more than one-third of what the same skin would have brought in a prime condition? On the 18th day of March, 1912, a neighbor, who had put in many a day on the trap line with the writer, a man who with his three younger brothers makes a business of trapping every season and makes good money, came to my house with a female fox skin that he had just caught. I glanced at the skin and remarked that the skin was of but little value. My friend replied in an angry tone, ""No. It ain't!"" And that is not the worst of it--she would have soon had five young foxes. I said, ""You will keep it right up, won't you, Fred."" ""No, I am done now,"" he answered. But I said, ""Fred, that is what you say every year."" The skin was large for a female fox, and had it been caught any time from November to the last of January, it would have brought five or six dollars; but the best that he could get for the skin was three dollars. This is only one case of many, which came under my observation, and especially in the case of taking skunks after they are so badly rubbed that they will not bring more than half the price of prime skins. Now in the case mentioned above, of the female fox, the loss in the price of the skin was small compared to that of the young foxes whose skins would have been worth, next November, or December, in the neighborhood of twenty dollars. In this particular case, my friend would have got the most of those young foxes if not all of them, for the fox den was on his premises, and not far from his house. Now, comrades, let us stop this catching of unprime furs--it is our bread and butter. Let us stop wasting it, for there are but few trappers, who have any more of this world's goods than he needs. Let every trapper do all that he can to put a stop to this waste of fur by catching the fur bearers, when their skins are not more than one-half their value--and many are taken that are practically worthless. We must do all that is in our power to stop a wasteful slaughter of the fur bearing animals, for they are already becoming far too scarce; both for the trappers' benefit, as well as those who wear the finished goods. Comrades, instead of slaughtering the fur bearers during the season of unprime furs, let us look up our trapping grounds, for the coming season, and have all preparations made, and our plans well laid. Then when the season of prime furs arrives, let us take to the trap line and follow it diligently for two or three months, then drop the fox, skunk, mink, coon and opossum and put in more time on beavers, otters, and muskrats. This applies to the middle, northern and southern states, while those in the far north, can, of course, continue to take the fox, mink, etc., longer, but it is not good policy for the northern trapper, even to keep up the good work so long as to ""kill the goose that lays the golden egg."" * * * I notice that some of the comrades are complaining that they do not get a square deal from some of the fur buyers. Shame! shame! brothers. Do you not know that the Fur Dealer is not even making a living profit out of your pelts? That is the reason why there are so many in the business. And do they not always urge the trapper to send in his furs early for fear there will be a drop in the price, and the poor trapper will lose on the price of his furs? Now, boys, can't you see that the average fur buyer is awfully good to the poor trapper? But comrades, are not we, the trappers, partly to blame for this unfair deal? Are we careful that our furs are at least fairly prime and carefully cured and handled? Are we always careful when making our estimate to give a fair grade ourselves? This, comrades, we should always be careful to do, and then we should never ship our furs only to parties who are willing to hold them until they have quoted what price they can pay for the bunch. If the prices are not satisfactory, the fur dealer should have agreed with the shipper before the furs were shipped to him to pay one-half of all express charges, and either return the furs to the shipper or to any house in their city that the shipper may designate. Now, comrades, make some such bargain with your dealer, and if you do not get a square deal do not be shy in giving the transaction with the dealer's name. * * * Comrades of the trap line, come down to camp and let us talk over this question of the fast disappearance of the furbearing animals. The fact of timber becoming scarce has made nearly every one timber-mad--no, that is not right, I mean money-mad--and they wish to secure this money through the fast increasing value of timber. In the late sixties, right here in sight of where I am sitting, I saw as nice white pine cut and put into log heaps, burned up for the purpose of clearing the land, as ever grew. Now, boys, I liken the trapper and the dig-'em-out and the dog-hunter to our ancestors in the wasting of timber, only our ancestors at that time could not see the value of the timber that they were wasting. The trapper, the dig 'em-out and the dog-hunter are all money-mad, made so by the high prices of fur. But unlike our ancestors, the trapper, dig'em-out and dog-hunter should be able to see the folly in taking the furbearers when in an unprime condition, because we all know the difference in the value of a fox, a skunk, a mink, or the skin of any other fur-bearing animal taken in September or late in the spring when unprime, than the same skins would be worth if taken in November or any month during the winter. I trapped in three different states in the South last season (1912) and I met with trappers and dog-hunters who admitted that they trapped and hunted in September. We saw one trapper who had four large mink also quite a bunch of other furs, consisting of coon, muskrats, civet and skunk; the trapper said that the mink were caught last September or the first of October. He wanted six dollars for the four mink. Just think of those four large mink being offered for six dollars and he could not get a buyer at that price. The rest of his early caught furs ranked with the same grade as the mink. Comrades, just think that over and see how foolish we are to begin trapping so early in the season. These same mink, had they been caught the last of November or in December, would have been worth, easily, six or seven dollars apiece. This same party had two mink that he had caught the first of November and he asked five dollars apiece for them and they were not near as large as those caught in September. Now, brothers of the trap line, the most of us will admit that we are not overstocked with worldly goods and we are not to be blamed for getting a little money-mad; but when we get so money-mad that it makes us so blind that we not only destroy our pleasure but we throw away from twenty-five cents on a muskrat and four to six dollars on a fox or mink we should stop and think! While out in camp on our fishing trips this summer, let us invite all of the boys of the neighborhood to come and let us talk this matter over with them and show them how lame we are to indulge in this early and late trapping and hunting of the furbearing animals. Let us induce the boys to become readers of the H-T-T, one of the greatest sporting magazines of the world, and through the columns of this magazine, put up their fight for the protection of the furbearer and the song birds. Unless the trapper puts up his own fight for the protection of the furbearers, they will soon be exterminated. The dog-man is now trying to place a tariff on the trappers' bread and butter in placing a bounty on the furbearer to induce the money-mad trapper to destroy the furbearer during the summer when their fur is worthless. Also, let us have a little chat with the dig 'em-outs or den-destroyers. Boys, what is the difference how the skunk or coon is caught, whether by the steel trap or by dig'em-outs or by the dog; if the animal is caught is it gone, isn't it all the same? Well, it looks to the fellow up the tree as though there was quite a difference. Now comrades, if we dig out a skunk, that den, that habitation is gone, is it not, and there is nothing left to induce other skunks to frequent that location. Now, as to hunting the coon and possum with the dog, two-thirds of the time the coon or possum is treed in a den tree or rock and the tree is cut down and the rock or other den is destroyed and you will get no more coon or possum at that place. If this work of destroying the dens of the skunk and the coon is thoroughly practiced, the dens will soon be gone and with the disappearance of the dens the skunk and the coon also disappear. If the dig'em-out or dog hunter, when he found that he must destroy a den in order to get his game, would leave it or get the animals in some other way without destroying the den, then there could be no objection to the dig'em-outs or to dog-hunting. Now, comrades, I will give some of my own experience in regard to this destroying of den trees. I trapped for a short time around a slough or pond in Alabama two years ago. The large timber in the vicinity of this pond was mostly oak and lumbermen were cutting this timber and taking it out. Coon were quite plentiful around this pond when I first began trapping there but I soon noticed that signs were fast disappearing and I could not think what the cause was. I went to another pond or rather a swamp about two miles from this pond where I again found coon quite plentiful. Not long after I had moved my traps to this other slough a party of negroes came to my camp; they had five dogs. I inquired what luck they were having and they complained that since the timber had been cut around Swan Pond there were no den trees for coon or possum and they were all gone. When these colored people told me what the trouble was I could readily account for the fast disappearance of the coon signs about the pond. I went to the same pond again this past season and while I found a few signs I did not consider it worthwhile to put out a line of traps so I went on to the swamp and put out my traps. It made me two miles further travel in that direction but it paid me just the same. Comrades, let us induce all the boys to come to camp where we can consult with them and let us get a move on us and locate our trapping grounds and make all preparations for the trapping season. This will enable us when the fur is prime to make more money in two months than we do in four months when we indulge in this September and unprime fur trapping. At the same time we will be able to lift our traps while there is still some of the furbearers left and we have not ""killed the goose that lays the golden egg."" CHAPTER XXVIII. The Passing of the Fur bearer. Well, boys, I suppose you are well pleased with the bounty law in this state, (Pennsylvania) as it now is? While it is doubtful if I shall ever again be able to follow the trap line, I am nevertheless as much, and perhaps more, interested in the welfare of the trapper, than when I was able to follow a line of traps. I am inclined to think that the present bounty law (1907) will not only be a damage to the trapper but also to the state. People who never thought of trapping before are now preparing to trap, and some are already at it, and their cry is, Bounty! Bounty! It reminds me of John Chinaman when gold was discovered at Cripple Creek, Colorado. All John could say in his rush for gold, was Cripple Creek, Cripple Creek! Fortunately the greater part of this class of trappers will catch but few of the shyer animals (and the best fur bearers). It was the Game Clubs that asked for and received the Bounty Law. Now if the bird hunter will leave his trained bird dog at home, and walk up to the birds he shoots, he will get plenty of exercise, and the game birds will soon be more plentiful--but I suppose this would not be sportsmanlike. I am well acquainted with a man who is a member of a Game Club; also a game warden. A neighbor of mine who is a good trapper was visiting me a few days ago and he told me of a little matter that took place between the game warden and sportsman in question, and himself. My neighbor said that he was at the place of business of the Game Warden ----, and he said to my neighbor, ""There are three traps you can have for I have no use for them. My dog got in one of them, and I brought the things home with me. I should have thrown them in the river."" When my neighbor came to look at the traps he found his own private mark on the traps, so he said to the warden that they were his traps, for there was his own private mark. The warden replied that he couldn't help that, and that there were three more over at the house that he could get if he wanted to. When my neighbor went to get the other traps he found that they were not his traps, but he knew by the mark on them the traps belonged to his neighbor, so he told the warden about it. Now the intention of the true sportsman is to kill two birds with one stone through the Bounty Law; destroy the fur bearer, and by so doing, do away with what I have heard many a true sportsman call a nuisance--the trapper and his traps. Apparently this state or its lawmakers, look upon the game business and the fur industry in a very different light from what many do. Many states throughout the Union are enacting laws to protect the fur bearing animals of their respective states, and are only placing bounties on such animals as are of little use as fur bearers, and are destructive to stock. No doubt but that these states look upon the hundreds of thousands of dollars put into the pockets of their citizens through the trapper and his products, the same as they would upon equal amount of money brought into their respective commonwealths through any other industry. I believe it would have been well to have had a bounty of $2.00 on a wild cat, and 50 cents or $1.00 on a weasel, and the same on hawks. I would like to have a little private talk with the trappers of Pennsylvania. I do not wish to go away from home to give advice, for usually unsought-for advice will reach about the same distance that the giver's hat rim does. Boys, remember that this is private--just between you and I. When we get ready to set our traps about the first of November, let's try to--Oh, well, you kick, do you? You say that the bounty trapper will have everything caught before the first of November. That is true to a certain extent, but we can't help that, for you know we are not true sportsmen, so all we can do is to stick to common sense. What I was about to say, boys, when we set our traps about the first of November, was, let's try to set our traps so as to avoid catching our neighbor's cats and dogs. If by mistake we should catch a neighbor's cat, in freezing weather, and the cat's foot is frozen, kill the poor thing at once and don't let it out to remain a poor cripple the remainder of its life. And say, boys, don't you think it would be a good idea to get the consent of the farmers to allow you to set traps on their premises, wherever you can do so? And don't you think it would be best to be very careful to not break down the farmer's fences and leave their bars and gates open when we pass through them tending our traps? In fact, we should be very careful and do as little damage as possible, for you know we trappers are not true sportsmen. The true sportsman can buy or lease lands and have their private game preserves, so let us try to keep on the right side of the farmer or there will soon be a time when we will have no place to set our traps. * * * Certain game club men who are headed by a certain M. D. are circulating a petition to both branches of the Legislature and the Governor, to have a law passed to abolish bear trapping in Pennsylvania. This M. D.'s excuse is a plea of humanity, claiming that many bear are caught and allowed to remain in the trap until the bear gnaws or twists off his foot and often the bear is caught the second time and another is taken off, when the bear is destined to go through life on two feet. Now in all of my more than fifty years of bear trapping, I have never known a bear to gnaw his foot in the least degree. Neither have I had a bear twist off his foot when caught in a trap that has a spread of jaws no larger than 12 inches, which will catch a bear through the thick of a foot. The Newhouse No. 5 bear trap which is the most common trap used in bear trapping, has a spread of jaws of 11 1/4 inches. The law which is now (1910) in force in this state provided that a bear trap must be looked to at least every forty-eight hours. Under these conditions, there is no danger of a bear twisting off a foot. It is true that if a trap is used with a grasp high enough to catch above the foot and the bear is allowed to remain in the trap for a long time, they will sometimes twist off a foot. But this sympathetic M. D. makes no mention of the bear that is wounded by a gunshot, escapes and lies for weeks, and then dies or recovers as the case may be. The wounding of a bear from a gunshot is far more liable to occur than it is to take a bear's foot by being caught in a trap. This sympathetic doctor makes no mention of the farmer who has a number of sheep killed by bears, which is almost an every day occurrence during the summer season in any section where bear frequent. Now, Brother Trappers, it is not the great sympathy that these gentlemen club men have for the bear. No, not in the least. What these gentlemen want is to drive the lowly bear trapper out of business, so that those very sympathetic gentlemen may more easily kill a bear without losing too much of their precious sweat, and not be compelled to get too far from camp and the champagne bottle. Now, Brother Bear Trappers, my object in writing these few lines is to ask you and each of you to write your respective representative at once, advising him that you are opposed to any law to abolish the trapping of the bear. I believe that I was the first to advocate some remedy against the wasteful slaughter of the fur bearing animals through the medium of our favorite magazine, the Hunter-Trader-Trapper. I urged that the remedy was with the large raw fur dealers by refusing to accept skins that were not in a reasonably prime condition. Since my writing, other more capable writers have taken up the matter and have advocated a remedy from the same standpoint. Now by close observation I have become satisfied that there is no use of looking further in that direction for a remedy of this wasteful slaughter of the fur bearing animals. The city fur dealers receive the goods which consist of all manner of skins and all grades from good to poor and worthless. In most cases the dealer received the goods from local dealers who have gathered the furs up from among the trappers, paying such prices as he thought would leave a fair profit on the whole bunch. In most cases paying more for the poorer grade than it was really worth, while paying far less than the prime skins were worth. [Illustration: WOODCOCK ON THE TRAP LINE 1912.] Now the dealer was hardly to be blamed for this sort of transaction, for it was the only way that he could make a deal with the trapper. The city dealer is in the same fix as the local dealer. He quotes furs from number one down to number four and trash, making up on the better grades what he may have lost on the poorer. Thus you see there is no one out anything except the trapper, who will insist on trapping too early in the season, as well as too late in the spring of the year. Now we will say to the brother trappers of Pennsylvania and other states as well, that we are at the parting of the ways, allowing us to use the term. We must do something desperate if we wish to save the fur bearers from becoming extinct and save the trappers' pleasure and what profit he may derive from the business. Now the only remedy is a closed season on all fur bearing animals. If we are to derive any special benefit from a closed season, the open season must be made short, for every trapper of much experience knows that the fur bearers of Pennsylvania have become extremely scarce in the past few years. In fact in some parts there is but little stock left to build on. I would say that not more than two months of open season should be allowed, if we get real benefit from a closed season, and taking the whole state into consideration, I believe that November and December would give the best general satisfaction. Now, brother trappers, do not be hard on me because I advocate a shorter season to be open than some trappers seem to be in favor of. Well, we had the bounty law and we all have seen the results. I would like to say here that the bounty law is still doing its work of annihilation. The law is still in force as it appears on the face of it, but nevertheless there has been no appropriation made by the legislature to pay the bounty. Some trappers do not know but what they will get the bounty until they present these certificates for payment, then to learn that there is no bounty for them. Other persons and would-be trappers are getting the certificates and holding them, thinking that there will be an appropriation made to pay this bounty. In this they will also find their mistake. Now, brother trappers, we all know that the Lord helps him, who helps himself and if we would save the fur bearing animals from complete annihilation we must each of us do our part and not depend on some one else doing the work. Let us all who would have a closed season on mink, fox, skunk and muskrat get a petition to that effect and circulate it. Get your merchant, doctor, and every other business man in your neighborhood to sign the petition and as many others as we possibly can. Now, my dear friends, let us remember that the gentleman sportsman will not help us in this matter and if we would have a closed season we must push this matter ourselves. In my upwards of fifty years on the trap line and the trail, I have always done my part (as I saw it) to stop wasteful slaughter of game and the fur bearers and I will do the very best that I am able in this matter, although I realize that my days on the trap line are few. Now, comrades, on the fourth of July (1910), the primaries to nominate candidates to represent the people of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, will be held. Let every trapper of the state, who is interested in the matter of a closed season on our fur bearing animals get out and talk with their candidates whom they wish to represent them at the next assembly. Let him know that you wish a law passed at the next legislature giving a closed season on fur bearing animals. We should bear in mind, that writing and talking without action will not do. We must get busy at once if we would accomplish anything. CHAPTER XXIX. Destruction of Game and Game Birds. Of late (1908) there has been much writing and law making in an attempt to preserve the game of this commonwealth, and it reminds one of the old adage of ""Locking the Barn Door, after the Horse was Stolen."" At the last Assembly of the Pennsylvania Legislature, there was a Bounty Law passed with an appropriation of $50,000 to pay the bounty on the different animals. The appropriation was exhausted almost before the trapping season had begun, or at least should have begun, so far as the trapper's interest was concerned. Now, I wish to speak of the bounty as to fox and mink, and I wish to speak of an incident that came under my observation. A neighbor of mine makes a business of trapping each fall; there were three in the family, who trapped last fall. They caught 11 fox, 4 mink, 8 coon, 2 weasel and 1 wildcat. This catch was all made before the 20th of October and sold for $34.45, or including bounty, $66.45. Now, had this same fur been caught in November or December, the fur alone would have brought at least $68.00, and the taxpayers would have been $32.00 ahead. I also know of another party who dug out two nests of young mink and got nine young ones. The old mink escaped. I asked this man why he did not let them go until fall or winter, as these dens were near his mill? He informed me that he never fooled away any time trapping and had he left them go until fall the mink would have been gone and now he was $6.50 ahead. Now, this man had actually destroyed at least $30 worth of furs to get $6.50 in bounty. While I think that the bounty on wildcats and weasel is all right, I do not think a bounty on fox and mink at all necessary. The high price their fur brings will induce the trapper to take all that the bounty would induce him to do, and at a time when the fur will bring more than a great deal of early caught furs would bring, including the bounty. It is quite doubtful as to mink being very destructive to birds or their nests, and as to the destruction of poultry, it is a very easy and inexpensive matter for any poultry raiser to arrange his poultry house so as to take any prowling mink that should come about his premises. Now, I would suggest to the bird hunter, or as he prefers to be called, ""sportsman,"" that if he will leave his automatic gun and his bird dog at home, and merely take a good double-barrel breechloader and go into the bush, and ""walk up"" his birds, instead of having a dog to show the bird to him, he will do far more to protect the game bird than any bounty law will do! This the sportsman must do, or the game birds of this state will soon be a thing of the past. About 1870, there was a move begun to check the slaughter of the deer in this state, but it was only in a half-hearted way. The writer circulated the first petition to get the law enacted prohibiting the hounding of deer. After some years the law prohibited the chasing of deer with dogs, but the law could not be enforced for the very reason that these same sportsmen wished to hound deer. He would go on to the streams where there were but few inhabitants, and hire all of the people living in the neighborhood to take their dogs to the hills and start them on the trail of deer. The ""sportsman"" would lay in ambush and shoot the deer when they came to water, providing they were able to see the sights on their guns sufficiently clear to get a bead on the deer. These ""sportsmen"" would pay the natives a good sum for their services and would often buy hounds at high prices and bring them to the locality where they intended to hound deer and pay some one living in the neighborhood a good price to keep their dogs from one season to another. These ""sportsmen"" were sure to make the constable, whose duty it was to report this violation of the deer law, a present of a fine fishing rod or some other article which might be a ten or twenty dollar bill. Now, under these conditions it was next to impossible to get any one who knew anything about the transaction to make a complaint, or even be a witness against those transgressors of the deer or hounding law. But in time the law was made sufficiently stringent as to virtually put a stop to this most cruel practice of deer hunting. But now another bad thing came into vogue. Non-residents were allowed to go into the woods where they would camp from the first day of the open season for deer until the close and often some days after. Now, ""the horse has been stolen."" The deer in this state are virtually gone. ""The door has been strongly locked, but it is now too late."" This game rule applies to the game fish of the state and unless there are laws enacted which will apply more closely to the preservation of the game birds, than a closed season and a bounty or scalp law, the game birds will soon go the way of the deer and the game fish too. I wish to say a word to our friends on the Pacific Coast as to the slaughter of game and especially that of deer. I saw a slaughter of deer in nearly all of the states west of the Rocky Mountains that was cruel. In California, in 1904, I saw men kill deer seemingly for no other purpose than the desire to kill, or as I put it, the desire to murder. I saw deer killed when the slayer positively knew that there could not be any use made of the carcass. I saw deer killed when only a fry would be taken from the ham, the remainder of the carcass left to lay without even the pretense of dressing. It was a common occurrence to kill deer for no other purpose than to feed dogs. One day I was standing by a man on a sand bar on the bank of a river when we noticed a doe a few rods away looking at us. The man drew his gun to his shoulder in the act of shooting and I exclaimed, ""My God, man, you are not going to shoot that deer, are you?"" My words were not out of my mouth when the gun cracked. The deer was mortally wounded and ran directly towards us, making desperate efforts to keep its feet. It fell dead within ten feet of where we were standing. I walked away. The slayer of the innocent creature stood and gazed at it a moment and then with his foot he pushed it off the bar into the river. I hope I may never see another such sight. It was June and the doe was heavy with fawn and this man knew that he could make no use of this deer whatever. I saw much wasteful slaughter of deer but none quite so inhuman as the one mentioned. The game laws of the Pacific Coast were not enforced. When well back in the mountains it was a rare thing to hear the game laws spoken of, not even by the game wardens. Now I think that all who are lovers of the woods and fields should join in a general move to protect this wasteful slaughter of all game and game birds, no matter whether we are the so-called ""pot hunter"" or the ""gentleman sportsman,"" but none will regret this unreasonable waste of game more than those who are living back in the mountains, where game is most plentiful, when it is gone. Nor none will get more benefit and pleasure from the very fact that they are living in a game section, yet these are the ones who do not seem to care how great the slaughter, apparently never taking it into consideration that the present rate of slaughter will soon leave their game laden section as bare of game as that of the older settled countries. Comrades, let us all join in the preservation of what game and fish there is left, whether we may be called pot hunters or gentlemen sportsmen. I would be the last one to wish to deprive any trapper or camper from making good use of game at any time when in camp, but let us be careful about the waste of it. * * * Comrades of the trap line, you of course are aware that a trapper is considered of small account by those who make or cause to be made, the game laws of this state (Pennsylvania), and brother trapper, are we not as much to blame as the ones who concoct the game laws to their own liking? The accompanying picture will show a part of the confiscation from the writer by the game laws of Pennsylvania and this same confiscation applies to every trapper in the state to a more or less extent. Had we presented our side of this question to our respective representatives in a clear and reasonable light would we not get a square deal? If not, then why not? We are aware that the man with the dollar has a great influence in comparison with the poor trapper, but are there not ten of the poor trappers to one of the dollar men and have we not the just and reasonable side of the question? Do not our representatives know that the raw fur industry of the state is of greater importance, financially, than the wheat crop of the state, for which the legislature does all it can in the way of appropriations to help the farmer to increase the yield of wheat? Had this been shown to the assembly, would it not have passed laws to protect the fur-bearers of the state, instead of bounty laws to exterminate the fur-bearer, and this act at the expense of the public? Every dollar that is appropriated by the House of Representatives in the way of bounty on so-called noxious animals, must come from the pockets of the taxpayers, and is not a dollar saved in the way of protecting the fur-bearers of the state equivalent to a dollar produced from a bushel of wheat? Now, the dollar man will tell us that the fox and mink are very destructive to game and game birds. This, to a great extent, is a mere bugaboo, or an excuse to knock out the trapper. There is little doubt but that a fox occasionally kills a grouse or partridge or a rabbit. Admitting this to be the case, is not a good fox or mink skin worth ten times as much to the trapper as a partridge or rabbit is to the dollar man? But that is not all, if it is the pleasure of an individual to amuse himself with the traps, why should he be deprived of that pleasure? It is certain that the trap will not cause any more harm in the way of damage or in a cruel manner, than a dog will. While the dollar man makes a plea in defense of game, it is generally known that his plea is in reality in defense of his manner of sporting, regardless of any desires that the poor trapper may have and there are certainly but few trappers but wish to see the game and game birds preserved as well as the dollar man does. I doubt if there is a man in the State of Pennsylvania who has worked longer, or done more according to his ability, to protect and preserve game than the writer has, and as to the dog, he has no greater friend than the writer. As to the preservation of game and game birds, I believe in preserving it in a substantial way and not in a mythical manner, under the pretext of a bounty on noxious animals and then pass laws that do away with the trap, the most effective implement there is in taking that noxious animal. As the game and bounty laws of Pennsylvania stand today, it reminds one of the old lady who told the boy that he could go in swimming, but he must not go near the water. Now, I believe in a bounty on wildcats, hawks and weasel, sufficient to induce the poor man to spend the time necessary to exterminate these animals when an opportunity comes to him, for the dollar man will not take the trouble to do so. But the only effective bounty law must be placed on the game man, in the way of cutting his bag limit of birds for a single day and the season in two, and placing a closed season of five years on deer. There is much said as to the rapid decrease of game. Now, so far as this applies to deer, and my observation extends over four counties of the state, at the present decrease (1913) of the deer, there will not be a deer left in these four counties at the end of five years and the deer law is being continually violated. In order to enforce the game laws of the state, the laws should be as near equal as possible, in giving each man his way of enjoying his manner of out-door sport, either in fishing, hunting or trapping. We are aware that there must be a limit to man's idea of sport. There are plenty of men, for instance, who enjoy the use of dynamite in fishing, in killing all the fish in the stream, small fish along with the large ones, also all kinds of fish that happen to be in the pool where the dynamite is used. It may be the pleasure of other sportsmen to kill birds of all kinds and also deer at any and all times of the year. This kind of work can not be allowed. In order to enforce the game laws, the laws must be in harmony with the greatest number of people possible, and not enact game laws that deprives a goodly portion of the people (I refer to the trapper) of their pleasure simply to gratify a certain class of sportsmen. The game wardens will then find it hard enough to enforce the law. Say, comrades, I wish to call your attention to an article in the December number of H-T-T, 1912, by Mr. J. R. Bachelder. Mr. Bachelder is an old and respected man and one of the rural mail carriers of Cameron County. Mr. Bachelder describes how the trap law of Pennsylvania has deprived him of the only pleasure that he was able to enjoy in the open, that of tending a few traps. And comrades, we of the trap line and trail, who are not blessed with the dollar and the automobile, will soon find that our pleasures in the open, like Mr. Bachelder's, are laid by for all time. If the club man, through his leasing policies and the trespass law that he has before the House of Representatives, becomes a law, we can go away back and sit down. But, comrades, I consider that we are to blame to a large extent for these ""one man"" game laws. Had we come out at the right time and fought for our rights in the open instead of slinking back in the dark, whining, I believe that the law, as applied to the trap, would be different and I should not violate the game laws after passed, no matter if they are not wholly to my liking. The professional sportsman makes a great talk about the amount of birds that the fox destroys. Now, the facts are, one weasel or snake will destroy more rabbits or birds and birds' eggs than a dozen foxes. The fox gets the greater part of his food from the field mouse. This fact any close observer knows. * * * Brother trappers, you are aware that the nations--the United States, Great Britain, Japan and Russia, have taken the fur seal under their protection, and will protect the seal and sell their skins. I wish to ask you, brother trapper, if your wife, daughter or sweetheart wears furs made of the seal skin. No? Well, your wife, daughter or sweetheart does wear furs made from the fur bearer that runs on the hillside back of your house. Then, why do you stand for a bounty on these animals from which the furs are made for your wife, daughter or sweetheart to wear, to hasten the extinction of these fur-bearers, while the millionaire gives the word to the government, and the fur-bearer of the millionaire is protected at the expense of the people? Say, you wives, daughters or sweethearts of the trapper, do you stand for this kind of a deal? A few words in regard to the protection of the game and game birds: I think that every lover of outdoor life should be willing to have a reasonable number to the bag limit of either game birds or game animals, and lend a hand in protecting the game to the amount of the bag limit. Oh, you find fault with the game laws--you say that the laws are not just to all alike. Well, in one sense of the word this is true. The state law confiscated your traps, then placed a bounty on noxious animals, and then fines you heavily if you set a trap in a way so as to be able to catch one of these noxious animals (queer laws); but, nevertheless, we should try to protect our game if we are to have any left. At the rate the game is being slaughtered at the present time, there will not be a deer left in the State of Pennsylvania, and but very little game of any kind. You say that it is a hard matter to protect the game--that is true; for it is hard to get local game wardens that are of much account. A man of much principle and business qualifications will not accept the position, as he does not like to arrest a neighbor for fear of hurting his regular line of business. The State Game Wardens are not acquainted with the different game localities, and with the people who have but little or no regard for the game laws of the state. I will give an instance which came under my observation the past season: The game laws of Pennsylvania prohibit the use of buckshot in deer hunting, and the law also prohibits the killing of does. Now, a man who was hunting deer with a shotgun loaded with buckshot, was looking at another hunter's gun, which was a .32 Special Winchester; the shotgun man noticed the small caliber of the Winchester, asked the party who had the rifle (knowing nothing of the shooting power of the Winchester), if he expected to kill anything with that little thing, and at the same time stating that good buckshot gun was the thing to hunt deer with. When asked if he did not know that the law forbade the use of buckshot in deer hunting, he replied, ""Oh to ---- with the law!"" They knocked me out of my bear traps, and the next thing they will do is to pass a law to prohibit hunting with a gun that costs less than $500.00. At the same time, and in this same place, a party killed a large doe that had its tail entirely shot away and several buckshot were found in its body. I will tell a little joke that was got off on one of the State Game Wardens as told by himself in the hotel at this place, which is a fact, and took place in these same woods: The Warden was telling a crowd at the hotel how his attention had been called to a doe that some one had killed and hung up in a certain place in the woods. The Warden said he went and found the deer and watched for ten days, but no one came for the deer. A party standing by said to the Warden, ""Oh, that is a way we have of fixing you fellows--we kill a doe, hang it up on the outskirts of the deer hunting grounds, then give you notice of it, and while you are watching the dead deer, we are killing the live ones."" The Warden, after listening to the man's story, remarked, ""Well by Jonathan! that is one on me--come on."" The above joke was actually got off here at the hotel in this town. The number of bears killed in this part, fall of 1911, notwithstanding that the use of steel traps is prohibited, was larger than has been in years. A party of thirteen from this place went into the woods on the Trout River, and during the ten or twelve days they were there, they killed seven bears--five in one day. And there were several deer killed. Now comrades, while we can't all agree on the justification of the game laws, we should all join hands and try to protect what little game we have left by getting the bag limit materially cut down, and give fifteen days more time to the hunter. Then stand by the law, or soon the game will all be gone with the exception of a few cotton-tails and what game is on private reserves, and posted lands. CHAPTER XXX. Southern Experiences on the Trap Line. Comrades of the trap line, I am not able to report a large catch of furs the past season, 1910. I did not catch much fur, but say, boys, I had a good deal of experience nevertheless. I will try to tell of conditions as I found them in North Carolina. I first stopped in Lee County, where I met Mr. A. L. Lawrence, one of the _Hunter-Trader-Trapper's_ most ardent friends. After stopping here a few days and seeing some of the sights in Lee and Moore Counties, Mr. Lawrence, now my friend and partner, a gentleman whom I had never known before, started for Bladen Co., N. C., where we expected to be kept up a good portion of the night in order to keep up with the skinning and stretching of the numerous furbearing animals caught during the day. Well boys, I will say that we were not troubled in this matter at least. While there is more fur in that section than in the north, there are also more disadvantages to be met with, than we have here. The majority of people that one meets with in the South are very kind and obliging. Nevertheless you will find it somewhat difficult to find suitable grounds to set your camp, providing the parties are aware that your intentions are to put out a line of traps. Remember that nearly every farmer has a drove of hogs that run in the woods, and the feeding grounds of the razorback is in the bottoms along the creeks and rivers. Naturally the farmer is a little fearful of his pigs being caught, so he says that the better way is to keep ""shet"" of the trappers, especially those that are strangers to the neighborhood. This is not the only way that the razorback gets in his work, and a good bit of work they get in too. The razorback is a powerful hunter, and it does not require a powerful animal scent to draw the razorback to the trap. To avoid the porker the trap must be set three inches below the water or six feet above the ground. As foxes are not given to tree climbing as a usual thing the trapper is sorely tried to devise schemes to take the fox in a section where the razorback is getting in his work. He is found in most places in the South, although there are some counties and even townships that have a stock law. The great difficulty with a non-resident or a stranger in getting a site to camp on, is that he must be where he can use the water from some one's well, as springs are not very plenty. The water in the branches, small streams or rivers are not such that a trapper should use; there is such a heavy drainage from swamps that are full of decayed vegetation, so that the trapper would soon be looking for a doctor rather than for opossum and coon. On South River near Parkersburg, we got a good place to camp, and the people were very kind and neighborly. Mr. Green, the postmaster at Parkersburg, and his family, with whom we stopped a short time before going into camp, were very kind and generous. The young ladies, daughters of Mr. Green, gave us some fine music on the piano, accompanied with singing during the evenings. About eighteen or twenty miles from Parkersburg on Turnbull Creek where we expected to do the greater part of our trapping, and where mink and coon were quite plentiful with considerable otter signs, we were unable to get a place to camp. The people objected to outside trappers infringing on what they apparently looked upon as their individual right. At the junction of Cape Fear and Black Rivers in Bladen and Pender counties, there is a section of low swampy country, which is a wild country where there is deer and bear as well as furbearers such as otter, mink, muskrats and coon. The latter are quite numerous. There is also wild turkey, quail and ducks on the river. Now this section of the country had a colony of mixed whites and colored people (Mulatto) who lived in these swamps, other people rarely going into that locality. We were informed that there was a good deal of illicit or Blockade Whiskey as the natives call it, made in these swamps. It is said that it is not safe for strangers to be caught in their domain too often. I found that one needs nearly double the number of traps to trap in the swamps or bays, as these swamps are called by the natives. There is so much ground that is covered with water so near alike that the animal has no regular place to travel, as is the case along the open streams. Instead the animals have vast areas of ground to travel over that is partially covered with water, so that the mink or raccoon travels anywhere and everywhere, as it is all alike to the mink and coon. Consequently the trapper needs more traps in order to make the same number of catches as would be possible in a locality where the streams did not spread over such a large scope of land. While the trapper in the South has but little snow or ice to contend with, he will not find it all milk and honey, for the swamps are not a paradise with the gall berry brush, the bamboo briers, saffron sprouts and holly brush. As for game birds, they are not so plentiful, but quail in places are found in good numbers. Wild turkeys are found in small lots scattered all over the country, but by no means plenty: doves are quite plentiful. As for fur bearers there are quite a number of opossum. Coons are not found late in the season to any great extent only in the swamps where they are quite plentiful. Grey foxes are plenty. There are many hunters in the South who hunt with dogs, and they do not take kindly to any other way of taking the furbearers. Otter signs are seen on nearly all of the streams but by no means are they plenty, and every slide is closely watched by trappers living nearby. The ever present razorback is an obstacle in the way of otter trapping, for the trap must be set under the water, and this is not always practical in otter trapping. We must not close this short letter without stating that our friend and partner, Mr. A. L. Lawrence, who was a native of Randolph County, N. C, was an expert trapper, and especially on mink. Mr. Lawrence was a good cook as well as a good trapper. Mr. Lawrence was hard to beat on baking opossum and bread making, but when it came to boiling water without burning it, your humble servant could hold him a close second. Say boys, I forgot to say that you will find Billy the Sneakum just as numerous in Dixie as he is in Pennsylvania. * * * Comrades of the trap line, I am not in condition to write much at this time owing to my health, but, later I hope to be able to give a fuller account of my trapping experiences of 1912 in Alabama, northern Georgia, northwestern North Carolina and southeastern Tennessee. And Comrades, right here I wish to say that through the above mentioned sections of the south, I found nearly every trapper a reader and lover of the _Hunter-Trader-Trapper,_ and many of these readers seemed like old neighbors to the writer, when he met them. Well boys, during all of last year, my health was such that I never again expected to hit the trap line, but as the frost began to turn the leaves of the timber on the hillsides, the trap fever became so high that I was compelled to take a half dozen traps and take to the brush. The first night I got two foxes, the second night I got another fox, three skunk and wife's pet cat. The catching of Timy (the cat) caused wife to put up such a fight, that I was compelled to pull the traps, pack my outfit and start for Alabama. Now boys, I am not going to tell you entirely of my own experience, but of the experiences of other trappers and hunters as told me by them. One trapper told of the killing of a bear in the thick cane brakes in the swamps of the Mississippi. It was against the game laws of Mississippi to kill bear at that time of the year, and as these hunters could not resist the taking of this bear, they put up a job on the bear. There were four of the hunters going through the thick cane brake, when they saw the bear coming toward them. The head man pulled his hunting knife, and told the other hunters to lie down, he dropping to his knees, knife in hand. When the bear was close up to him he sprang up and shouted ""boo"". The bear raised up on its hind feet and the hunter seized the bear and plunged the knife into it. The other hunters sprang to their feet, gun in hand and shot the bear. The party who told me this bear story, said it was a put up job, so as to make it appear that the bear was killed in self defense. [Illustration: A PARTY OF VISITORS AT E. N. WOODCOCK'S CAMP ON THE BANKS OF THE ETAWAH RIVER AT DIKES CREEK, GA.] I know of many excuses to avoid game laws, but this one beats them all. I have had a good deal of experience in game hunting, but never had the luck to have a bear run on to me in this manner. I will tell a panther story, which a man told me that happened some year ago, in North Carolina, near the Tennessee line. The man was in a small shack, and he often heard panthers screaming about the shack, and finally one night when he had some fresh deer meat in the shack, the man was awakened by some animal trying to pull up a roof board. The roof of the shack was not more than six or eight feet from the ground floor, and soon the panther raised up a board sufficient to run a foot down through the crack. The man stood watching the game, and when the foot came through the crack, the man seized the panther by the foot, and a terrible fight began. The hunter finally cut a foot of the panther off, and stabbed it with his knife until he killed it. The hunter had a rug made of the skin of this panther, which he intends to keep in the family for all time to come. I think that this hunter is doing the right thing in so doing. I will now give a little of my own experience, but it is not in the way of an adventure with either a bear or panther, but, no doubt, I was just as nervous for a time as those who had the reported adventure with the bear and the panther. The last days of December, 1912, I went into camp about twelve or fourteen miles from Crandel, near the Tennessee line. Early the next morning after going into camp, a man came to the camp and asked many questions as to what I was doing. How long I was going to be there? Where I was from? Also many other similar questions, and then went away. That evening four or five men came to my tent, and asked about the same questions that the man in the morning had asked. When I stepped outside of the tent next morning, there were three or four bunches of hickory withes standing against the guy ropes of the tent. I did not know what those hickory withes meant, but surmised that some jealous trapper had put them there as a warning for me to get out. But it was not long after daylight, when a man came to camp, and said that I was suspicioned of being a spy in search of blockaders. I told this man that there could be nothing farther from it, that that would be the last thing I would mix up in, even if I knew of any such business, that I was simply a trapper and had no other business there. The man, said that he knew that as soon as he heard my name for he had known of me for the past four years, ever since he had been a reader of the _H-T-T._ This gentleman told me not to worry, but to stay in my tent a day or two before going out to set my traps, and everything would be all right. I hardly knew what to do, but as it was raining I could not well break camp that night. Five or six men came to camp. Some were those who had been there before, and questioned me as to my business there. But now they were acting entirely different. Now these gentlemen rushed in with hands extended to shake hands and welcome me and offer me any assistance that they were able to give, and nearly all of them offered me a drachm of corn juice. I stayed a few days longer in camp there, and each day friends grew more numerous and corn juice more plentiful. I stayed a day or two and saw that friends were going to be so numerous that it would be next to impossible for me to get out on the trap line for some days at least, so broke camp and pulled for Pennsylvania. CHAPTER XXXI. On the Trap and Trot Line in the South--Fall of 1912. Well, comrades of the trap line, as I see so many interesting letters from trappers in the H-T-T, the best of all sporting magazines, I will relate some of my experiences in the South, season of 1912. During the latter part of the winter and the greater part of the summer, my health was so poor that I never again expected to be able to enjoy the pleasures of the trap line. But as time passed and I was able to get out into the fields and wander about, I became stronger from day to day until in the last days of October, when the frost began to crisp the air and the leaves on the trees on the hillsides became a golden hue, it drove the trapping fever into me to such a degree that I was unable to resist the temptation any longer. I took six or eight traps and went to the brush within sight of the house. I was obliged to use a good, strong staff to climb the hill with and could only take a few steps at a time, without stopping to take my breath. But, boys, I found this sort of exercise better for me than the doctor's medicine that I was taking. My first night's catch was two fox. Many of the readers of the H-T-T will remember of seeing my picture with the two fox in the December, 1912, number. The next two nights I got another fox and three skunk and wife's pet cat. The cat business put it up to me and I was compelled to lift my traps and take for other fields. Had I been able to traverse the hills and woods of old Potter County, I could have done far better than I did in the South. My trapping fever had now reached such a high mark that I could no longer stave it off and not being able to travel the hills and streams of this section, hit my feet for Alabama, where I could do the greater part of my work from a boat. After reaching Tryanna, I made a trip up Indian Creek every day by boat to a fish trap dam, which I was unable to get the boat over so was compelled to leave it at the dam and hoof it up the creek to the end of the line. On the way back down the creek each day I would gather up a boat load of drift wood to last for the day. The water being at a very low stage, it caused several rapids, which made it tight nipping to paddle the boat over. I had occasion to stop paddling often as I was continually making sets for mink, rats, coon and opossum, first on one side of the stream and then on the other, so that I had abundance of time to rest. But, comrades of the trap line, this kind of work is much better for an old played-out trapper than pills. While I found trapping conditions here in Alabama different than they were a year ago, I nevertheless got a mink, rat, 'possum or coon nearly every day, but two mink at a single round of traps was the best that I did at any time. There was no otter or beaver in this part of Alabama and but very few fox or skunk, and I found far more trappers than there were a year ago. Many of the trappers were from other states, and last season I did not see or hear of a colored man trapping, but this fall I heard of the dark man and his works daily. One of the worst and most foolish things that the trappers did was their early trapping before furs were any where near in a prime condition. This unwise work was indulged in by the white trappers as well as the negroes. I was unable to get out into the swamps or sloughs to any great extent and it is in the swamps that the coon are found more plentifully. The mink does not take to the swamps as readily as the coon, nevertheless he is found in the swamps as well as along the rivers and smaller streams. If we could only keep down the trapping fever and the desire to get that mink before the other fellow did, it would help us out in a financial way. We saw many mink that were offered for sale here that were over three feet from tip to tip, from 75 cents to $2.00, and the skins went a-begging at that price. Now, comrades, just think of the difference in what those skins would have brought when in a prime condition. The price then would have been from $3.00 to $7.00, and this same rule applied to the coon and muskrats and other fur bearers, and you are aware that the fur bearers throughout the country are rapidly becoming scarcer each year. While I found more mink, coon and muskrats here in Alabama than I did in either Georgia or North Carolina, yet I did not see mink, coon or rat signs in comparison to what they were a year ago, and I do not believe that there was one-third as many mink, coon or muskrats as there was last season. Opossum seem to hold their own fairly well. Well, comrades, the picture here shows the greater part of our Alabama catch of furs. I trapped in Alabama about three weeks when I went to Georgia, where I expected, from what I was told, to find far better trapping than was to be had here in Alabama, but I was sadly disappointed. * * * Leaving Tryanna, Alabama, by wagon, I went to Farley, eighteen miles. There I took a train to Huntsville, then by the Southern R. R. by the way of Chattanooga to Dikes Creek, Georgia, where I went into camp. I camped at this place about two weeks, building two boats, one a good large boat, sufficient to move my whole outfit from point to point, as I moved down the Etowah River, then the Coosa River. The other boat was much smaller, being suited to the trap and trot line. Boys, you who have trapped on the rivers and large streams of the South, know that the traps and the trot line go hand in hand and with only two or three trot lines, to one who is onto the job, you will find them quite profitable as well as a pleasure. In most places you will find ready sale for the fish you catch at 10 to 12 cents a pound. If one runs his trot lines two or three times a day and takes in from 20 to 100 pounds of fish, it is a little item along the financial trail. But, boys, there is a knack in running a trot line in a successful manner as well as a trap line. Where the trot line is run in connection with the trap line, it makes quite an addition to the trapper's job, for he will be out as late as 9 or 10 o'clock before going to bed to run the trot lines, take off the fish and rebait the lines. It is also necessary to put in any spare time that happens your way in digging wigglers, hunting crawfish and other bait. [Illustration: E.N. WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS 1912 CATCH OF ALABAMA FURS.] The boat is an absolute necessity in trapping in the South, as the most of the fur-bearers are found along the rivers and large streams. It is next to an impossibility to make a successful set for mink and coon along the soft, slippery and sloping banks without the boat. And boys, the conditions on the trap line in the South are altogether different from what it is in the North on the clear, gravelly and rocky streams of the North and East sections. It requires a trap one size larger in the South in successful trapping than it does in the North and East. This is owing to the soft, muddy, clay banks and streams. Another thing that is a necessity along the rivers and streams of the South is the trap stake, while on most streams of the North the clog or drag is far better than a stake. I did not find the fur-bearers in Georgia as plentiful as I expected, from what I had been told and trappers were numerous, many of them in house boats. I expected to find some beaver on Pumpkin Vine Creek, a branch of the Etowah River, but they failed to show up on investigation. There is but very few otter in northern and central Georgia and in Georgia, as in Alabama, many trappers began trapping in September. The best catch in one night at our camp was while we were camping at Coosa, on the Coosa River, but it was nothing in comparison to what we did in Alabama last season in a single night's catch. The catch at Coosa in one night was two mink, three coon, three rats and two opossum. This was done with about 20 traps. It was raining at this time, so we kept this bunch of furs three days and until there had been several more pieces added to the bunch. We wanted to get a picture of this bunch of furs and the camp at this place but it continued to rain and we were compelled to skin the animals and let the pictures go. The steamboats are a serious drawback to the trappers on the river in the South. The average trapper plans to get out on his line and fix up as many of his traps as he can after the steamboat passes. On most rivers there is not more than one or two boats passing daily and on some of the rivers, boats do not make more than one or two trips a week. It was the intention of the writer when going to Georgia, to work the trap line all winter, going nearly the entire length of the Alabama River, to the Mississippi line, but met with unexpected conditions that I was unable to endure and was compelled to give up the greater part of the trip, which was a sad disappointment. But comrades, you know that there are but few trappers but what meet with disappointments at times. The game laws of Georgia are a little hard on the trapper and fisherman. The non-resident trapper has to pay a license of fifteen dollars and the local trapper a license of three dollars. (This alludes to the laws of 1912.) That is not the worst part of it. In fact, the license fund, if justly used in the protection of game and game birds and the propagation of game and birds, I would not object to the license. The hard part of the game law of Georgia is the trespass part of it. The trapper must have a written permission from the land owner to trap or fish on any man's land and where the river is the dividing line between different parties owning the land, the trapper or fisherman must have the written permit from both land owners, even though he does not leave his boat to set a trap or place a trot line. Now it is a very difficult thing for a stranger to learn who owns the land and often the owner of the land lives in some city of the North, or elsewhere. Now here is where the shoe pinches the hardest. The fine for trespassing on a man's land is $40.00 and it is the duty of the game warden to arrest any one he finds hunting, trapping or fishing on any man's land without a written permit. Here is the worst of all. The game warden must make the arrest without any notice from the land owner and if the game warden fails to make the arrest, he is liable to the same fine as the one who is doing the trespassing. This is a law that the average land owner never asked for. I had men come to me every day and offer me the privilege of trapping or hunting on their land without any request on my part. I found the majority of the people of Georgia very kind in regard to this trespass matter as well as other matters. It was only a few sporting ""Nabobs"" that concocted this stringent part in the trespass law, contained in the game laws of Georgia. Most other states of the south have as trespass laws, that the land owner must order the arrest. The laws of Alabama allow or at least can not stop the trapper or fisherman from trapping or fishing so long as he keeps within the boundary limits of the river, which is sufficient to give the trapper or fisherman ample ground to camp on. After leaving the Coosa River I went into the extreme northern part of Georgia where I camped for about three weeks and never met a more friendly class of people than within the vicinity of Oakman and Ranger. After leaving this section, I went into camp near Crandel, Ga. From there I went into the Fog Mountains, where I found game fairly plentiful but owing to bad weather and the condition of my health, did not hit the trap line very heavy. CHAPTER XXXII. Trapping in Alabama. Well, comrades of the trap line, as I am getting well up to the seventy notch, and as the chills of zero weather chases one after the other up and down my spinal column, like a dog after a rabbit in a briar patch, and as I am unable to shake off that desire for the trap line, I concluded to go south again to trap. I began an inquiry in several different sections, in states of the South, and finally decided upon Alabama, where a gentleman and a brother trapper by the name of Ford had invited me to come. On the last days of October, 1911, I arrived in Alabama where I met Mr. Ford, whom I found to be a gentleman in all respects, and a member of the M. E. Church. My first day's outing after reaching Mr. Ford's place was on the Tennessee River, raising fish nets, and putting out a few mink traps to ascertain what the complexion of the inner side of a mink's coat was. I got a mink the first night, which I found to be of fairly light color, but not quite light enough to my liking. The setting of more traps was delayed for a few days and we spent the time in tending the fish nets. I have whipped the streams and drowned earthworms for brook trout and other fish, from my childhood days to the present time. I had never done any fishing in large rivers with nets, so you can imagine my feelings when one net after another was raised which contained many fish of different kinds, such as yellow cat, channel cat, buffalo, pickerel, pike, carp, suckers, black bass (called trout in the South) and many other kinds. These fish ran in weight all the way from one-fourth pound up to twenty pounds each, and occasionally a buffalo or yellow catfish much larger. Mr. Ford informed me that often on trot lines they got sturgeon, weighing more than one hundred pounds. We intended to put out a trot line and catch a sturgeon that I might get some oil. It is said that the oil from a sturgeon is a sure cure for rheumatism in the joints, but it rained so much, keeping us busy adjusting our traps, that we did not get any time to get the bait and put out the trot line. So I did not get to see one of those large fellows. Mr. Ford pointed out corn and cotton fields where the corn and cotton was still ungathered and told me that he had trot lines set out all through these fields last spring and caught hundreds of pounds of fish--it hardly seemed possible as the water was then fifteen of twenty feet below the banks of these fields. But in December when it began raining nearly every day, and the water rose so suddenly that I was obliged to leave many of my traps where I had set them around ponds and banks of streams and in the swamps, I could then readily see that it was perfectly possible for the fish to get out into the corn and cotton fields to feed. The rainy season set in nearly a month earlier this season than usual, causing the rivers and streams to rise so as to flood the whole bottoms (it is called the tide by the people in Alabama). I will not give my views of the country and conditions in northern Alabama--it would not look well; it is sufficient to say that the greater part of the land is owned in large tracts by a few men and leased out at from $3.00 to $4.00 per acre. Corn and Cotton are the main crops. Any land lying above the overflowing sections requires heavy fertilizing in order to make a crop. The fertilizer is the commercial sort, and all the crop will sell for is put onto the land in the way of fertilizers. These lands are mostly leased to colored people--in fact, I was told that the landlords did not care to lease to white men. The poor white man in northern Alabama is worse off than the colored man, for he is looked upon as neither white nor black. In this section the population is largely of the colored class. All of the landlords have a store, so as to furnish their tenants with goods of an inferior quality at exorbitant prices. There is no good water to be found in that part of Alabama. The water that the people use is something fearful--of course the wealthy class have cisterns. The soil is mostly red clay, and terrible to get about in when the least damp. The roads are only names for roads. South of the Tennessee River is what is called the Sand Mountains; the soil is of a sandy nature, freestone water, and the people are all white--in fact, it is said that they will not allow a colored man to live there. I heard it stated that they would not even allow a negro to stop over night in that section. The Sand Mountain region is a piney country with a sandy soil. The land is not as fertile as the bottom lands along the Tennessee River, but they produce a finer grade of cotton, which brings a cent or two a pound more than that of the bottom lands. As to game in north Alabama, there is but little large game to be found. In the extreme northern part of Madison county, well up to the Tennessee line, there are a few deer and wild hogs; it was said that there were some bear, also plenty of wild turkeys. There were plenty of ducks, and a good many quail. There is still some lumbering being done, mostly in oak of different kinds, though a good part is white oak. The logs are cut and hauled to the Tennessee River and taken by steamboat to Decatur in Limestone County, and worked up into lumber and manufactured articles. There is still quite large bodies of cugalo gum left in the swamps, though this timber is not yet used to any great extent. I wish to say that if the trapper expects to ship his camp outfit by freight to any part of the South, he should start it from four to six weeks in advance of the time that he will arrive at the place where he will use it. The trapper, as a usual thing, is too shallow in the region of the pocket book to afford to ship an outfit of camp stove, cooking utensils, tent and a hundred traps or more of various sizes, by express. Of course, he can take his bed blanket and extra clothing as baggage in his trunk. Now to make this matter plainer, I will give my experience of the last two seasons. In 1910 I trapped here in Pennsylvania the first two weeks of November before going south. So shipped my camp chest by express to Cameron, N. C, started it four days before I started so as to be sure that it would be there by the time I arrived. But when I got to Cameron there was no express matter for Woodcock. Five days later while I was standing on the depot platform at Cameron waiting for the eleven o'clock express train, along came a freight train, stopped and put off my camp chest. Now, the express charges on this chest was something over ten dollars on 180 pounds. The next season I concluded that I would not give the express company another rake-off, so started my camp outfit by freight for Madison, Alabama, four weeks before I started, so as to again be sure that it would be there when I arrived. Mr. Ford met me at the station nine miles from his place with a conveyance to take baggage and camp outfit to his place. And boys, imagine my feelings when I was again told by the station agent that there was nothing there for Woodcock. About a week later, I got the goods. So boys, take the hint and start the outfit well ahead if you wish to get it on time. I have had other similar experiences. On our way back to Mr. Ford's place the day he met me at the station, he called my attention to several different places along the road to mink tracks in the ditches and in the road. I thought that it would be no trick at all to take three or four mink each night, but I was not reckoning on the disadvantages I had to contend with. This section of the country is very thickly settled with colored people, and each family keeps from one to three dogs, which are out searching for food all the time. These people never think of feeding their dogs. Nearly every night these colored people are out hunting in droves of five or six, and with six or eight dogs. They think it no more of a crime to steal a trap, and anything found in the trap, than they would consider it a crime to eat a baked 'possum. A trapper must keep a good lookout when setting his traps to see that there is no ""dark object"" anywhere in sight. If there is, you may expect that that particular trap will be missing the next time you come that way. In setting a trap, the first thing to do is to select a place where the trap is to be set, then look carefully around to see that no ""dark object"" is in sight; then go into the bush and get the trap, stake and everything that you will use in making the set. Then you will again look carefully for that ""dark object,"" and will proceed to make the set, provided that yourself is the only human being in sight, stopping your work often to look about you. Do not think that this caution is not necessary, for it sure is. The writer had nine traps taken at one time within an hour after he had been over the line. We went into our first camp, I think, on the 5th of November, at a place called Blackwell's Pond or Blackwell's bottom, I am not sure which. The first day after we got to camp, Mr. Ford went out and put out a few traps, while I stayed in camp and fixed up things. The next morning we went out to look over the ground a little while. Mr. Ford went to the opposite side of the pond to set a few more traps, and see parties who owned land along the pond, for we found that the land had been posted ""No Trespassing."" When Mr. Ford came in that evening I think he brought in five rats. We set nine traps that day and went south along the pond to look over the grounds. The next morning we had one mink and one coon in the nine traps. I think Mr. Ford brought in four rats and had one coon foot. That evening Mr. Ford went home to raise his nets, and when he came back he brought in two mink; I got two coon. Mr. Ford went home again and made arrangements for a team to come in and move us out to ""pastures new."" He also brought another mink, and I believe that we got two or three coons that night. I think we got nine rats, four mink and eight coons in the three nights with about twenty traps. The land about this pond had been leased by Mr. Edmon Toney, a wealthy young man living near the place. While Mr. Toney is wealthy, he insists in indulging in the meek and lowly occupation of the trapper. We know Mr. Toney to be a successful trapper, for he caught, while we were in camp at that place, one of the wealthiest and most beautiful young ladies in that section. Mr. Toney is a reader of the H-T-T. Our next camp was on Little Indian creek, at the edge of a large cugalo swamp not the pleasantest place that one could wish for a camp. [Illustration: E. N. WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS ALABAMA FURS.] The next day after we went into Camp No. 2. I set a few traps near camp. Mr. Ford went down the creek toward his place and set a few traps, and went home to look after his fish nets, returning to camp that evening. Mr. Ford had warned me that the mink in that section would foot themselves equally as bad as muskrats, but as I had never been bothered with mink footing themselves, I paid no attention to his warning. The next morning Mr. Ford stepped outside of the tent--it was about five o'clock and called to me, asking where I had set my first trap on the creek, and being told, he replied, ""Well, you have caught a mink."" When asked how he knew, he said, ""Come out and hear him squall."" I ate breakfast and hastened down to release the mink, but my haste was unnecessary for the mink did not propose to wait for me, I found only the mink's foot--the mink had gone. I had never had a mink foot itself in this way before and did not think that the mink did, although here in Alabama, we had two mink to foot themselves in one night. Had I heeded Mr. Ford's warning, I would have been several mink pelts ahead. While there was considerable fur to be found in the vicinity of Camp No. 2, it was a hard place to camp, owing to the scarcity of camp wood and the inconvenience of getting water, so we moved on to Beaver Dam creek, in Limestone county, where we were in hopes of finding a few beaver and quite a plenty of mink and coon. But we were sadly disappointed; we found but little to trap, but found trappers and trap-lifters in abundance, so made haste to get out of that country while we had our boats left. Our catch was only two mink, twelve rats, five coon and one or two 'possum. We moved from this place back into Madison County and pitched our camp at a point known as the Sinks, where we did a better business. But the rainy season soon set in, so we were compelled to break camp and get out, leaving a good part of our traps where we had set them, now under several feet of water. We shall never see them again. Well boys, you will excuse me from telling just how many coon we got in an hour and seven minutes. I can only state that during the five weeks that Mr. Ford and the writer were in camp that we got twenty-six mink. I do not remember the number of coons, opossums and rats caught. CHAPTER XXXIII. Some Early Experiences. Comrades of the trap line and trail, as I have gotten too old, March 1913, and too nigh played out to longer get far out into the tall timber, I will, with the consent of the editor of the H-T-T, relate some of my experiences on the trap line and trail of some years ago. A young man by the name of Frank Wright was hunting and trapping on the Crossfork waters of Kettle Creek. Frank was a young man barely out of his teens, and had been in the woods but little, but Frank was a hustler and was not afraid of the screech of the owl; the days were altogether too short for him. We went into camp early in October as we had to do a good deal of repairing on the camp as the cabin had not been used in two or three years, and the porcupines got in their work in good shape. The cabin was built of logs and the ""porces"" had gnawed nearly all of the chinking out from between the logs and the mud was all gone from around the chinking. Some of the shakes were gone from the roof and the door which was made of split shakes. First, we split out shakes and repaired the roof and the door. We then split chinking block out of a basswood tree to renew the chinkings that had been gnawed and eaten up by the porcupines. After the chinking was all replaced and fastened in place by making wedges and driving them into the logs, one at each end of each chinking block, we gathered moss from old logs and calked every crack, pressing the moss into the cracks with a wedge-shape stick made for the purpose. The calking was all done from the inside. After the chinking and calking was done, we dug into a clay bank and got clay, which we mixed with ashes taken from the fire then added sufficient water to make a rather stiff mortar. We filled the spaces between the logs, going over every crack on the outside of the shack. Now and again Frank would notice a mink or coon track along the creek, while he was gathering moss from the old logs. These tracks would drive Frank nearly wild, and he would double his energy so as to get the shack finished so we could hit the trap line. After we got the shack in good shape, we went to work getting up a good supply of wood, sufficient to last through the season. We had an open fireplace, so we cut the wood about three feet long. The wood was now up near the camp door, ranked up in good snug piles. We then cut crotched stakes and drove them in the ground on each side of the ranks, and laid poles in, then placed cross poles on and covered with hemlock boughs. Frank was so anxious to get to work on the trap line, that he at first objected to putting in so much time in getting up the wood, saying that we could get the wood at odd times. But when told that there are no odd times on the trap line, he then worked the harder to get the supply of wood, including a good supply of dry pine for kindling fires, which we got by cutting a dry pine stub. The camp now being in good shape, we hit the trap line and began building deadfalls for marten. We went onto the ridges into the thick heavy timber, where the marten were most likely to be found. We would select a low hemlock to build the deadfalls under, so the trap would be protected from heavy falls of snow, as much as possible. Some of the traps we would drive crotched stakes and lay poles in them and then cover with hemlock boughs to keep the snow off. After we had several lines of marten traps built, we went onto the stream and branches and built deadfalls for mink and coon. Nearly every day we saw deer, but the weather was still too warm to keep venison any length of time, so we did not carry our guns with us. When Frank would see a deer he would make grave threats that he would carry his gun the next day. We were about two miles from the stage road. The stage made only one trip a week, so there was no way of disposing of a deer as long as the weather was so warm. It took but little persuasion to convince Frank that it would be poor policy to kill deer as long as we could make use of but a small part of a single deer. After we had gotten out a good line of deadfalls for marten, mink and coon, and as it was now about the first of November and time to bait up the deadfalls, and set out what steel traps we had for fox, I told Frank that we would carry our guns with us and try to kill a deer for bait and camp use. Frank could hardly sleep that night; he was so delighted to think that the time had come to quit the monkey business, as he called it, and begin business. We climbed the ridge where we knew there were some deer, following down the ridge, one on each side, along the brow of the hill. We put in the entire day without getting a shot at a deer. That night it snowed about an inch, so that in the wooded timber, one could see the trail of the deer in the snow; but in hemlock timber there was not enough snow on the ground, so a track could be followed. We had killed a squirrel or two, and had a little prepared bait, so we concluded to bait a few traps until we struck a deer trail. We did not succeed in finding the tracks of any deer until well along in the afternoon. It so happened that I got a shot at a deer that was nearly hidden from sight behind a large tree. I shot the deer through, just forward of the hips. We followed it only a short distance when we found the bed of the deer, and there was blood in it, so it was plain to be seen in what manner the deer was wounded. All still-hunters (excuse the word still-hunt; the word stalking does not sound good to a backwoodsman) of deer know that when a deer is shot well back through the small intestines, that if conditions will allow, the right thing to do is to leave the trail for a time and the deer will lie down. If left alone for an hour or two the hunter will have but little trouble in getting his deer. So in this case, as we were not far from camp and it was nearly sundown, I told Frank that we had better let the deer go until morning, when we would have more daylight ahead of us, and we would get the deer with less trouble. We started for camp and had gone only a short distance when Frank said he would work along the ridge a little and see if he could not kill a partridge. [Illustration: FOOT OF TREE SET.] I went on to camp and when dark came I couldn't see nor hear anything of Frank. I ate my supper, and as I could get no word from Frank either by shouting or firing my gun, I climbed to the top of the ridge so I could be heard for a greater distance, but still I could get no answer. It had turned warmer and what little snow was on the ground had melted. I could not follow his trail in the dark, so went back to camp and built a good big fire outside of the camp in case Frank should come in sight, he might see the light and come in. At intervals of half an hour, I would call as loud as I could. I kept this up until midnight, when I lay down to get a little sleep, knowing that I could not help matters by staying up. At daylight the next morning I was on the ridge at the place where I last saw Frank, and by close watch managed to follow his trail while he was in the hardwood timber, where there was a heavy fall of leaves; but when he struck into the heavy hemlock timber, I could no longer track him. However, I had tracked him sufficiently far enough to see that he had gone back to look for the wounded deer. I made tracks in the direction I expected the wounded deer would be likely to lie down. After some searching I found the bed of the deer, also tracks of a man, which I knew to be Frank. But I could only follow the trail a short distance from where he had driven the deer out of its bed. There were plenty of deer tracks all around, but knowing that the wounded deer would naturally work down the draw, I worked my way along the hollow, keeping a close lookout for any signs of the wounded deer that I might chance to cross. At different times, I found a few drops of blood, but no signs of Frank. I had worked down the hollow some ways, when I ran onto the wounded deer; it staggered to its feet, but was too near gone to keep its feet. I finished it by shooting it in its head. I removed the entrails as quickly as I could, bent down a sapling and hung the deer up, and then made tracks down the stream the best I could shouting and occasionally firing off my gun. We were in a big wilderness. No roads or inhabitants west of us for many miles, and this was the course I feared Frank was most likely to take. I now began to think that I had a serious job on hands. I kept up the search all day without getting the least trace of Frank and returned to camp late that night. Starting early the next morning, and taking a good lunch with me, I crossed the head of Winfall Run and over the divide onto the waters of the Hamersley, continuing to shout and occasionally firing my gun. I had worked down the run some six or eight miles, when I heard some one hollow two or three times in quick succession. I was quite positive it was Frank. It was miles from any inhabitants in a dense wilderness, and hunters were not common on those parts in those days. I immediately answered the call, and soon I could hear Frank coming down the hill at breakneck speed, giving tongue at every jump. We at once started for camp, Frank eating the lunch I had brought in my knapsack, and telling of his trials, as we made tracks the best we were able to for camp. Frank, in telling his story, would cry like a baby, and then laugh like a boy with a pair of new boots. But he cut no more boy tricks. We finished the season's hunt, catching a goodly bunch of fox, marten, mink and coon, as well as killing a good bunch of deer. Had fur and venison brought as much in those days, as at the present time, we would have bought an automobile, and put an end to this hoofing it. CHAPTER XXXIV. The White Deer. I do not remember whether I have told the boys of the H-T-T the story of the white deer, which I had the good luck to get, and the picture of which was shown in one of the sporting magazines a few years ago. The picture was sent to the magazine by Mrs. Prudence Boyington, Roulett, Pa., who was the owner of the deer at the time, and I believe a daughter of Mrs. Boyington still has the deer. It was in the spring of 1878 or 1879 that a doe and a white fawn were seen on the hill just south of Lymansville. The fawn and its mother were seen almost daily in some of the fields near the village, and often were seen in some one of the pastures with the cows. The fawn would run and play about like a lamb. It was plain to be seen from week to week that the fawn was rapidly growing, and as the open season for hunting of deer drew near it was generally understood that the white fawn and its mother should not be killed. When the winter came on, the fawn and its mother were all at once missing. The general supposition was that they had been killed, but when spring came the doe and the white fawn (now a yearling deer) again appeared on its old haunts of the year before. They had merely gone back into the more dense woods to winter. Along in June it was noticed that there were three deer instead of two. Another fawn had appeared on the scene, this time an ordinary spotted fawn. They were again daily seen during the summer the same as they were the year before. Now it had been strongly urged by the people all about the country that these deer should not be killed, and there was none that was more strongly in favor of this than I was. The deer were regularly seen again all summer and up to the last days of October, when they again disappeared and all were anxious for spring to come to see if they would return as usual. When spring came the deer came back as before, but in June ""the whole bunch came up missing,"" and it was generally thought that they had changed their haunts or they had been killed. The latter was strongly suspected. I had taken a scout through the woods on the hills back of the locality where these deer had been frequenting and had seen signs that convinced me that the white deer, at least, was still alive, although it had not been seen for a number of weeks. Here I wish to explain that Coudersport is two miles from Lymansville and it is on the hill between the two places that the white deer had been seen most, and it was in the former place that the loudest cry for the protection of this white deer came from. Now about this time I had killed a deer in the big woods where several of us had been on a fishing trip and I took a piece of this venison to a friend in town. It so happened that one of the side judges of our court (Stebens by name) was at the house of my friend. A few days later I was in a store belonging to a brother of the Judge, when the Judge came in and accused me of killing the white deer. Of course I denied, and told the Judge that I would wager two dollars that the white deer was still living. The Judge said ""Very well,"" and at the same time handed a two dollar bill to a man standing by, by the name of Abison, who was listening to our conversation, which was quite heated. I told the Judge at the very first opportunity I would kill the white deer. The white deer was not seen in the woods any more, and I was charged with killing it. I said nothing in regard to the charge, for I had now made up my mind to kill it if I could. One day three or four weeks after I had made the wager, Mr. Abison came to me and handed me two dollars and said that the Judge had got his money and told him to give me my money back as he (the Judge) did not want to take the money, that I had killed the white deer all right. Now I was quite positive that the Judge had learned that the white deer was still alive. I had heard that the white deer had again been seen in a field near town. Now this made me all the more determined to kill the white deer. I will explain that I had learned that several of the sportsmen of Coudersport, the Judge included, had had dogs after the white deer several times the previous fall, but it so happened that there were no watchers at the place where the deer came to the creek. That fall as soon as the first snow fell I went after the deer. I did not strike the trail until quite late in the afternoon, and as the deer left the woods where it had been accustomed to staying and went into the big woods farther south, I left the trail for that day. I would have got a shot at the deer if my attention had not been called in the wrong direction by the chirping of several blue jays which I thought were excited over the presence of the white deer. I was working the trail to the best of my ability and knew that I was close to the game, when my attention was drawn by the chirping of those blue jays which were down the side of a hill. I was working the trail so as to be on vantage ground and could see from where I was standing that the trail had turned slightly down the hill along the side of a fallen tree and in the direction of the chirping of the jays. This led me to think that the jays were scolding the deer, so I cautiously advanced a few steps down the hill, expecting every moment to see the deer. While I was watching down the hill, I heard a slight noise to my right and partly behind me. I looked in the direction in which the noise came from and was surprised to catch a glimpse of the deer jumping the log near where I had last seen the trail. The log hid the deer from my sight so that I was unable to get a shot at it. The deer had lain down close to the log, and had I taken a few more steps in the direction I was going instead of giving attention to the jays I would have seen the deer and made my word good the first time. It was too late in the day to follow the trail farther at this time, knowing that the deer would run a long distance before stopping. As I had a team engaged to take me to my camp and I was anxious to get there on the first tracking snow, I concluded to give the white deer a rest a few days until I returned from camp in the big woods. I was in camp only a few days when the snow went off, so I came home. I had only been home a day or two when a man by the name of Hill came to my house in great haste. He had been cutting logs en a hill, and looking across onto a hill opposite where he was working, saw the white deer, so came to tell we what he had seen. I at once took my gun and started after the deer. I went up the hill in the direction that Mr. Hill had seen the deer until I was quite sure that I was well above the deer, then cautiously worked my way down the side of that hill. There being no snow on the ground and the deer being white, I soon discovered it lying in its bed. I cautiously crept up within shooting distance and fired, killing the deer instantly. I will explain how it happened that these deer disappeared so suddenly at the time Judge Stebens accused me of killing the white deer and the wager was made between the Judge and your humble servant. A man by the name of Frank Williams had shot the deer breaking a foreleg at the knee joint, and this caused the deer to remain hidden away until it recovered from the wound. The leg or joint was stiff when the deer was killed and the force of the bullet was so spent that it lay against the skin after shattering the knee joint and I still have the ball which I took from the knee. I had the deer mounted and Mrs. Boyington took it as she was collecting freaks and curios of this country. CHAPTER XXXV. A Day of Luck. Every hunter of long experience could tell of the ups and downs along the trail consisting of good, bad and indifferent luck and as usual tell of our hits and let others tell of our misses, I will tell of a day of good luck. It was in November and there was no snow on the ground. I was camping on the Holman branch of Pine Creek in Pennsylvania and one night, just at dark, a party of several men came to my camp and asked to stay over night. They stated that they were going to camp on the opposite side of the ridge on the Sinnamahoning waters. My camp was small but I made room for the hunters the best I could. This party was going into a section of country where I had several bear traps as well as a good number of smaller traps set for fox, mink, marten and other fur animals. As I wished to look these traps over the next day before this party got scattered about the woods where my traps were, I got up early the next morning, ate a hasty breakfast and put a lunch into my knapsack and was ready to start out before the party of hunters was up. I cautioned the hunters to see that the fire was safe when they left camp and then started on my day's hunt without the slightest idea that I was starting on one of the luckiest days I ever had. I had to climb a high ridge, then my route was for some distance on a long ridge, which I would follow for a distance of a mile and a half, when I dropped off the right hand side of the ridge into a ravine where I had a bear trap set. This ridge was a clean open one of beech and maple timber. I knew it would keep me busy the entire day to get over the trap line, the best that I could do, so had no intention of spending any time looking after deer. When I got to this open ridge, I took a dog trot along the ridge. I was making good time when on looking ahead along the ridge I saw a good-sized buck come from the left hand side of the ridge. He would take a jump or two then drop his head to the ground and then take another hop or two and again drop his head to the ground. I knew that he was on the trail of other deer. I had hardly time to bring my gun to my shoulder when the buck wheeled and disappeared back over the ridge from where he had come. I started on a run to where the deer had gone out of sight, thinking that possibly I might catch him before he got out of range down the side of the hill. Imagine my surprise when just as I reached the top of the hill, where I saw the deer disappear from my sight, I almost ran against the buck. He had turned back to cross the ridge when I met him. He whirled down the hill but I was too close onto him and I caught him before he could get out of reach. I took out the deer's entrails and bent down a sapling and hung the deer up, then I crossed the ridge and started down the ravine to look after the bear traps. I was hurrying down the hill near a jam of fallen timber, when all at once out jumped five or six deer from this timber. In an instant the whole bunch was out of sight behind the jam with the exception of one large doe. I could see, one of her hips standing out from behind a large hemlock tree. Without hesitating a moment, I fired at what I could see of the deer and it dropped out of sight as the gun cracked. I hurried through the jam of timber to where I saw the deer and there the doe lay, trying to get on her feet. I soon ended her misery by shooting her in the head. I soon had her entrails out and hung up as I had the buck. It was the trail of this bunch of deer that the buck was on when he ran into me. After I had hung up the deer I hustled on down the ravine to the bear trap. When I got to the place where the trap was set it was gone. The trail led down the ravine and was easy to follow as I hurried along and I soon found a small bear tangled up in a thicket of small brush. It was only the work of a moment to fix bruin in shape to skin. After I had the hide off, I cut the bear up into quarters and hung the meat up in the trees. I toted the trap back up to where it was set and reset it then I went back down the hollow to where I had left the bear skin and took it on my shoulder and made tracks down the hollow to the main creek where I had a string of deadfalls set for mink and coon. The bear skin was about all the load I cared to tote, but I had not gone far down the creek before I had the skins of two good sized coon and one mink tied to my load. The coon and mink skins I could get in my knapsack so they did not bother much. After following the creek a distance of about one mile I left the creek and went up a long narrow sawtooth point to cross the divide to the Cross Fork waters where I had some bear, fox and marten traps set. When I was about two-thirds of the way up this point I stopped at the side of a large rock which would shelter me from the cold wind. The point was covered with low laurel. I had been watching down the side of the hill to see if I could not catch sight of some animal on the move, but I had not got a glimpse of even a squirrel. I had about finished my lunch, when I saw the motion of something move in the laurel, forty or fifty yards below me. I picked up my gun and stood watching, when I again caught sight of the animal and in a moment I saw the horns of a deer. I could get the outline of the deer's body so I said, ""Now or never,"" and let go the best I could at the bunch, but when the smoke from the gun was gone, I could neither see nor hear anything but stood ready with my gun to my shoulder. I again saw a part of a deer move in an open space in the laurel. I again fired at the bunch with the remark that I guessed that I could drive him out of there after a while. I left the bear skin and knapsack at the rock, knowing that the rock would be a good landmark to find them by and went down through the laurel to see what effect my shot had. When I got to where the deer were, when I shot, I readily saw plenty of blood on the green laurel leaves and I only had a few steps to go when I saw the buck lying dead. I cut his throat and stood waiting for the blood to stop flowing and saw a trail that was fresh. I could readily tell by the way the leaves and ground were torn up that the trail was of some animal that was having a hard time to keep on its feet. You can imagine my joy and surprise to get two deer so unexpectedly. I had only a few rods to go when I found a good big doe dead. Well, you may guess that I lost no time in getting the entrails out of these two deer and swinging them up as I had the other two for it was getting well past noon. I would be a good five miles from camp when I got to my first marten trap. After I got to the top of the divide, I made the best time that was in me. I looked at several fox and marten traps but none had been disturbed. When I got to the first bear trap on the divide I had an occasion to scold and scold hard, but all to no purpose. I found the limb of a tree jammed in between the jaws of the trap. Of course, I thought some hunter had done me the favor and having as hard a stunt ahead of me, you can guess that the trick was not pleasing to me. Well, here I learned how foolish it was to fly off the handle before you know what has been doing. Now, after a little investigation, I found that the limb had been broken from the tree by the wind and it so happened that it fell right onto the pan of the trap and sprang it. Setting the trap, I hurried on to the next bear trap and here I had another chance to be disgusted, even more than in the first case. This time it was a porcupine in the trap but there was nothing to be done, only reset the trap and hurry on again. None of the other traps were disturbed, neither the small traps nor the bear trap until I came to the last marten trap which had a marten in it. It was now too dark to see to skin it so I was obliged to dump the carcass into the knapsack and tote it along with the coons and mink pelts. I had about one mile to go to reach the road, then four miles to camp and I often thought what a hunter and a trapper would endure and call it sport. It must have been nearly nine o'clock when I got to camp, where I still found the hunting party. They had taken a part of their outfit to their camp grounds and had worked on their camp until nearly night when they returned to my camp to stay for the night and get the balance of their outfit. Well, I was pleased to find them still in camp for they volunteered to go with me the next day and help me get the deer and bear out to the road in return for venison and bear meat. This ended one of the luckiest and hardest day's work that I ever did on the trail or trap line. CHAPTER XXXVI. A Mixed Bag. I promised some of my old trapper friends back East, that I would let them, who were fortunate enough to be subscribers to the H-T-T, hear from me. I will say that this is a mountain region of the first magnitude. A man that cannot mount a donkey and ride over a trail where the river is hundreds of feet below, or as it looks to be nearly under him, and the trail not more than twelve inches wide, hewn out of the solid rock, he had best remain in the East. This is a sportsman's paradise, and the trapper will find here prey in the way of bear, both black and brown, fisher, mink, raccoon, fox, otter, panther, or as the natives call them, mountain lion, wildcat, skunk, civet cat and many other fur bearing animals and all quite numerous. Deer seem to be very abundant. I counted thirteen in a lick this morning, and it is not an uncommon thing to see from ten to twenty in the licks at one time. The fishing is said to be the best in the spring and fall. It is not an uncommon thing to catch salmon, weighing from six to thirty-five pounds, and as it is only thirty-five miles to the Pacific Ocean, they are of the very best quality. Mountain trout are plentiful. Another animal that is plenty is the mountain goat. Bear, mountain lion, and other signs are as numerous as those of rabbits in the East. I am not prepared at this time, to say how shrewd these animals are to trap, but if they take bait as readily as they are reported to, they must not be very hard to catch. There is a bounty of $4.00 on wolves and the writer has seen numerous signs of them. Will say to my friends in the East that while on my way from the coast to the ranch, a distance of only fifty miles, and the most of the way over mountain trails, I stopped often to watch the deer feeding along the side of the trail. When they saw you they would trot off a short distance and begin feeding again. Only last evening, Mrs. Evie Newell, shot and killed a large mountain lion that started into the yard after a pig. It seems to me panthers are thicker here than wildcats in Pennsylvania. * * * I have experimented with scents for years and have found scents of no particular benefit for trapping the fox. I have tried the skunk and muskrat scent, the matrix of the female fox taken at the proper time. I have had a female fox and have lead her to my trapping place, and I have tried many so-called fox scents and all to no purpose. Fox urine may, in some particular places, be used to some slight advantage. It is not so with other animals in regard to scents, for they do not use the same acute instinct that the fox does. I do not wish to insinuate upon those that do use scent, but for me, I would not give a cent for a barrel of so-called fox decoy. I boil my traps in soft maple bark, hemlock boughs or something of that nature. I do not do this because the fox can be any more readily got into the trap, but because it forms a glazing on the trap and thereby prevents them from rusting and the trap will then spring more readily. It makes no difference how rusty the trap is, so far as catching the fox is concerned. No boys, no scent for me, the fox soon learns to associate the scent business with the man, then you are up against it. With me there is nothing mysterious about trapping. It is simply practical ways of setting the trap, learned from many years of experience. * * * I have had fifty years experience as a hunter and trapper. I have netted wild pigeons in the Adirondack Mountains, in New York, to the Indian Territory, so you know that the articles in H-T-T are very interesting to me. I would say that no young trapper should be without this journal, although I would advise them not to take too readily to scents and decoys. As to the discussions that have been in H-T-T, one writer says he has twenty ways to catch the fox; now I have just as many different ways as there are different conditions. I would say that no one can become a successful trapper until he learns to comply with the natural conditions, which will differ with almost every trap he sets when trapping fox, mink, etc. I will tell my brother trappers what I have been doing this fall (1902) along the line of trapping. In August I took a trip through portions of Montana, Idaho and Washington, to look up a site to do a little trapping this winter. There is much more game here than in the East, but nothing like you hear talked of. I found the mountains too steep and the underbrush too thick and from what I could learn, I was afraid the weather was too cold for one of my age and condition of health, but, oh boys, what trout fishing I found in the Clearwater; this is a branch of Snake River and empties into that river at Lewiston, Idaho. As I found things, I thought I would return to old Potter County, Pennsylvania, and have a little fun trapping the fox and skunk as that is about the only game there is in this section when we have no beechnuts, for that is the only mast we have here. We have no beechnuts this season and most of the fur bearing animals have migrated south of here where there are chestnuts, acorns and hickory nuts. Brothers, I will tell you where my camp is, and you will always find the latch-string out. My camp stands at the very head of the Allegheny River, 1700 feet above sea level. From the cabin door you could throw a stone over the divide to where the water flows into the west branch of the Susquehanna. In a half hour a person can, from my camp, catch trout from the waters of the Allegheny, and the Susquehanna. As we have no beechnuts we have no bears, so I have not set my bear traps. This will cut my sport considerably short. I have put out but about sixty small traps, so I spend my time about equally between camp and home. I will send a picture of myself and my old dog Mage, who I believe knows more about trapping than some families. But poor old Mage is 13 years old and is following the down trail very rapidly. He is quite deaf and gets around with difficulty. Poor fellow, he is nearly to the end of the trail. [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS OLD TRAPPING DOG--MAGE. THE BEST TRAPPING DOG THAT EVER TROD THE EARTH.] The furs shown in the picture are my first four days' catch with forty traps: 9 fox, 2 coon, 1 mink and 7 skunk. My catch to date, November 25, in thirteen days is 14 fox, 27 skunk, 9 coon and 1 mink. * * * Brothers, I will give some reasons why I do not write more of my experience as a trapper. First, I am not much given to writing. Second, my experiences in trapping are so different from so many trappers who write, that I thought it best to say but little or nothing about trapping. I could call myself, ""Old Honesty,"" and then write or cause it to be written and published in some of the sporting papers, that I had caught 300 fox this season, as I see one trapper did, but I would not feel good about it after I had done so. Fifty-seven fox are the most that I ever caught in one season. A brother was down to see me and I was pleased to meet him, I wish to say, brother trappers, that if you should have an opportunity to meet Brother Stearns, you will find him a gentleman in every respect. But, Brother Stearns and I could not agree on the scent question, and he did not like to believe that I handled my traps, bait and all pertaining to the setting of the trap, bare-handed. He went so far as to hint that I was cold-blooded, and even felt of my pulse to see if my circulation was all right. Hold on, I am mistaken, it was my hands that he felt of to see if they were not cold, but he pronounced them all right. He then related a story about an old uncle of his and a crow, but shook his head and said it did not do any harm to wear gloves if it did not do any good. That is all right, but we do not like to be carrying unnecessary weight. One word with Brother Chas. T. Wells. No, brother, I do not go much on scents. Perhaps you would have caught more than 15 fox, but I do not like to own that you could have done so. Now the first ten days that I was in the woods, there were hundreds of head of cattle in the woods, and the woods were full of men gathering them up, and one could do but little or nothing in the way of trapping. Neither did the 15 include the five that were stolen, nor the two that broke the chains and went off with the trap. By the way, Brother Stearns could tell you of a chase I had with one of those that carried off a trap, the worst jaunt I have had in many a day. No brother, the only scent I use is the urine of the fox and I only use that in certain places. No, I believe that one good method is much better than scents in trapping the fox. If one wishes to use scents, they will find none better than some of those advertised in the H-T-T. Now brothers, while I do not believe that any one man is so cute he cannot find his equal, I do not like to believe but that I can catch as many fox as the next one--all things being equal. For the last ten years I have not set traps over a scope of territory to exceed two or three miles square and if Brother Stearns had been on the ground that I trapped on, a few days before I began trapping, he would have seen but few fox signs. I usually trap on a different piece of ground each year. I know of some trappers here that begin trapping the first of September and they are good trappers too, but they are so greedy, they are willing to kill the ""goose that lays the golden egg."" * * * Several years ago, through the courtesy of Mr. John Shawl, one of the Tide Water Pipe Line Co's telegraph operators, I was allowed the use of one of their offices for camping purposes during the trapping season. Now, do not think that this office was located in a town, for it was not. On the contrary, it was located in the largest wooded section of this locality, and on the old Jersey Shore Turnpike. There was a path or sort of a woods road at the point where this office was located, leading from this road to another road, a distance of more than four miles and making a cut off for people who wished to go on to the waters of the Sinnamahoning or Kettel Creek in Northern Pennsylvania. It was customary for me to stay in camp for a week or ten days and then go home and stay two or three days. One day on returning from one of my trips home, I had rather better luck than coming, getting 5 fox, 3 coon and 1 wildcat. I usually hung my furs on the side of the building close up under the eaves until I went home, then I would take them home on the following morning of the day I had caught them. There was a rap at the door about five o'clock in the morning and on going to the door, I found two men with a lantern; one man of middle age, the other a young man. There had just been a fall of snow of about four inches, and the men were going onto the Cross Fork of Kettel Creek, deer hunting. They had stayed at a farm house on the other road and had started from this house between three and four o'clock in the morning. Seeing a light in the office, they thought they would come in and stay until daylight. The old gentleman inquired what I was doing there. I informed him that I was trying to trap a little. He said that he should not think it would pay me, but if I could catch a fox it would be different, as he had seen several tracks along the road by the light of the lantern. He also told me that he had a recipe for making fox scent, that was a dead sure thing, and as I lived so far from his place, I would not be liable to interfere with his trapping, he would knock off one-half his usual price and sell me a recipe for five dollars. I said I would see what luck I had while they were gone, and it might be possible that I would buy his recipe when he came back. He said, delays were dangerous, and that I was losing the greatest opportunity of my life, that he might not come back that way. I thanked him, but told him I would chance it. It was now daylight, and as the hunters stepped outside they noticed the carcass of a wildcat, and I told them if they would step to the corner of the building, they would see what I got yesterday. They did so, and gazed for one second at the pelts, then the older of the two said, ""Come, Charley, let's be going,"" and they left without even bidding me good morning. Comrades you do not know how I enjoy your letters as given in this splendid magazine, especially so this winter (season of 1905-6) as I have not been able to trap. But I have no kick coming for this is only the third time in fifty years, but what I have been able to be out with the traps and gun. I know that the readers of the H-T-T would be pleased to read articles from old veterans. The H-T-T has about reached the height of perfection so far as the trapper is concerned. There is none of the high top boot, fashionable, corduroy suits and checkered cap business about the H-T-T. Success to all. * * * Boys, you know how we all like to gather around a camp fire and talk over our hunting and trapping experiences, of how we caught a certain mink, fox, coon or bear, or how we killed a certain deer. So while we are out fishing I thought I would like to have a chat with the trappers. And boys, all you who have not camped out for a week and had a good time fishing, do not know how much you have lost, especially those who need the care of a doctor. Yes, boys, take your camp outfit and go out into the woods among the hills, streams and lakes. There you will find one of the most competent doctors and nurses that ever treated the ills of human family. Do not forget to take a few copies of the HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER along and other sporting magazines, as well as some of the Harding Library, so while you are resting in camp you can visit with the trapper boys all over the Union. This is May 20, 1905, and the second time I have been out camping and fishing this spring. Trout are not as plentiful as they were forty years ago by a great deal, but we still get all we can use, and that is plenty. While you are out fishing do not forget to keep a lookout for signs of game you will be trapping next winter. You may see where there has been a litter of young mink, fox or coon reared. While these animals are of migratory nature, they will, nevertheless, visit their old homes frequently, so you will find these places a pretty sure place to make a catch next fall when you put our your traps. Do not forget that during the summer is just the time to fix some of your best sets for fox and other fur bearing animals. As I have had many years experience in camping, let me say to those who have never camped, and who expect to camp the coming season, that now is the time to hunt up a partner and get acquainted. I have camped many seasons in large woods both with and without partners.

General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

It is an imperative duty, because it must be performed at once, for otherwise it will be too late. Every possible means of preservation,--sentimental, educational and legislative,--must be employed. The present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this great battle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones, nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense of beauty, or enjoyment of Nature. It is necessary to sound a loud alarm, to present the facts in very strong language, backed up by irrefutable statistics and by photographs which tell no lies, to establish the law and enforce it if needs be with a bludgeon. This book is such an alarm call. Its forceful pages remind me of the sounding of the great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of the Middle Ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their homes, their liberties and their happiness. It is undeniable that the welfare and happiness of our own and of all future generations of Americans are at stake in this battle for the preservation of Nature against the selfishness, the ignorance, or the cruelty of her destroyers. We no longer destroy great works of art. They are treasured, and regarded as of priceless value; but we have yet to attain the state of civilization where the destruction of a glorious work of Nature, whether it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird, is regarded with equal abhorrence. The whole earth is a poorer place to live in when a colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is destroyed in order that the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion, and ultimately find their way into the rubbish heap. The people of all the New England States are poorer when the ignorant whites, foreigners, or negroes of our southern states destroy the robins and other song birds of the North for a mess of pottage. Travels through Europe, as well as over a large part of the North American continent, have convinced me that nowhere is Nature being destroyed so rapidly as in the United States. Except within our conservation areas, an earthly paradise is being turned into an earthly hades; and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing this, but men and women who boast of their civilization. Air and water are polluted, rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping grounds, forests are swept away and fishes are driven from the streams. Many birds are becoming extinct, and certain mammals are on the verge of extermination. Vulgar advertisements hide the landscape, and in all that disfigures the wonderful heritage of the beauty of Nature to-day, we Americans are in the lead. Fortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing, and the tide of conservation is coming in. Americans are practical. Like all other northern peoples, they love money and will sacrifice much for it, but they are also full of idealism, as well as of moral and spiritual energy. The influence of the splendid body of Americans and Canadians who have turned their best forces of mind and language into literature and into political power for the conservation movement, is becoming stronger every day. Yet we are far from the point where the momentum of conservation is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide of destruction; and this is especially true with regard to our fast vanishing animal life. The facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all those lovers of Nature and friends of the animal world who are living in a false or imaginary sense of security. The logic of these facts is inexorable. As regards our birds and mammals, the failures of supposed protection in America--under a system of free shooting--are so glaring that we are confident this exposure will lead to sweeping reforms. The author of this work is no amateur in the field of wild-life protection. His ideas concerning methods of reform are drawn from long and successful experience. The states which are still behind in this movement may well give serious heed to his summons, and pass the new laws that are so urgently demanded to save the vanishing remnant. The New York Zoological Society, which is cooperating with many other organizations in this great movement, sends forth this work in the belief that there is no one who is more ardently devoted to the great cause or rendering more effective service in it than William T. Hornaday. We believe that this is a great book, destined to exert a world-wide influence, to be translated into other languages, and to arouse the defenders and lovers of our vanishing animal life before it is too late. HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN, 10 December, 1912. _President of the New York Zoological Society_ * * * * * PREFACE The writing of this book has taught me many things. Beyond question, we are exterminating our finest species of mammals, birds and fishes _according to law!_ I am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the entire United States and Canada, in every state and province, the existing legal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally defective. There is not a single state in our country from which the killable game is not being rapidly and persistently shot to death, legally or illegally, very much more rapidly than it is breeding, with extermination for the most of it close in sight. This statement is not open to argument; for millions of men know that it is literally true. We are living in a fool's paradise. The rage for wild-life slaughter is far more prevalent to-day throughout the world than it was in 1872, when the buffalo butchers paved the prairies of Texas and Colorado with festering carcasses. From one end of our continent to the other, there is a restless, resistless desire to ""kill, _kill!_"" I have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that all over our country and Canada fully nine-tenths of our protective laws have practically been dictated by the killers of the game, and that in all save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly careful to provide ""open seasons"" for slaughter, as long as any game remains to kill! _And yet, the game of North America does not belong wholly and exclusively to the men who kill! The other ninety-seven per cent of the People have vested rights in it, far exceeding those of the three per cent. Posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can ignore._ I am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do not kill wild things to awake, and do their plain duty in protecting and preserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to us, but chiefly to those who come after us. Can they be aroused, before it is too late? The time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding ""bag limits"" and different ""open seasons"" as being sufficient to preserve the game, has gone by! We have reached the point where the alternatives are _long closed seasons or a gameless continent;_ and we must choose one or the other, speedily. A continent without wild life is like a forest with no leaves on the trees. The great increase in the slaughter of song birds for food, by the negroes and poor whites of the South, has become an unbearable scourge to our migratory birds,--the very birds on which farmers north and south depend for protection from the insect hordes,--the very birds that are most near and dear to the people of the North. _Song-bird slaughter is growing and spreading_, with the decrease of the game birds! It is a matter that requires instant attention and stern repression. At the present moment it seems that the only remedy lies in federal protection for all migratory birds,--because so many states will not do their duty. We are weary of witnessing the greed, selfishness and cruelty of ""civilized"" man toward the wild creatures of the earth. We are sick of tales of slaughter and pictures of carnage. It is time for a sweeping Reformation; and that is precisely what we now demand. I have been a sportsman myself; but times have changed, and we must change also. When game was plentiful, I believed that it was right for men and boys to kill a limited amount of it for sport and for the table. But the old basis has been swept away by an Army of Destruction that now is almost beyond all control. We must awake, and arouse to the new situation, face it like men, and adjust our minds to the new conditions. The three million gunners of to-day must no longer expect or demand the same generous hunting privileges that were right for hunters fifty years ago, when game was fifty times as plentiful as it is now and there was only one killer for every fifty now in the field. The fatalistic idea that bag-limit laws can save the game is to-day _the curse of all our game birds, mammals and fishes!_ It is a fraud, a delusion and a snare. That miserable fetish has been worshipped much too long. Our game is being exterminated, everywhere, by blind insistence upon ""open seasons,"" and solemn reliance upon ""legal bag-limits."" If a majority of the people of America feel that so long as there is any game alive there must be an annual two months or four months open season for its slaughter, then assuredly we soon will have a gameless continent. The only thing that will save the game is by stopping the killing of it! In establishing and promulgating this principle, the cause of wild-life protection greatly needs three things: money, labor, and publicity. With the first, we can secure the second and third. But can we get it,--and _get it in time to save?_ This volume is in every sense a contribution to a Cause; and as such it ever will remain. I wish the public to receive it on that basis. So much important material has drifted straight to it from other hands that this unexpected aid seems to the author like a good omen. The manuscript has received the benefit of a close and critical reading and correcting by my comrade on the firing-line and esteemed friend, Mr. Madison Grant, through which the text was greatly improved. But for the splendid encouragement and assistance that I have received from him and from Professor Henry Fairneld Osborn the work involved would have borne down rather heavily. The four chapters embracing the ""New Laws Needed; A Roll-Call of the States,"" were critically inspected, corrected and brought down to date by Dr. T.S. Palmer, our highest authority on the game laws of the Nation and the States. For this valuable service the author is deeply grateful. Of course the author is alone responsible for all the opinions and conclusions herein recorded, and for all errors that appear outside of quotations. I trust that the Reader will kindly excuse and forget all the typographic and clerical errors that may have escaped me in the rush that had to be made against Time. W.T.H.

EXTERMINATION CHAPTER I THE FORMER ABUNDANCE OF WILD LIFE _""By my labors my vineyard flourished. But Ahab came. Alas! for Naboth.""_ In order that the American people may correctly understand and judge the question of the extinction or preservation of our wild life, it is necessary to recall the near past. It is not necessary, however, to go far into the details of history; for a few quick glances at a few high points will be quite sufficient for the purpose in view. Any man who reads the books which best tell the story of the development of the American colonies of 1712 into the American nation of 1912, and takes due note of the wild-life features of the tale, will say without hesitation that when the American people received this land from the bountiful hand of Nature, it was endowed with a magnificent and all-pervading supply of valuable wild creatures. The pioneers and the early settlers were too busy even to take due note of that fact, or to comment upon it, save in very fragmentary ways. Nevertheless, the wild-life abundance of early American days survived down to so late a period that it touched the lives of millions of people now living. Any man 55 years of age who when a boy had a taste for ""hunting,""--for at that time there were no ""sportsmen"" in America,--will remember the flocks and herds of wild creatures that he saw and which made upon his mind many indelible impressions. ""Abundance"" is the word with which to describe the original animal life that stocked our country, and all North America, only a short half-century ago. Throughout every state, on every shore-line, in all the millions of fresh water lakes, ponds and rivers, on every mountain range, in every forest, _and even on every desert_, the wild flocks and herds held sway. It was impossible to go beyond the settled haunts of civilized man and escape them. It was a full century after the complete settlement of New England and the Virginia colonies that the wonderful big-game fauna of the great plains and Rocky Mountains was really discovered; but the bison millions, the antelope millions, the mule deer, the mountain sheep and mountain goat were there, all the time. In the early days, the millions of pinnated grouse and quail of the central states attracted no serious attention from the American people-at-large; but they lived and flourished just the same, far down in the seventies, when the greedy market gunners systematically slaughtered them, and barreled them up for ""the market,"" while the foolish farmers calmly permitted them to do it. We obtain the best of our history of the former abundance of North American wild life first from the pages of Audubon and Wilson; next, from the records left by such pioneers as Lewis and Clark, and last from the testimony of living men. To all this we can, many of us, add observations of our own. To me the most striking fact that stands forth in the story of American wild life one hundred years ago is the wide extent and thoroughness of its distribution. Wide as our country is, and marvelous as it is in the diversity of its climates, its soils, its topography, its flora, its riches and its poverty, Nature gave to each square mile and to each acre a generous quota of wild creatures, according to its ability to maintain living things. No pioneer ever pushed so far, or into regions so difficult or so remote, that he did not find awaiting him a host of birds and beasts. Sometimes the pioneer was not a good hunter; usually he was a stupid fisherman; but the ""game"" was there, nevertheless. The time was when every farm had its quota. The part that the wild life of America played in the settlement and development of this continent was so far-reaching in extent, and so enormous in potential value, that it fairly staggers the imagination. From the landing of the Pilgrims down to the present hour the wild game has been the mainstay and the resource against starvation of the pathfinder, the settler, the prospector, and at times even the railroad-builder. In view of what the bison millions did for the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Texas, it is only right and square that those states should now do something for the perpetual preservation of the bison species and all other big game that needs help. For years and years, the antelope millions of the Montana and Wyoming grass-lands fed the scout and Indian-fighter, freighter, cowboy and surveyor, ranchman _and sheep-herder_; but thus far I have yet to hear of one Western state that has ever spent one penny directly for the preservation of the antelope! And to-day we are in a hand-to-hand fight in Congress, and in Montana, with the Wool-Growers Association, which maintains in Washington a keen lobbyist to keep aloft the tariff on wool, and prevent Congress from taking 15 square miles of grass lands on Snow Creek, Montana, for a National Antelope Preserve. All that the wool-growers want is the entire earth, all to themselves. Mr. McClure, the Secretary of the Association says: ""The proper place in which to preserve the big game of the West is in city parks, where it can be protected."" To the colonist of the East and pioneer of the West, the white-tailed deer was an ever present help in time of trouble. Without this omnipresent animal, and the supply of good meat that each white flag represented, the commissariat difficulties of the settlers who won the country as far westward as Indiana would have been many times greater than they were. The backwoods Pilgrim's progress was like this: Trail, deer; cabin, deer; clearing; bear, corn, deer; hogs, deer; cattle, wheat, independence. And yet, how many men are there to-day, out of our ninety millions of Americans and pseudo-Americans, who remember with any feeling of gratitude the part played in American history by the white-tailed deer? Very few! How many Americans are there in our land who now preserve that deer for sentimental reasons, and because his forbears were nation-builders? As a matter of fact, are there any? On every eastern pioneer's monument, the white-tailed deer should figure; and on those of the Great West, the bison and the antelope should be cast in enduring bronze, ""_lest we forget!_"" The game birds of America played a different part from that of the deer, antelope and bison. In the early days, shotguns were few, and shot was scarce and dear. The wild turkey and goose were the smallest birds on which a rifleman could afford to expend a bullet and a whole charge of powder. It was for this reason that the deer, bear, bison, and elk disappeared from the eastern United States while the game birds yet remained abundant. With the disappearance of the big game came the fat steer, hog and hominy, the wheat-field, fruit orchard and poultry galore. The game birds of America, as a class and a mass, have not been swept away to ward off starvation or to rescue the perishing. Even back in the sixties and seventies, very, very few men of the North thought of killing prairie chickens, ducks and quail, snipe and woodcock, in order to keep the hunger wolf from the door. The process was too slow and uncertain; and besides, the really-poor man rarely had the gun and ammunition. Instead of attempting to live on birds, he hustled for the staple food products that the soil of his own farm could produce. First, last and nearly all the time, the game birds of the United States as a whole, have been sacrificed on the altar of Rank Luxury, to tempt appetites that were tired of fried chicken and other farm delicacies. To-day, even the average poor man hunts birds for the joy of the outing, and the pampered epicures of the hotels and restaurants buy game birds, and eat small portions of them, solely to tempt jaded appetites. If there is such a thing as ""class"" legislation, it is that which permits a few sordid market-shooters to slaughter the birds of the whole people in order to sell them to a few epicures. The game of a state belongs to the whole people of the state. The Supreme Court of the United States has so decided. (Geer vs. Connecticut). If it is abundant, it is a valuable asset. The great value of the game birds of America lies not in their meat pounds as they lie upon the table, but in the temptation they annually put before millions of field-weary farmers and desk-weary clerks and merchants to get into their beloved hunting togs, stalk out into the lap of Nature, and say ""Begone, dull Care!"" And the man who has had a fine day in the painted woods, on the bright waters of a duck-haunted bay, or in the golden stubble of September, can fill his day and his soul with six good birds just as well as with sixty. The idea that in order to enjoy a fine day in the open a man must kill a wheel-barrow load of birds, is a mistaken idea; and if obstinately adhered to, it becomes vicious! The Outing in the Open is the thing,--not the blood-stained feathers, nasty viscera and Death in the game-bag. One quail on a fence is worth more to the world than ten in a bag. The farmers of America have, by their own supineness and lack of foresight, permitted the slaughter of a stock of game birds which, had it been properly and wisely conserved, would have furnished a good annual shoot to every farming man and boy of sporting instincts through the past, right down to the present, and far beyond. They have allowed millions of dollars worth of _their_ birds to be coolly snatched away from them by the greedy market-shooters. There is one state in America, and so far as I know _only one_, in which there is at this moment an old-time abundance of game-bird life. That is the state of Louisiana. The reason is not so very far to seek. For the birds that do not migrate,--quail, wild turkeys and doves,--the cover is yet abundant. For the migratory game birds of the Mississippi Valley, Louisiana is a grand central depot, with terminal facilities that are unsurpassed. Her reedy shores, her vast marshes, her long coast line and abundance of food furnish what should be not only a haven but a heaven for ducks and geese. After running the gauntlet of guns all the way from Manitoba and Ontario to the Sunk Lands of Arkansas, the shores of the Gulf must seem like heaven itself. The great forests of Louisiana shelter deer, turkeys, and fur-bearing animals galore; and rabbits and squirrels abound. Naturally, this abundance of game has given rise to an extensive industry in shooting for the market. The ""big interests"" outside the state send their agents into the best game districts, often bringing in their own force of shooters. They comb out the game in enormous quantities, without leaving to the people of Louisiana any decent and fair quid-pro-quo for having despoiled them of their game and shipped a vast annual product outside, to create wealth elsewhere. At present, however, we are but incidentally interested in the short-sightedness of the people of the Pelican State. As a state of oldtime abundance in killable game, the killing records that were kept in the year 1909-10 possess for us very great interest. They throw a startling searchlight on the subject of this chapter,--the former abundance of wild life. From the records that with great pains and labor were gathered by the State Game Commission, and which were furnished me for use here by President Frank M. Miller, we set forth this remarkable exhibit of old-fashioned abundance in game, A.D. 1909. * * * * * OFFICIAL RECORD OF GAME KILLED IN LOUISIANA DURING THE SEASON (12 MONTHS) OF 1909-10 BIRDS Wild Ducks, sea and river 3,176,000 Coots 280,740 Geese and Brant 202,210 Snipe, Sandpiper and Plover 606,635 Quail (Bob-White) 1,140,750 Doves 310,660 Wild Turkeys 2,219 ---------- Total number of game birds killed 5,719,214 MAMMALS Deer 5,470 Squirrels and Rabbits 690,270 ---------- Total of game mammals 695,740 Fur-bearing mammals 1,971,922 ---------- Total of mammals 2,667,662 ---------- Grand total of birds and mammals 8,386,876 * * * * * Of the thousands of slaughtered robins, it would seem that no records exist. It is to be understood that the annual slaughter of wild life in Louisiana never before reached such a pitch as now. Without drastic measures, what will be the inevitable result? Does any man suppose that even the wild millions of Louisiana can long withstand such slaughter as that shown by the official figures given above? It is wildly impossible. But the darkest hour is just before the dawn. At the session of the Louisiana legislature that was held in the spring of 1912, great improvements were made in the game laws of that state. The most important feature was the suppression of wholesale market hunting, by persons who are not residents of the state. A very limited amount of game may be sold and served as food in public places, but the restrictions placed upon this traffic are so effective that they will vastly reduce the annual slaughter. In other respects, also, the cause of wild life protection gained much; for which great credit is due to Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny. It is the way of Americans to feel that because game is abundant in a given place at a given time, it always will be abundant, and may therefore be slaughtered without limit. That was the case last winter in California during the awful slaughter of band-tailed pigeons, as will be noted elsewhere. It is time for all men to be told in the plainest terms that there never has existed, anywhere in historic times, a volume of wild life so great that civilized man could not quickly exterminate it by his methods of destruction. Lift the veil and look at the stories of the bison, the passenger pigeon, the wild ducks and shore birds of the Atlantic coast, and the fur-seal. [Illustration: SHALL WE LEAVE ANY ONE OF THEM OPEN?] As reasoning beings, it is our duty to heed the lessons of history, and not rush blindly on until we perpetrate a continent destitute of wild life. * * * * * CHAPTER II EXTINCT SPECIES OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS For educated, civilized Man to exterminate a valuable wild species of living things is a crime. It is a crime against his own children, and posterity. No man has a right, either moral or legal, to destroy or squander an inheritance of his children that he holds for them in trust. And man, the wasteful and greedy spendthrift that he is, has not created even the humblest of the species of birds, mammals and fishes that adorn and enrich this earth. ""The earth is THE LORD'S, and the fulness thereof!"" With all his wisdom, man has not evolved and placed here so much as a ground-squirrel, a sparrow or a clam. It is true that he has juggled with the wild horse and sheep, the goats and the swine, and produced some hardy breeds that can withstand his abuse without going down before it; but as for species, he has not yet created and placed here even so much as a protozoan. The wild things of this earth are _not_ ours, to do with as we please. They have been given to us _in trust_, and we must account for them to the generations which will come after us and audit our accounts. But man, the shameless destroyer of Nature's gifts, blithely and persistently exterminates one species after another. Fully ten per cent of the human race consists of people who will lie, steal, throw rubbish in parks, and destroy forests and wild life whenever and wherever they can do so without being stopped by a policemen and a club. These are hard words, but they are absolutely true. From ten per cent (or more) of the human race, the high moral instinct which is honest without compulsion _is absent_. The things that seemingly decent citizens,--men posing as gentlemen,--will do to wild game when they secure great chances to slaughter, are appalling. I could fill a book of this size with cases in point. To-day the women of England, Europe and elsewhere are directly promoting the extermination of scores of beautiful species of wild birds by the devilish persistence with which they buy and wear feather ornaments made of their plumage. They are just as mean and cruel as the truck-driver who drives a horse with a sore shoulder and beats him on the street. But they do it! And appeals to them to do otherwise they laugh to scorn, saying, ""I will wear what is fashionable, when I please and where I please!"" As a famous bird protector of England has just written me, ""The women of the smart set are beyond the reach of appeal or protest."" To-day, the thing that stares me in the face every waking hour, like a grisly spectre with bloody fang and claw, is _the extermination of species_. To me, that is a horrible thing. It is wholesale murder, no less. It is capital crime, and a black disgrace to the races of civilized mankind. I say ""civilized mankind,"" because savages don't do it! There are three kinds of extermination: _The practical extermination of a species_ means the destruction of its members to an extent so thorough and widespread that the species disappears from view, and living specimens of it can not be found by seeking for them. In North America this is to-day the status of the whooping crane, upland plover, and several other species. If any individuals are living, they will be met with only by accident. _The absolute extermination_ of a species means that not one individual of it remains alive. Judgment to this effect is based upon the lapse of time since the last living specimen was observed or killed. When five years have passed without a living ""record"" of a wild specimen, it is time to place a species in the class of the totally extinct. _Extermination in a wild state_ means that the only living representatives are in captivity or otherwise under protection. This is the case of the heath hen and David's deer, of China. The American bison is saved from being wholly extinct as a wild animal by the remnant of about 300 head in northern Athabasca, and 49 head in the Yellow-stone Park. It is a serious thing to exterminate a species of any of the vertebrate animals. There are probably millions of people who do not realize that civilized (!) man is the most persistently and wickedly wasteful of all the predatory animals. The lions, the tigers, the bears, the eagles and hawks, serpents, and the fish-eating fishes, all live by destroying life; but they kill only what they think they can consume. If something is by chance left over, it goes to satisfy the hunger of the humbler creatures of prey. _In a state of nature, where wild creatures prey upon wild creatures, such a thing as wanton, wholesale and utterly wasteful slaughter is almost unknown!_ When the wild mink, weasel and skunk suddenly finds himself in the midst of scores of man's confined and helpless domestic fowls, or his caged gulls in a zoological park, an unusual criminal passion to murder for the joy of killing sometimes seizes the wild animal, and great slaughter is the result. From the earliest historic times, it has been the way of savage man, red, black, brown and yellow, to kill as the wild animals do,--only what he can use, or _thinks_ he can use. The Cree Indian impounded small herds of bison, and sometimes killed from 100 to 200 at one time; but it was to make sure of having enough meat and hides, and because he expected to use the product. I think that even the worst enemies of the plains Indians hardly will accuse them of killing large numbers of bison, elk or deer merely for the pleasure of seeing them fall, or taking only their teeth. [Illustration: SIX RECENTLY EXTERMINATED NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS Great Auk Labrador Duck Eskimo Curlew Pallas Cormorant Passenger Pigeon Carolina Parrakeet] It has remained for the wolf, the sheep-killing dog and civilized man to make records of wanton slaughter which puts them in a class together, and quite apart from other predatory animals. When a man can kill bison for their tongues alone, bull elk for their ""tusks"" alone, and shoot a whole colony of hippopotami,--actually damming a river with their bloated and putrid carcasses, all untouched by the knife,--the men who do such things must be classed with the cruel wolf and the criminal dog. It is now desirable that we should pause in our career of destruction long enough to look back upon what we have recently accomplished in the total extinction of species, and also note what we have blocked out for the immediate future. Here let us erect a monument to the dead species of our own times. It is to be doubted whether, up to this hour, any man has made a list of the species of North American birds that have become extinct during the past sixty years. The specialists have no time to spare from their compound differential microscopes, and the bird-killers are too busy with shooting, netting and clubbing to waste any time on such trifles as exterminated species. What does a market-shooter care about birds that can not be killed a second time? As for the farmers, they are so busy raising hogs and prices that their best friends, the birds, get scant attention from them,--until a hen-hawk takes a chicken! Down South, the negroes and poor whites may slaughter robins for food by the ten thousand; but does the northern farmer bother his head about a trifle of that kind? No, indeed. Will he contribute any real money to help put a stop to it? Ask him yourself. Let us pause long enough to reckon up some of our expenditures in species, and in millions of individuals. Let us set down here, in cold blood, a list of the species of our own North American birds that have been totally exterminated in our own times. After that we will have something to say about other species that soon will be exterminated; and the second task is much greater than the first. * * * * * ROLL CALL OF THE DEAD SPECIES OF AMERICAN BIRDS THE GREAT AUK,--_Plautus-impennis_, (Linn.), was a sea-going diving bird about the size of a domestic goose, related to the guillemots, murres and puffins. For a bird endowed only with flipper-like wings, and therefore absolutely unable to fly, this species had an astonishing geographic range. It embraced the shores of northern Europe to North Cape, southern Greenland, southern Labrador, and the Atlantic coast of North America as far south as Massachusetts. Some say, ""as far south as Massachusetts, the Carolinas and Florida,"" but that is a large order, and I leave the A.O.U. to prove that if it can. In the life history of this bird, a great tragedy was enacted in 1800 by sailors, on Funk Island, north of Newfoundland, where men were landed by a ship, and spent several months slaughtering great auks and trying out their fat for oil. In this process, the bodies of thousands of auks were burned as fuel, in working up the remains of tens of thousands of others. On Funk Island, a favorite breeding-place, the great auk was exterminated in 1840, and in Iceland in 1844. Many natives ate this bird with relish, and being easily captured, either on land or sea, the commercialism of its day soon obliterated the species. The last living specimen was seen in 1852, and the last dead one was picked up in Trinity Bay, Ireland, in 1853. There are about 80 mounted and unmounted skins in existence, four skeletons, and quite a number of eggs. An egg is worth about $1200 and a good mounted skin at least double that sum. THE LABRADOR DUCK,--_Camptorhynchus labradoricus_, (Gmel.).--This handsome sea-duck, of a species related to the eider ducks of arctic waters, became totally extinct about 1875, before the scientific world even knew that its existence was threatened. With this species, the exact and final cause of its extinction is to this day unknown. It is not at all probable, however, that its unfortunate blotting out from our bird fauna was due to natural causes, and when the truth becomes known, it is very probable that the hand of man will be revealed. The Labrador duck bred in Labrador, and once frequented our Atlantic coast as far south as Chesapeake Bay; but it is said that it never was very numerous, at least during the twenty-five years preceding its disappearance. About thirty-five skins and mounted museum specimens are all that remain to prove its former existence, and I think there is not even one skeleton. THE PALLAS CORMORANT,--_Carbo perspicillatus_, (Pallas).--In 1741, when the Russian explorer, Commander Bering, discovered the Bering or Commander Islands, in the far-north Pacific, and landed upon them, he also discovered this striking bird species. Its plumage both above and below was a dark metallic green, with blue iridescence on the neck and purple on the shoulders. A pale ring of naked skin around each eye suggested the Latin specific name of this bird. The Pallas cormorant became totally extinct, through causes not positively known, about 1852. THE PASSENGER PIGEON,--_Ectopistes migratoria_, (Linn.).--We place this bird in the totally-extinct class, not only because it is extinct in a wild state, but only one solitary individual, a twenty-year-old female in the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens, now remains alive. One living specimen and a few skins, skeletons and stuffed specimens are all that remain to show for the uncountable millions of pigeons that swarmed over the United States, only yesterday as it were! There is no doubt about where those millions have gone. They went down and out by systematic, wholesale slaughter for the market and the pot, before the shotguns, _clubs_ and _nets_ of the earliest American pot-hunters. Wherever they nested they were slaughtered. It is a long and shameful story, but the grisly skeleton of its Michigan chapter can be set forth in a few words. In 1869, from the town of Hartford, Mich., _three car loads_ of dead pigeons were shipped to market each day for _forty days_, making a total of 11,880,000 birds. It is recorded that another Michigan town marketed 15,840,000 in two years. (See Mr. W.B. Mershon's book, ""The Passenger Pigeon."") Alexander Wilson, the pioneer American ornithologist, was the man who seriously endeavored to estimate by computations the total number of passenger pigeons in one flock that was seen by him. Here is what he has said in his ""American Ornithology"": ""To form a rough estimate of the daily consumption of one of these immense flocks, let us first attempt to calculate the numbers of that above mentioned, as seen in passing between Frankfort and the Indiana territory. If we suppose this column to have been one mile in breadth (and I believe it to have been much more) and that it moved at the rate of one mile in a minute, four hours, the time it continued passing, would make its whole length two hundred and forty miles. Again, supposing that each square yard of this moving body comprehended three pigeons; the square yards in the whole space multiplied by three would give 2,230,272,000 pigeons! An almost inconceivable multitude, and yet probably far below the actual amount."" * * * * * ""Happening to go ashore one charming afternoon, to purchase some milk at a house that stood near the river, and while talking with the people within doors, I was suddenly struck with astonishment at a loud rushing roar, succeeded by instant darkness, which, on the first moment, I took for a tornado about to overwhelm the house and every thing around in destruction. The people observing my surprise, coolly said, 'It is only the pigeons!' On running out I beheld a flock, thirty or forty yards in width, sweeping along very low, between the house and the mountain or height that formed the second bank of the river. These continued passing for more than a quarter of an hour, and at length varied their bearing so as to pass over the mountains, behind which they disappeared before the rear came up. ""In the Atlantic States, though they never appear in such unparalleled multitudes, they are sometimes very numerous; and great havoc is then made amongst them with the gun, the clap-net, and various other implements of destruction. As soon as it is ascertained in a town that the pigeons are flying numerously in the neighborhood, the gunners rise _en masse_; the clap-nets are spread out on suitable situations, commonly on an open height in an old buckwheat field, four or five live pigeons, _with their eyelids sewed up_,[A] are fastened on a movable stick, a small hut of branches is fitted up for the fowler at the distance of forty or fifty yards. By the pulling of a string, the stick on which the pigeons rest is alternately elevated and depressed, which produces a fluttering of their wings, similar to that of birds alighting. This being perceived by the passing flocks, they descend with great rapidity, and finding corn, buckwheat, etc, strewed about, begin to feed, and are instantly, by the pulling of a cord, covered by the net. In this manner ten, twenty, and even thirty dozen have been caught at one sweep. Meantime the air is darkened with large bodies of them moving in various directions; the woods also swarm with them in search of acorns, and the thundering of musquetry is perpetual on all sides from morning to night. Wagon loads of them are poured into market, where they sell from fifty to twenty-five and even twelve cents per dozen; and pigeons become the order of the day at dinner, breakfast and supper, until the very name becomes sickening."" [Footnote A: To-day, we think that the fowlers of the roccolos of northern Italy are very cruel in their methods of catching song-birds wholesale for the market (chapter xi); but our own countrymen of Wilson's day were just as cruel in the method described above.] * * * * * The range of the passenger pigeon covered nearly the whole United States from the Atlantic coast westward to the Rocky Mountains. A few bold pigeons crossed the Rocky Mountains into Oregon, northern California and Washington, but only as ""stragglers,"" few and far between. The wide range of this bird was worthy of a species that existed in millions, and it was persecuted literally all along the line. The greatest slaughter was in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1848 Massachusetts gravely passed a law protecting the _netters_ of wild pigeons from foreign interference! There was a fine of $10 for damaging nets, or frightening pigeons away from them. This was on the theory that the pigeons were so abundant they could not by any possibility ever become scarce, and that pigeon-slaughter was a legitimate industry. In 1867, the State of New York found that the wild pigeon needed protection, and enacted a law to that effect. The year 1868 was the last year in which great numbers of passenger pigeons nested in that State. Eaton, in ""The Birds of New York,"" said that ""millions of birds occupied the timber along Bell's Run, near Ceres, Alleghany County, on the Pennsylvania line."" In 1870, Massachusetts gave pigeons protection except during an ""open season,"" and in 1878 Pennsylvania elected to protect pigeons on their nesting grounds. The passenger pigeon millions were destroyed so quickly, and so thoroughly _en masse_, that the American people utterly failed to comprehend it, and for thirty years obstinately refused to believe that the species had been suddenly wiped off the map of North America. There was years of talk about the great flocks having ""taken refuge in South America,"" or in Mexico, and being still in existence. There were surmises about their having all ""gone out to sea,"" and perished on the briny deep. A thousand times, at least, wild pigeons have been ""reported"" as having been ""seen."" These rumors have covered nearly every northern state, the whole of the southwest, and California. For years and years we have been patiently writing letters to explain over and over that the band-tailed pigeon of the Pacific coast, and the red-billed pigeon of Arizona and the southwest are neither of them the passenger pigeon, and never can be. There was a long period wherein we believed many of the pigeon reports that came from the states where the birds once were most numerous; but that period has absolutely passed. During the past five years large cash rewards, aggregating about $5000, have been offered for the discovery of one nesting pair of genuine passenger pigeons. Many persons have claimed this reward (of Professor C.F. Hodge, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass.), and many claims have been investigated. The results have disclosed many _mourning doves_, but not one pigeon. Now we understand that the quest is closed, and hope has been abandoned. The passenger pigeon is a dead species. The last wild specimen (so we believe) that ever will reach the hands of man, was taken near Detroit, Michigan, on Sept. 14, 1908, and mounted by C. Campion. That is the one definite, positive record of the past ten years. The fate of this species should be a lasting lesson to the world at large. Any wild bird or mammal species can be exterminated by commercial interests in twenty years time, or less. THE ESKIMO CURLEW,_--Numenius borealis_, (Forst.). This valuable game bird once ranged all along the Atlantic coast of North America, and wherever found it was prized for the table. It preferred the fields and meadows to the shore lines, and was the companion of the plovers of the uplands, especially the golden plover. ""About 1872,"" says Mr. Forbush, ""there was a great flight of these birds on Cape Cod and Nantucket. They were everywhere; and enormous numbers were killed. They could be bought of boys at six cents apiece. Two men killed $300 worth of these birds at that time."" Apparently, that was the beginning of the end of the ""dough bird,"" which was another name for this curlew. In 1908 Mr. G.H. Mackay stated that this bird and the golden plover had decreased 90 per cent in fifty years, and in the last ten years of that period 90 per cent of the remainder had gone. ""Now (1908),"" says Mr. Forbush, ""ornithologists believe that the Eskimo curlew is practically extinct, as only a few specimens have been recorded since the beginning of the twentieth century."" The very last record is of two specimens collected at Waco, York County, Nebraska, in March, 1911, and recorded by Mr. August Eiche. Of course, it is possible that other individuals may still survive; but so far as our knowledge extends, the species is absolutely dead. * * * * * In the West Indies and the Guadeloupe Islands, five species of macaws and parrakeets have passed out without any serious note of their disappearance on the part of the people of the United States. It is at least time to write brief obituary notices of them. We are indebted to the Hon. Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England, for essential facts regarding these species as set forth in his sumptuous work ""Extinct Birds"". THE CUBAN TRICOLORED MACAW,--_Ara tricolor_, (Gm.). In 1875, when the author visited Cuba and the Isle of Pines, he was informed by Professor Poey that he was ""about ten years too late"" to find this fine species alive. It was exterminated for food purposes, about 1864, and only four specimens are known to be in existence. [Illustration SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN Great Auk Pallas Cormorant Labrador Duck Passenger Pigeon Eskimo Curlew Cuban Tricolor Macaw Gosse's Macaw Guadeloupe Macaw Yellow Winged Green Parrot Purple Guadaloupe Parakeet Carolina Parakeet EXTERMINATED BY CIVILIZED MAN 1840-1910] GOSSE'S MACAW,--_Ara gossei_, (Roth.).--This species once inhabited the Island of Jamaica. It was exterminated about 1800, and so far as known not one specimen of it is in existence. GUADELOUPE MACAW,--_Ara guadeloupensis_, (Clark).--All that is known of the life history of this large bird is that once it inhabited the Guadeloupe Islands. The date and history of its disappearance are both unknown, and there is not one specimen of it in existence. YELLOW-WINGED GREEN PARROT,--_Amazona olivacea_, (Gm.).--Of the history of this Guadeloupe species, also, nothing is known, and there appear to be no specimens of it in existence. PURPLE GUADELOUPE PARRAKEET,--_Anodorhynchus purpurescens_, (Rothschild).--This is another dead species, that once lived in the Guadeloupe Islands, and passed away silently and unnoticed at the time, leaving no records of its existence, and no specimens. THE CAROLINA PARRAKEET,--_Conuropsis carolinensis_, (Linn.), brings us down to the present moment. To this charming little green-and-yellow bird, we are in the very act of bidding everlasting farewell. Ten specimens remain alive in captivity, six of which are in the Cincinnati Zoological Garden, three are in the Washington Zoological Park and one is in the New York Zoological Park. Regarding wild specimens, it is possible that some yet remain, in some obscure and _neglected_ corner of Florida; but it is extremely doubtful whether the world ever will find any of them alive. Mrs. Minnie Moore Willson, of Kissimee, Fla. reports the species as totally extinct in Florida. Unless we would strain at a gnat, we may just as well enter this species in the dead class; for there is no reason to hope that any more wild specimens ever will be found. The former range of this species embraced the whole southeastern and central United States. From the Gulf it extended to Albany, N.Y., northern Ohio and Indiana, northern Iowa, Nebraska, central Colorado and eastern Texas, from which it will be seen that once it was widely distributed. It was shot because it was destructive to fruit and for its plumage, and many were trapped alive, to be kept in captivity. I know that one colony, near the mouth of the Sebastian River, east coast of Florida, was exterminated in 1898 by a local hunter, and I regret to say that it was done in the hope of selling the living birds to a New York bird-dealer. By holding bags over the holes in which the birds were nesting, the entire colony, of about 16 birds, was caught. Everywhere else than in Florida, the Carolina parrakeet has long been extinct. In 1904 a flock of 13 birds was seen near Lake Okechobee; but in Florida many calamities can overtake a flock of birds in eight years. The birds in captivity are not breeding, and so far as perpetuation by them is concerned, they are only one remove from mounted museum specimens. This parrakeet is the only member of its order that ranged into the United States during our own times, and with its disappearance the Order Psittaciformes totally disappears from our country. * * * * * CHAPTER III THE NEXT CANDIDATES FOR OBLIVION In the world of human beings, murder is the most serious of all crimes. To take from a man that which no one ever can restore to him, his life, is murder; and its penalty is the most severe of all penalties. There are circumstances under which the killing of a wild animal may be so wanton, so revolting and so utterly reprehensible that the act may justly be classed as murder. The man who kills a walrus from the deck of a steamer that he knows will not stop; the man who wantonly killed the whole colony of hippopotami that Mr. Dugmore photographed in life; the man who last winter shot bull elk in Wyoming for their two ugly and shapeless teeth, and the man who wantonly shot down a half-tame deer ""for fun"" near Carmel, Putnam County, New York, in the summer of 1912,--all were guilty of _murdering_ wild animals. The murder of a wild animal species consists in taking from it that which man with all his cunning and all his preserves and breeding can not give back to it,--its God-given place in the ranks of Living Things. Where is man's boasted intelligence, or his sense of proportion, that every man does not see the monstrous moral obliquity involved in the destruction of a species! If the beautiful Taj Mehal at Agra should be destroyed by vandals, the intelligent portion of humanity would be profoundly shocked, even though the hand of man could at will restore the shrine of sorrowing love. To-day the great Indian rhinoceros, certainly one of the most wonderful four-footed animals still surviving, is actually being exterminated; and even the people of India and England are viewing it with an indifference that is appalling. Of course there are among Englishmen a great many sportsmen and several zoologists who really care; but they do not constitute one-tenth of one per-cent of the men who ought to care! In the museums, we stand in awe and wonder before the fossil skeleton of the Megatherium, and the savants struggle to unveil its past, while the equally great and marvelous _Rhinoceros indicus_ is being rushed into oblivion. We marvel at the fossil shell of the gigantic turtle called _Collosochelys atlas_, while the last living representatives of the gigantic land tortoises are being exterminated in the Galapagos Islands and the Sychelles, for their paltry oil and meat; and only one man (Hon. Walter Rothschild) is doing aught to save any of them in their haunts, where they can breed. The dodo of Mauritius was exterminated by swine, whose bipedal descendants have exterminated many other species since that time. A failure to appreciate either the beauty or the value of our living birds, quadrupeds and fishes is the hall-mark of arrested mental development and ignorance. The victim is _not always to blame_; but in this practical world the cornerstone of legal jurisprudence is the inexorable principle that ""ignorance of the law excuses no man."" These pages are addressed to my countrymen, and the world at large, not as a reproach upon the dead Past which is gone beyond recall, but in the faint hope of somewhere and somehow arousing forces that will reform the Present and save the Future. The extermination of wild species that now is proceeding throughout the world, is a dreadful thing. It is not only injurious to the economy of the world, but it is a shame and a disgrace to the civilized portion of the human race. It is of little avail that I should here enter into a detailed description of each species that now is being railroaded into oblivion. The bookshelves of intelligent men and women are filled with beautiful and adequate books on birds and quadrupeds, wherein the status of each species may be determined, almost without effort. There is time and space only in which to notice the most prominent of the doomed species, and perhaps discuss a few examples by way of illustration. Here is a * * * * * PARTIAL LIST OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS THREATENED WITH EARLY EXTERMINATION WHOOPING CRANE TRUMPETER SWAN AMERICAN FLAMINGO ROSEATE SPOONBILL SCARLET IBIS LONG-BILLED CURLEW HUDSONIAN GODWIT UPLAND PLOVER RED-BREASTED SANDPIPER GOLDEN PLOVER DOWITCHER WILLET PECTORAL SANDPIPER BLACK-CAPPED PETREL AMERICAN EGRET SNOWY EGRET WOOD DUCK BAND-TAILED PIGEON HEATH HEN SAGE GROUSE PRAIRIE SHARP-TAIL PINNATED GROUSE WHITE-TAILED KITE * * * * * THE WHOOPING CRANE.--This splendid bird will almost certainly be the next North American species to be totally exterminated. It is the only new world rival of the numerous large and showy cranes of the old world; for the sandhill crane is not in the same class as the white, black and blue giants of Asia. We will part from our stately _Grus americanus_ with profound sorrow, for on this continent we ne'er shall see his like again. The well-nigh total disappearance of this species has been brought close home to us by the fact that there are less than half a dozen individuals alive in captivity, while in a wild state the bird is so rare as to be quite unobtainable. For example, for nearly five years an English gentlemen has been offering $1,000 for a pair, and the most enterprising bird collector in America has been quite unable to fill the order. So far as our information extends, the last living specimen captured was taken six or seven years ago. The last wild birds seen and reported were observed by Ernest Thompson Seton, who saw five below Fort McMurray, Saskatchewan, October 16th, 1907, and by John F. Ferry, who saw one at Big Quill Lake, Saskatchewan, in June, 1909. The range of this species once covered the eastern two-thirds of the continent of North America. It extended from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains, and from Great Bear Lake to Florida and Texas. Eastward of the Mississippi it has for twenty years been totally extinct, and the last specimens taken alive were found in Kansas and Nebraska. [Illustration: WHOOPING CRANES IN THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK Very Soon this Species will Become Totally Extinct.] THE TRUMPETER SWAN.--Six years ago this species was regarded as so nearly extinct that a doubting ornithological club of Boston refused to believe on hearsay evidence that the New York Zoological Park contained a pair of living birds, and a committee was appointed, to investigate in person, and report. Even at that time, skins were worth all the way from $100 to $150 each; and when swan skins sell at either of those figures it is because there are people who believe that the species either is on the verge of extinction, or has passed it. The pair referred to above was acquired in 1900. Since that time, Dr. Leonard C. Sanford procured in 1910 two living birds from a bird dealer who obtained them on the coast of Virginia. We have done our utmost to induce our pair to breed, but without any further results than nest-building. The loss of the trumpeter swan (_Olor americanus_) will not be so great, nor felt so keenly, as the blotting out of the whooping crane. It so closely resembles the whistling swan that only an ornithologist can recognize the difference, a yellow spot on the side of the upper mandible, near its base. The whistling swan yet remains in fair numbers, but it is to be feared that soon it will go as the trumpeter has gone. THE AMERICAN FLAMINGO, SCARLET IBIS AND ROSEATE SPOONBILL are three of the most beautiful and curious water-haunting birds of the tropics. Once all three species inhabited portions of the southern United States; but now all three are gone from our star-spangled bird fauna. The brilliant scarlet plumage of the flamingo and ibis, and the exquisite pink rose-color and white of the spoonbill naturally attracted the evil eyes of the ""milliner's taxidermists"" and other bird-butchers. From Florida these birds quickly vanished. The six great breeding colonies of Flamingoes on Andros Island, Bahamas, have been reduced to two, and from Prof. E.A. Goeldi, of the State Museum Goeldi, Para, Brazil, have come bitter complaints of the slaughter of scarlet ibises in South America by plume-hunters in European pay. I know not how other naturalists regard the future of the three species named above, but my opinion is that unless the European feather trade is quickly stopped as to wild plumage, they are absolutely certain to be shot into total oblivion, within a very few years. The plumage of these birds has so much commercial value, for fishermen's flies as well as for women's hats, that the birds will be killed as long as their feathers can be sold and any birds remain alive. Zoologically, the flamingo is the most odd and interesting bird on the American continent except the emperor penguin. Its beak baffles description, its long legs and webbed feet are a joke, its nesting habits are amazing, and its food habits the despair of most zoological-garden keepers. Millions of flamingos inhabit the shores of a number of small lakes in the interior of equatorial East Africa, but that species is not brilliant scarlet all over the neck and head, as is the case with our species. If the American flamingo, scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbill, one or all of them, are to be saved from total extinction, efforts must be made in each of the countries in which they breed and live. Their preservation is distinctly a burden upon the countries of South America that lie eastward of the Andes, and on Yucatan, Cuba and the Bahamas. The time has come when the Government of the Bahama Islands should sternly forbid the killing of any more flamingos, on any pretext whatever; and if the capture of living specimens for exhibition purposes militates against the welfare of the colonies, _they should forbid that also_. THE UPLAND PLOVER, OR ""BARTRAMIAN SANDPIPER.""--Apparently this is the next shore-bird species that will follow the Eskimo curlew into oblivion. Four years ago,--a long period for a species that is on the edge of extermination,--Mr. E.H. Forbush[B] wrote of it as follows: ""The Bartramian Sandpiper, commonly known as the Upland Plover, a bird which formerly bred on grassy hills all over the State and migrated southward along our coasts in great flocks, is in imminent danger of extirpation. A few still breed in Worcester and Berkshire Counties, or Nantucket, so there is still a nucleus which, if protected, may save the species. Five reports from localities where this bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction, and four as extinct. This is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land, feeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms. It is one of the finest of all birds for the table. An effort should be made at once to save this useful species."" [Footnote B: ""Special Report on the Decrease of Certain Birds, and its Causes.""--Mass. State Board of Agriculture, 1908.] THE BLACK-CAPPED PETREL, (_Aestrelata hasitata_).--This species is already recorded in the A.O.U. ""Check list"" as extinct; but it appears that this may not as yet be absolutely true. On January 1, 1912, a strange thing happened. A much battered and exhausted black-capped petrel was picked up alive in Central Park, New York, taken to the menagerie, and kept there during the few days that it survived. When it died it was sent to the American Museum; and this may easily prove to be the last living record for that species. In reality, this species might as well be listed with those totally extinct. Formerly it ranged from the Antilles to Ohio and Ontario, and the causes of its blotting out are not yet definitely known. This ocean-going bird once had a wide range overseas in the temperate areas of the North Atlantic. It is recorded from Ulster County, New York, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and Florida. It was about of the size of the common tern. THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR, (_Gymnogyps californianus_).--I feel that the existence of this species hangs on a very slender thread. This is due to its alarmingly small range, the insignificant number of individuals now living, the openness of the species to attack, and the danger of its extinction by poison. Originally this remarkable bird,--the largest North American bird of prey,--ranged as far northward as the Columbia River, and southward for an unknown distance. Now its range is reduced to seven counties in southern California, although it is said to extend from Monterey Bay to Lower California, and eastward to Arizona. Regarding the present status and the future of this bird, I have been greatly disturbed in mind. When a unique and zoologically important species becomes reduced in its geographic range to a small section of a single state, it seems to me quite time for alarm. For some time I have counted this bird as one of those threatened with early extermination, and as I think with good reason. In view of the swift calamities that now seem able to fall on species like thunderbolts out of clear skies, and wipe them off the earth even before we know that such a fate is impending, no species of seven-county distribution is safe. Any species that is limited to a few counties of a single state is liable to be wiped out in five years, by poison, or traps, or lack of food. [Illustration: CALIFORNIA CONDOR Now Living in the New York Zoological Park.] On order to obtain the best and also the most conservative information regarding this species, I appealed to the Curator of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, of the University of California. Although written in the mountain wilds, I promptly received the valuable contribution that appears below. As a clear, precise and conservative survey of an important species, it is really a model document. * * * * * THE STATUS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR IN 1912 _By Joseph Grinnell_ ""To my knowledge, the California Condor has been definitely observed within the past five years in the following California counties: Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Kern, and Tulare. In parts of Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern counties the species is still fairly common, for a large bird, probably equal in numbers to the golden eagle in those regions that are suited to it. By suitable country I mean cattle-raising, mountainous territory, of which there are still vast areas, and which are not likely to be put to any other use for a very long time, if ever, on account of the lack of water. ""While in Kern County last April, I was informed by a reliable man who lives near the Tejon Rancho that he had counted twenty-five condors in a single day, since January 1 of the present year. These were on the Tejon Rancho, which is an enormous cattle range covering parts of the Tehachapi and San Emigdio Mountains. ""Our present state law provides complete protection for the condor and its eggs; and the State Fish and Game Commission, in granting permits for collectors, always adds the phrase--'except the California condor and its eggs.' I know of two special permits having been issued, but neither of these were used; that is, no 'specimens' have been taken since 1908, as far as I am aware. ""In my travels about the state, I have found that practically everyone knows that the condor is protected. Still, there is always the hunting element who do not hesitate to shoot anything alive and out of the ordinary, and a certain percentage of the condors are doubtless picked off each year by such criminals. It is possible, also, that the mercenary egg-collector continues to take his annual rents, though if this is done it is kept very quiet. It is my impression that the present fatalities from all sources are fully balanced by the natural rate of increase. ""There is one factor that has militated against the condor more than any other one thing; namely, the restriction in its food source. Its forage range formerly included most of the great valleys adjacent to its mountain retreats. But now the valleys are almost entirely devoted to agriculture, and of course far more thickly settled than formerly. ""The mountainous areas where the condor is making its last stand seem to me likely to remain adapted to the bird's existence for many years,--fifty years, if not longer. Of course, this is conditional upon the maintenance and enforcement of the present laws. There is also the enlightenment of public sentiment in regard to the preservation of wild life, which I believe can be depended upon. This is a matter of general education, which is, fortunately, and with no doubt whatever, progressing at a quite perceptible rate. ""Yes; I should say that the condor has a fair chance to survive, in limited numbers. ""Another bird which in my opinion is far nearer extinction than the condor, so far as California is concerned, is the white-tailed kite. This is a perfectly harmless bird, but one which harries over the marshes, where it has been an easy target for the idle duck-hunter. Then, too, its range was limited to the valley bottoms, where human settlement is increasingly close. I know of only _two_ live pairs within the state last year! ""Finally, let me remark that the rate of increase of the California condor is not one whit less than that of the band-tailed pigeon! Yet, there is no protection at all for the latter in this state, even in the nesting season; and thousands were shot last spring, in the unprecedented concentration of the species in the southern coast counties. (See Chambers in _The Condor_ for May, 1912, p. 108.)"" * * * * * The California Condor is one of the only two species of condor now living, and it is the only one found in North America. As a matter of national pride, and a duty to posterity, the people of the United States can far better afford to lose a million dollars from their national treasury than to allow that bird to become extinct. Its preservation for all coming time is distinctly a white man's burden upon the state of California. The laws now in force for the condor's protection are not half adequate! I think there is no law by which the accidental poisoning of those birds, by baits put out for coyotes and foxes, can be stopped. A law to prevent the use of poisoned meat baits anywhere in southern California, should be enacted at the next session of California's legislature. The fine for molesting a condor should be raised to $500, with a long prison-term as an alternative. A competent, interested game warden should be appointed _solely for the protection of the condors_. It is time to count those birds, keep them under observation, and have an annual report upon their condition. THE HEATH HEN.--But for the protection that has been provided for it by the ornithologists of Massachusetts, and particularly Dr. George W. Field, William Brewster and John E. Thayer, the heath hen or eastern pinnated grouse would years ago have become totally extinct. New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts began to protect that species entirely too late. It was given five-year close seasons, without avail. Then it was given ten-year close seasons, but it was _too late_! To-day, the species exists only in one locality, the island of Martha's Vineyard, and concerning its present status, Mr. Forbush has recently furnished us the following clear statement: ""The heath hens increased for two years after the Massachusetts Fish and Game Commission established a reservation for them, but in 1911 they had not increased. There are probably about two hundred birds extant. ""I found a great many marsh hawks on the Island and the Commission did not kill them, believing them to be beneficial. In watching them, I concluded that they were catching the young heath hens. A large number of these hawks have been shot and their stomachs sent to Washington for examination, as I was too busy at the time to examine them. So far as I know, no report of the examination has been made, but Dr. Field himself examined a few of the stomachs and found the remains of the heath hen in some. ""The warden now says that during the past two years, the heath hen has not increased, but I can give you no definite evidence of this. I am quite sure they are being killed by natives of the island and that at least one collector supplies birds for museums. We are trying to get evidence of this. ""I believe if the heath hen is to be increased in numbers and brought back to this country, we shall have to have more than one warden on the reservation and, eventually, we shall have to establish the bird on the mainland also."" [Illustration: PINNATED GROUSE, OR ""PRAIRIE CHICKEN"" From the ""American Natural History""] THE PINNATED GROUSE, SAGE GROUSE AND PRAIRIE SHARP-TAIL.--In view of the fate of the grouse of the United States, as it has been wrought out thus far in all the more thickly settled areas, and particularly in view of the history of the heath hen, we have no choice but to regard all three of the species named above as absolutely certain to become totally extinct, within a short period of years, unless the conditions surrounding them are immediately and radically changed for the better. Personally, I do not believe that the gunners and game-hogs of Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California will permit any one of those species to be saved. If the present open seasons prevail in the states that I have mentioned above, no power on earth can save those three species of grouse from the fate of the heath hen. To-day their representatives exist only in small shreds and patches, and from fully nineteen-twentieths of their original ranges they are forever gone. The sage grouse will be the first species to go. It is the largest, the most conspicuous, the one most easily found, and the biggest mark for the gunner. Those who have seen this bird in its native sage-brush well understand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter. Many appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse; but the open seasons continue. The gunners of the states in which a few remnants still exist are determined to have them, all; and the state legislatures seem disposed to allow the killers to have their way. It may be however, that like New York with the heath hen, they will arouse and virtuously lock the stable door--after the horse has been stolen! [Illustration: SAGE GROUSE The First of the Upland Game Birds that will Become Extinct] THE SNOWY EGRET AND AMERICAN EGRET, (_Egretta candidissima and Herodias egretta_).--These unfortunate birds, cursed for all time by the commercially valuable ""aigrette"" plumes that they bear, have had a very narrow escape from total extinction in the United States, despite all the efforts made to save them. The ""plume-hunters"" of the millinery trade have been, _and still are_, determined to have the last feather and the last drop of egret blood. In an effort to stop the slaughter in at least one locality in Florida, Warden Guy Bradley was killed by a plume-hunter, who of course escaped all punishment through the heaven-born ""sympathy"" of a local jury. Of the bloody egret slaughter in Florida, not one-tenth of the whole story ever has been told. Millions of adult birds,--all there were,--were killed _in the breeding season_, when the plumes were ripe for the market; and millions of young birds starved in their nests. It was a common thing for a rookery of several hundred birds to be attacked by the plume-hunters, and in two or three days utterly destroyed. The same bloody work is going on to-day in Venezuela and Brazil; and the stories and ""affidavits"" stating that the millions of egret plumes being shipped annually from those countries are ""shed feathers,"" ""picked up off the ground,"" are absolute lies. The men who have sworn to those lies are perjurers, and should be punished for their crimes. (See Chapter XIII). By 1908, the plume-hunters had so far won the fight for the egrets that Florida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the Colorado desert. Until Mr. E.A. McIlhenny's egret preserve, at Avery Island, Louisiana, became a pronounced success, we had believed that our two egrets soon would become totally extinct in the United States. But Mr. McIlhenny has certainly saved those birds to our fauna. In 1892 he started an egret and heron preserve, close beside his house on Avery Island. By 1900 it was an established success. To-day 20,000 pairs of egrets and herons are living and breeding in that bird refuge, and the two egret species are safe in at least one spot in our own country. [Illustration: SNOWY EGRETS IN THE McILHENNY EGRET PRESERVE It is at This Period That the Parent Birds are Killed for Their Plumes, and the Young Starve in the Nest Photo by E.A. McIlhenny] Three years ago, I think there were not many bird-lovers in the United States, who believed it possible to prevent the total extinction of both egrets from our fauna. All the known rookeries accessible to plume-hunters had been totally destroyed. Two years ago, the secret discovery of several small, hidden colonies prompted William Dutcher, President of the National Association of Audubon Societies, and Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson, Secretary, to attempt the protection of those colonies. With a fund contributed for the purpose, wardens were hired and duly commissioned. As previously stated, one of those wardens was shot dead in cold blood by a plume hunter. The task of guarding swamp rookeries from the attacks of money-hungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumes were worth their weight in gold, is a very chancy proceeding. There is now one warden in Florida who says that ""before they get my rookery they will first have to get me."" Thus far the protective work of the Audubon Association has been successful. Now there are twenty colonies, which contain all told, about 5,000 egrets and about 120,000 herons and ibises which are guarded by the Audubon wardens. One of the most important is on Bird Island, a mile out in Orange Lake, central Florida, and it is ably defended by Oscar E. Baynard. To-day, the plume hunters who do not dare to raid the guarded rookeries are trying to study out the lines of flight of the birds, to and from their feeding-grounds, and shoot them in transit. Their motto is--""Anything to beat the law, and get the plumes."" It is there that the state of Florida should take part in the war. The success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year a number of egrets were seen in eastern Massachusetts--for the first time in many years. And so to-day the question is, can the wardens continue to hold the plume-hunters at bay? THE WOOD-DUCK (_Aix sponsa_), by many bird-lovers regarded as the most beautiful of all American birds, is threatened with extinction, in all the states that it still inhabits with the exception of eight. Long ago (1901) the U.S. Biological Survey sounded a general alarm for this species by the issue of a special bulletin regarding its disappearance, and advising its protection by long close seasons. To their everlasting honor, eight states responded, by the enactment of long close-season laws. This, is the ROLL OF HONOR CONNECTICUT MAINE MASSACHUSETTS NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW JERSEY NEW YORK VERMONT WEST VIRGINIA [Illustration: WOOD DUCK Regularly Killed as ""Food"" in 15 States] And how is it with the other states that number the wood-duck in their avian faunas? I am ashamed to tell; but it is necessary that the truth should be known. Surely we will find that if the other states have not the grace to protect this bird on account of its exquisite beauty they will not penalize it by extra long open seasons. _A number of them have taken pains to provide extra long_ OPEN _seasons on this species, usually of five or six months!!_ And this for a bird so exquisitely beautiful that shooting it for the table is like dining on birds of paradise. Here is a partial list of them: * * * * * WOOD-DUCK-EATING STATES (1912) Georgia kills and eats the Wood-duck from Sept. 1, to Feb. 1. Indiana, Iowa and Kansas do so "" Sept. 1, to Apr. 15. Kentucky, (extra long!) does so "" Aug. 15, to Apr. 1. Louisiana (extra long!) "" "" "" Sept. 1, to Mar. 1. Maryland "" "" "" Nov. 1, to Apr. 1. Michigan "" "" "" Oct. 15, to Jan. 1. Nebraska (extra long!) "" "" "" Sept. 1, to Apr. 1. Ohio "" "" "" Sept. 1, to Jan. 1. Pennsylvania, (extra long!) "" "" "" Sept. 1, to Apr. 11. Rhode Island, "" "" "" "" "" Aug. 15, to Apr. 1. South Carolina "" "" "" "" "" Sept. 1, to Mar. 1. South Dakota "" "" "" "" "" Sept. 10, to Apr. 10. Tennessee "" "" "" "" "" Aug. 1, to Apr. 15. Virginia "" "" "" Aug. 1, to Jan. 1. Wisconsin "" "" "" Sept. 1, to Jan. 1. The above are the states that really possess the wood-duck and that should give it, one and all, a series of five-year close seasons. Now, is not the record something to blush for? Is there in those fifteen states _nothing_ too beautiful or too good to go into the pot? * * * * * THE WOODCOCK _(Philohela minor)_, is a bird regarding which my bird-hunting friends and I do not agree. I say that as a species it is steadily disappearing, and presently will become extinct, unless it is accorded better protection. They reply: ""Well, I can show you where there are woodcock yet!"" A few months ago a Nova Scotian writer in _Forest and Stream_ came out with the bold prediction that three more years of the usual annual slaughter of woodcock will bring the species to the verge of extinction in that Province. It is such occurrences as this that bring the end of a species: ""Last fall [1911, at Norwalk, Conn.] we had a good flight of woodcock, and it is a shame the way they were slaughtered. I know of a number of cases where twenty were killed by one gun in the day, and heard of one case of fifty. This is all wrong, and means the end of the woodcock, if continued. There is no doubt we need a bag limit on woodcock, as much as on quail or partridge."" (""Woodcock"" in _Forest and Stream_, Mar. 2, 1912.) As far back as 1901, Dr. A.K. Fisher of the Biological Survey predicted that the woodcock and wood-duck would both become extinct unless better protected. As yet, the better protection demanded has not materialized to any great extent. Says Mr. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, in his admirable ""Special Report,"" p. 45: ""The woodcock is decreasing all over its range in the East, and needs the strongest protection. Of thirty-eight Massachusetts reports, thirty-six state that ""woodcock are decreasing,"" ""rare"" or ""extinct,"" while one states that they are holding their own, and one that they are increasing slightly since the law was passed prohibiting their sale."" Let not any honest American or Canadian sportsman lullaby himself into the belief that the woodcock is safe from extermination. As sure as the world, it is _going_! The fact that a little pocket here or there contains a few birds does not in the slightest degree disprove the main fact. If the sportsmen of this country desire to save the seed stock of woodcock, they must give it _everywhere_ five or ten-year close seasons, and _do it immediately_! OUR SHORE BIRDS IN GENERAL.--This group of game birds will be the first to be exterminated in North America as a _group_. Of all our birds, these are the most illy fitted to survive. They are very conspicuous, very unwary, easy to find if alive, and easy to shoot. Never in my life have any shore birds except woodcock and snipe appealed to me as real game. They are too easy to kill, too trivial when killed, and some of them are too rank and fishy on the plate. As game for men I place them on a level with barnyard ducks or orchard turkeys. I would as soon be caught stealing a sheep as to be seen trying to shoot fishy yellow legs or little joke sandpipers for the purpose of feeding upon them. And yet, thousands of full-grown men, some of them six feet high, grow indignant and turn red in the face at the mention of a law to give all the shore-birds of New York a five-year close season. But for all that, gentlemen of the gun, there are exactly two alternatives between which you shall choose: (1) Either give the woodcock of the eastern United States just _ten times_ the protection that it now has, or (2) bid the species a long farewell. If you elect to slaughter old _Philohela minor_ on the altar of Selfishness, then it will be in order for the millions of people who do not kill birds to say whether that proposal shall be consummated or not. Read if you please Mr. W.A. McAtee's convincing pamphlet (Biological Survey, No. 79), on ""Our Vanishing Shore Birds,"" reproduced in full in Chapter XXIII. He says: ""Throughout the eastern United States, shore birds are fast vanishing. Many of them have been so reduced that _extermination seems imminent_. So averse to shore birds are present conditions [of slaughter] that the wonder is that any escape. All the shore birds of the United States are in great need of better protection.... Shore birds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast numbers are left. Their limited powers of reproduction, coupled with the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their increase slow, and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination. So great is their economic value that their retention in the game list and their destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture."" And yet, here in New York state there are many men who think they ""know,"" who indignantly scoff at the idea that our shore birds need a five-year close season to help save them from annihilation. The writer's appeal for this at a recent convention of the New York State Fish, Game and Forest League fell upon deaf ears, and was not even seriously discussed. The shore-birds must be saved; and just at present it seems that the only persons who will do it are those who are _not_ sportsmen, and who never kill game! If the sportsmen persist in refusing to act, to them we must appeal. Besides the woodcock and snipe, the species that are most seriously threatened with extinction at an early date are the following: SPECIES IN GREAT DANGER Willet _Catoptrophorus semipalmatus_ Dowitcher _Macrorhamphus griseus_ Knot: Red-Breasted Sandpiper _Tryngites subruficollis_ Upland Plover _Bartramia longicauda_ Golden Plover _Charadrius dominicus_ Pectoral Sandpiper _Pisobia maculata_ Of these fine species, Mr. Forbush, whose excellent knowledge of the shore birds of the Atlantic coast is well worth the most serious consideration, says that the upland plover, or Bartramian sandpiper, ""is in imminent danger of extinction. Five reports from localities where this bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction, and four as extinct. This is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land, feeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms.... There is no difference of opinion in regard to the diminution of the shore birds; the reports from all quarters are the same. It is noteworthy that practically all observers agree that, considering all species, these birds have fallen off about 75 per cent within twenty-five to forty years, and that several species are nearly extirpated."" [Illustration: THE GRAY SQUIRREL, A FAMILIAR FRIEND WHEN PROTECTED] In 1897 when the Zoological Society published my report on the ""Extermination of Our Birds and Mammals,"" we put down the decrease in the volume of bird life in Massachusetts during the previous fifteen years at twenty-seven per cent. The later and more elaborate investigations of Mr. Forbush have satisfactorily vindicated the accuracy of that estimate. There are other North American birds that easily might be added to the list of those now on the road to oblivion; but surely the foregoing citations are sufficient to reveal the present desperate conditions of our bird life in general. Now the question is: What are the great American people going to do about it? THE GRAY SQUIRREL.--The gray squirrel is in danger of extermination. Although it is our most beautiful and companionable small wild animal, and really unfit for food, Americans have strangely elected to class it as ""game,"" and shoot it to death, _to eat_! And this in stall-fed America, in the twentieth century! Americans are the only white people in the world who eat squirrels. It would be just as reasonable, and no more barbarous, to kill domestic cats and eat them. Their flesh would taste quite as good as squirrel flesh and some of them would afford quite as good ""sport."" Every intelligent person knows that in the United States the deadly shot-gun is rapidly exterminating every bird and every small mammal that is classed as ""game,"" and which legally may be killed, even during two months of the twelve. The market gunners slaughter ducks, grouse, shore birds and rabbits as if we were all starving. The beautiful gray squirrel has clung to life in a few of our forests and wood-lots, long after most other wild mammals have disappeared; but throughout at least ninety-five per cent, of its original area, it is now extinct. During the past thirty years I have roamed the woods of my state in several widely separated localities,--the Adirondacks, Catskills, Berkshires, western New York and elsewhere, and in all that time I have seen only _three_ wild gray squirrels outside of city parks. Except over a very small total area, the gray squirrel is already gone from the wild fauna of New York State! Do the well-fed people of America wish to have this beautiful animal entirely exterminated? Do they wish the woods to become wholly lifeless? Or, do they desire to bring back some of the wild creatures, and keep them for their children to enjoy? There is no wild mammal that responds to protection more quickly than the gray squirrel. In two years' time, wild specimens that are set free in city parks learn that they are safe from harm and become almost fearless. They take food from the hands of visitors, and climb into their arms. One of the most pleasing sights of the Zoological Park is the enjoyment of visitors, young and old, in ""petting"" our wild gray squirrels. We ask the Boy Scouts of America to bring back this animal to each state where it belongs, by securing for it from legislatures and governors the perpetual closed seasons that it imperatively needs. It is not much to ask. This can be done by writing to members of the legislatures and requesting a suitable law. Such a request will be both right and reasonable; and three states have already granted it. The gray squirrel is naturally the children's closest wild-animal friend. Surely every farmer boy would like to have colonies of gray squirrels around him, to keep him company, and furnish him with entertainment. A wood-lot without squirrels and chipmunks is indeed a lifeless place. For $20 anyone can restock any bit of woods with the most companionable and most beautiful tree-dweller that nature has given us. The question now is, which will you choose--a gray squirrel colony to every farm, or lifeless desolation? We ask every American to lend a hand to save Silver-Tail. * * * * * CHAPTER IV EXTINCT AND NEARLY EXTINCT SPECIES OF MAMMALS When we pause and consider the years, the generations and the ages that Nature spends in the production of a high vertebrate species, the preservation of such species from extermination should seriously concern us. As a matter of fact, in modern man's wild chase after wealth and pleasure, it is only one person out of every ten thousand who pauses to regard such causes, unless cornered by some protectionist fanatic, held fast and coerced to listen. We are not discussing the animals of the Pleistocene, or the Eocene, or any period of the far-distant Past. We are dealing with species that have been ruthlessly, needlessly and wickedly destroyed by man during our own times; species that, had they been given a fair chance, would be alive and well to-day. In reckless waste of blood and treasure, the nineteenth century has much for which to answer. Wars and pillage, fires, earthquakes and volcanoes are unhappily unavoidable. Like the poor of holy writ, we have them with us always. But the destruction of animal life is in a totally different category from the accidental calamities of life. It is deliberate, cold-blooded, persistent, and in its final stage, _criminal_! Worst of all, there is no limit to the devilish persistence of the confirmed destroyer, this side of the total extinction of species. No polar night is too cold, no desert inferno is too hot for the man who pursues wild life for commercial purposes. The rhytina has been exterminated in the far north, the elephant seals on Kerguelen are being exterminated in the far south, and midway, in the desert mountains of Lower California a fine species of mountain sheep is rapidly being shot into oblivion. * * * * * LARGE MAMMALS COMPLETELY EXTERMINATED THE ARIZONA ELK, (_Cervus merriami_).--Right at our very door, under our very noses and as it were only yesterday, a well-defined species of American elk has been totally exterminated. Until recently the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico were inhabited by a light-colored elk of smaller size than the Wyoming species, whose antlers possessed on each side only one brow tine instead of two. The exact history of the blotting out of that species has not yet been written, but it seems that its final extinction occurred about 1901. Its extermination was only a routine incident of the devilish general slaughter of American big game that by 1900 had wiped out nearly everything killable over a large portion of the Rocky Mountain region and the Great Plains. The Arizona elk was exterminated before the separate standing of the species had been discovered by naturalists, and before even _one_ skin had been preserved in a museum! In 1902 Mr. E.W. Nelson described the species from two male skulls, all the material of which he knew. Since that time, a third male skull, bearing an excellent pair of antlers, has been discovered by Mr. Ferdinand Kaegebehn, a member of the New York Zoological Society, and presented to our National Collection of Heads and Horns. It came from the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, in 1884. The species was first exterminated in the central and northern mountains of Arizona, probably twenty years ago, and made its last stand in northwestern New Mexico. Precisely when it became extinct there, its last abiding place, we do not know, but in time the facts may appear. THE QUAGGA, (_Equus quagga_).--Before the days of Livingstone, Gordon-Cumming and Anderson, the grassy plains and half-forested hills of South Africa were inhabited by great herds of a wild equine species that in its markings was a sort of connecting link between the striped zebras and the stripeless wild asses. The quagga resembled a wild ass with a few zebra stripes around its neck, and no stripes elsewhere. There is no good reason why a mammal that is not in any one of the families regularly eaten by man should be classed as a game animal. White men, outside of the western border of the continent of Europe, do not eat horses; and by this token there is no reason why a zebra should be shot as a ""game"" animal, any more than a baboon. A big male baboon is dangerous; a male zebra is not. Nevertheless, white men have elected to shoot zebras as game; and under this curse the unfortunate quagga fell to rise no more. The species was shot to a speedy death by sportsmen, and by the British and Dutch farmers of South Africa. It became extinct about 1875, and to-day there are only 18 specimens in all the museums of the world. THE BLAUBOK, (_Hippotragus leucophaeus_).--The first of the African antelopes to become extinct in modern times was a species of large size, closely related to the roan antelope of to-day, and named by the early Dutch settlers of Cape Colony the blaubok, which means ""blue-buck."" It was snuffed out of existence in the year 1800, so quickly and so thoroughly that, like the Arizona elk, it very nearly escaped the annals of natural history. According to the careful investigations of Mr. Graham Renshaw, there are only eight specimens in existence in all the museums of Europe. In general terms it may be stated that this species has been extinct for about a century. DAVID'S DEER, (_Elaphurus davidianus_).--We enter this species with those that are totally extinct, because this is true of it so far as its wild state is concerned. It is a deer nearly as large as the red deer of Europe, with 3-tined antlers about equal in total length to those of the red deer. Its most striking differential character is its _long tail_, a feature that among the deer of the world is quite unique. Originally this species inhabited ""northern Mongolia"" (China), but in a wild state it became extinct before its zoological standing became known to the scientific world. The species was called to the attention of zoologists by a Roman Catholic missionary, called Father David, and when finally described it was named in his honor. At the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion, in 1900, there were about 200 specimens living in the imperial park of China, a short distance south of Pekin; but during the rebellion, all of them were killed and eaten, thus totally exterminating the species from Asia. Fortunately, previous to that calamity (in 1894), the Duke of Bedford had by considerable effort and expenditure procured and established in his matchless park surrounding Woburn Abbey, England, a herd of eighteen specimens of this rarest of all deer. That nucleus has thriven and increased, until in 1910 it contained thirty-four head. Owing to the fact that all the living female specimens of this remarkable species are concentrated in one spot, and perfectly liable to be wiped out in one year by riot, war or disease, there is some cause for anxiety. The writer has gone so far as to suggest the desirability of starting a new herd of David's deer, at some point far distant from England, as an insurance measure against the possibility of calamity at Woburn. Excepting two or three specimens in European zoological gardens that have been favored by the Duke of Bedford, there are no living specimens outside of Woburn Park. [Illustration: SKELETON OF A RHYTINA, OR ARCTIC SEA-COW In the United States National Museum] THE RHYTINA, (_Rhytina gigas_).--The most northerly Sirenian that (so far as we know) ever inhabited the earth, lived on the Commander Islands in the northern end of Behring Sea, and was exterminated by man, for its oil and its flesh, about 1768. It was first made known to the world by Steller, in 1741, and must have become extinct near the beginning of the nineteenth century. The rhytina belonged to the same mammalian Order as the manatee of Florida and South America, and the dugong of Australia. The largest manatee that Florida has produced, so far as we know, was thirteen feet long. The rhytina attained a length of between thirty and thirty-five feet, and a weight of 6,000 pounds or over. The flesh of this animal, like that of the manatee and dugong, must have been edible, and surely was prized by the hungry sailors and natives of its time. It is not strange that such a species was quickly exterminated by man, in the arctic regions. The wonder is that it ever existed at a latitude so outrageous for a Sirenian, an animal which by all precedents should prefer life in temperate or warm waters. [Illustration: BURCHELL'S ZEBRA, IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM Now Believed to be Totally Extinct] BURCHELL'S ZEBRA (_Equus burchelli typicus_).--The foundation type of what now is the Burchell group of zebras, consisting of four or five sub-species of the original species of _burchelli_, is an animal abundantly striped as to its body, neck and head, but with legs that are almost white and free from stripes. The sub-species have legs that are striped about half as much as the mountain zebra and the Grevy species. While there are Chapman zebras and Grant zebras in plenty, and of Crawshay's not a few, all these are forms that have developed northward of the range of the parent species, the original _Equus burchelli_. For half a century in South Africa the latter had been harried and driven and shot, and now it is gone, forever. Now, the museum people of the world are hungrily enumerating their mounted specimens, and live ones cannot be procured with money, because there are none! Already it is common talk that ""the true Burchell zebra is extinct;"" and unfortunately there is no good reason to doubt it. Even if there are a few now living in some remote nook of the Transvaal, or Zululand, or Portuguese East Africa, the chances are as 100 to 1 that they will not be suffered to bring back the species; and so, to Burchell's zebra, the world is to-day saying ""Farewell!"" [Illustration: THYLACINE OR TASMANIAN WOLF Now Being Exterminated by the Sheep Owners of Tasmania] * * * * * SPECIES OF LARGE MAMMALS ALMOST EXTINCT THE THYLACINE or TASMANIAN WOLF, (_Thylacinus cynocephalus_).--Four years ago, when Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef, Director of the Melbourne Zoological Garden (Australia), stood before the cage of the living thylacine in the New York Zoological Park, he first expressed surprise at the sight of the animal, then said: ""I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it is gone, you never will get another. The species soon will be extinct."" This opinion has been supported, quite independently, by a lady who is the highest authority on the present status of that species, Mrs. Mary G. Roberts, of Hobart, Tasmania. For nearly ten years Mrs. Roberts has been procuring all the living specimens of the thylacine that money could buy, and attempting to breed them at her private zoo. She states that the mountain home of this animal is now occupied by flocks of sheep, and because of the fact that the ""Tasmanian wolves"" raid the flocks and kill lambs, the sheep-owners and herders are systematically poisoning the thylacines as fast as possible. Inasmuch as the species is limited to Tasmania, Mrs. Roberts and others fear that the sheepmen will totally exterminate the remnant at an early date. This animal is the largest and also the most interesting carnivorous marsupial of Australia, and its untimely end will be a cause for sincere regret. [Illustration: WEST INDIAN SEAL In the New York Aquarium] THE WEST INDIAN SEAL, (_Monachus tropicalis_).--For at least fifty years, all the zoologists who ever had heard of this species believed that the oil-hunters had completely exterminated it. In 1885, when the National Museum came into possession of one poorly-mounted skin, from Professor Poey, of Havana, it was regarded as a great _prize_. Most unexpectedly, in 1886 American zoologists were startled by the discovery of a small herd on the Triangle Islands, in the Caribbean Sea, near Yucatan, by Mr. Henry L. Ward, now director of the Milwaukee Public Museum, and Professor Ferrari, of the National Museum of Mexico. They found about twenty specimens, and collected only a sufficient number to establish the true character of the species. Since that time, four living specimens have been captured, and sent to the New York Aquarium, where they lived for satisfactory periods. The indoor life and atmosphere did not seem to injure the natural vitality of the animals. In fact, I think they were far more lively in the Aquarium than were the sluggish creatures that Mr. Ward saw on the Triangle reefs, and described in his report of the expedition. It is quite possible that there are yet alive a few specimens of this odd species; but the Damocletian sword of destruction hangs over them suspended by a fine hair, and it is to be expected that in the future some roving sea adventurer will pounce upon the Remnant, and wipe it out of existence for whatever reason may to him seem good. [Illustration: CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL Photographed on Guadalupe Island by C.H. Townsend.] THE CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL, (_Mirounga angustirostris_).--This remarkable long-snouted species of seal was reluctantly stricken from the fauna of the United States several years ago, and for at least fifteen years it has been regarded as totally extinct. Last year, however (1911), the _Albatross_ scientific expedition, under the control of Director C.H. Townsend of the New York Aquarium, visited Guadalupe Island, 175 miles off the Pacific coast of Lower California and there found about 150 living elephant seals. They took six living specimens, all of which died after a few months in captivity. Ever since that time, first one person and then another comes to the front with a cheerful proposition to go to those islands and ""clean up"" all the remainder of those wonderful seals. One hunting party could land on Guadalupe, and in one week totally destroy the last remnant of this almost extinct species. To-day the only question is, Who will be mean enough to do it? Fortunately, those seals have no commercial value whatsoever. The little oil they would yield would not pay the wages of cook's mate. The proven impossibility of keeping specimens alive in captivity, even for one year, and the absence of cash value in the skins, even for museum purposes, has left nothing of value in the animals to justify an expedition to kill or to capture them. No zoological garden or park desires any of them, at any price. Adult males attain a length of sixteen feet, and females eleven feet. Formerly this species was abundant in San Christobal Bay, Lower California. At present, Mexico is in no frame of mind to provide real protection to a small colony of seals of no commercial value, 175 miles from her mainland, on an uninhabited island. It is wildly improbable that those seals will be permitted to live. It is a safe prediction that our next news of the elephant seals of Guadalupe will tell of the total extinction of those last 140 survivors of the species. THE CALIFORNIA GRIZZLY BEAR, (_Ursus horribilis californicus_).--No one protects grizzly bears, except in the Yellowstone Park and other game preserves. For obvious reasons, it is impossible to say whether any individuals of this huge species now remain alive, or how long it will be until the last one falls before a .405 Winchester engine of extermination. We know that a living specimen can not be procured with money, and we believe that ""Old Monarch"" now in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, is the last specimen of his species that ever will be exhibited alive. I can think of no reason, save general Californian apathy, why the extinction of this huge and remarkable animal was not prevented by law. The sunset grizzly (on a railroad track) is the advertising emblem of the Golden State, and surely the state should take sufficient interest in the species to prevent its total extermination. But it will not. California is hell-bent on exterminating a long list of her wild-life species, and it is very doubtful whether the masses can be reached and aroused in time to stop it. Name some of the species? Certainly; with all the pleasure in life: The band-tailed pigeon, the white-tailed kite, the sharp-tailed grouse, the sage grouse, the mountain sheep, prong-horned antelope, California mule deer, and ducks and geese too numerous to mention. * * * * * CHAPTER V THE EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES, STATE BY STATE Early in 1912 I addressed to about 250 persons throughout the United States, three questions, as follows: 1. What species of birds have become totally extinct in your state? 2. What species of birds and mammals are threatened with early extinction? 3. What species of mammals have been exterminated throughout your state? These queries were addressed to persons whose tastes and observations rendered them especially qualified to furnish the information desired. The interest shown in the inquiry was highly gratifying. The best of the information given is summarized below; but this tabulation also includes much information acquired from other sources. The general summary of the subject will, I am sure, convince all thoughtful persons that the present condition of the best wild life of the nation is indeed very grave. This list is not submitted as representing prolonged research or absolute perfection, but it is sufficient to point forty-eight morals. * * * * * BIRDS AND MAMMALS THAT HAVE BEEN TOTALLY EXTERMINATED IN VARIOUS STATES AND PROVINCES ALABAMA: Passenger pigeon, Carolina parrakeet; puma, elk, gray wolf, beaver.

A strange condition exists in Minnesota, as will be seen by reference to the next list of states. A great many species are on the road to speedy extermination; but as yet the number of those that have become totally extinct up to date is small. MISSISSIPPI: Parrakeet, passenger pigeon; bison. (Data incomplete.) MISSOURI: Parrakeet, ivory-billed woodpecker, passenger pigeon, whooping crane, pinnated grouse; bison, elk, beaver. MONTANA: Although many Montana birds are on the verge of extinction, the only species that we are sure have totally vanished are the passenger pigeon and whooping crane. Mammals extinct, bison. NEBRASKA: Curlew, wild turkey, parrakeet, passenger pigeon, whooping crane, and no doubt _all_ the other species that have disappeared from Kansas. Mammals: bison, antelope, elk, and mule deer. NEVADA: By a rather odd combination of causes and effects, Nevada retains representatives of nearly all her original outfit of bird and mammal species except the bison and elk; but several of them will shortly become extinct. NEW HAMPSHIRE: Wild turkey, heath hen, pigeon, whooping crane, Eskimo curlew, upland plover, Labrador duck; woodland caribou, moose. NEW JERSEY: Heath hen, wild turkey, pigeon, parrakeet, Eskimo curlew, Labrador duck, snowy egret, whooping crane, sandhill crane, trumpeter swan, pileated woodpecker; gray wolf, black bear, beaver, elk, porcupine, puma. NEW MEXICO: Notwithstanding an enormous decrease in the general volume of wild life in New Mexico, comparatively few species have been totally exterminated. The most important are the bison and Arizona elk. NEW YORK: Heath hen, passenger pigeon, wild turkey, great auk, trumpeter swan, Labrador duck, harlequin duck, Eskimo curlew, upland plover, golden plover, whooping crane, sandhill crane, purple martin, pileated woodpecker, moose, caribou, bison, elk, puma, gray wolf, wolverine, marten, fisher, beaver, fox, squirrel, harbor seal. NORTH CAROLINA: Ivory-billed woodpecker, parrakeet, pigeon, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew (_Numenius americanus_), Eskimo curlew; bison, elk, gray wolf, puma, beaver.--(E.L. Ewbank, T. Gilbert Pearson, H.H. and C.S. Brimley.) NORTH DAKOTA: Whooping crane, long-billed curlew, Hudsonian godwit, passenger pigeon; bison, elk, mule deer, mountain sheep.--(W.B. Bell and Alfred Eastgate.) OHIO: Pigeon, wild turkey, pinnated grouse, northern pileated woodpecker, parrakeet; white-tailed deer, bison, elk, black bear, puma, gray wolf, beaver, otter, puma, lynx. OKLAHOMA: Records for birds insufficient. Mammals: bison, elk, antelope, mule deer, puma, black bear. OREGON: The only species known to have been wholly exterminated during recent times is the California condor and the bison, both of which were rare stragglers into Oregon; but a number of species are now close to extinction. PENNSYLVANIA: Heath hen, pigeon, parrakeet, Labrador duck; bison, elk, moose, puma, gray wolf, Canada lynx, wolverine, beaver.--(Witmer Stone, Dr. C.B. Penrose and Arthur Chapman.) RHODE ISLAND: Heath hen, passenger pigeon, wild turkey, least tern, eastern willet, Eskimo curlew, marbled godwit, long-billed curlew.--(Harry S. Hathaway); puma, black bear, gray wolf, beaver, otter, wolverine. SOUTH CAROLINA: Ivory-billed woodpecker, Carolina parrakeet; bison, elk, puma, gray wolf.--(James H. Rice, Jr.) SOUTH DAKOTA: Whooping crane, trumpeter swan, pigeon, long-billed curlew; bison, elk, mule deer, mountain sheep. TENNESSEE: Records insufficient. TEXAS: Wild turkey, passenger pigeon, ivory-billed woodpecker, flamingo, roseate spoonbill, American egret, whooping crane, wood-duck; bison, elk, mountain sheep, antelope, ""a small, dark deer that lived 40 years ago."" (Capt. M.B. Davis.) UTAH: Records insufficient. VIRGINIA: Records insufficient. WASHINGTON: Very few species have become totally extinct, but a number are on the verge, and will be named in the next state schedule. WEST VIRGINIA: Pigeon, parrakeet; bison, elk, beaver, puma, gray wolf. WISCONSIN: Whooping crane, passenger pigeon, American egret, wild turkey, Carolina parrakeet; bison, moose, elk, woodland caribou, puma, wolverine. WYOMING: Whooping crane, trumpeter swan, wood-duck; mountain goat. CANADA ALBERTA: Passenger pigeon, whooping crane; bison. BRITISH COLUMBIA: A. Bryan Williams reports: ""Do not know of any birds having become extinct."" MANITOBA: Pigeon; bison, antelope, gray wolf. NEW BRUNSWICK: Pigeon. NOVA SCOTIA: Labrador duck, Eskimo curlew, passenger pigeon. ONTARIO: Wild turkey, pigeon, Eskimo curlew. PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND: (Reported by E.T. Carbonell): Eskimo curlew, horned grebe, ring-billed gull, Caspian tern, passenger pigeon, Wilson's petrel, wood-duck, Barrow's golden-eye, whistling swan, American eider, white-fronted goose, purple sandpiper, Canada grouse, long-eared owl, screech owl, black-throated bunting, pine warbler, red-necked grebe, purple martin and catbird; beaver, black fox, silver gray fox, marten and black bear. QUEBEC: Pigeon. SASKATCHEWAN: Pigeon; bison. * * * * * BIRDS AND MAMMALS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION The second question submitted in my inquiry produced results even more startling than the first. None of the persons reporting can be regarded as alarmists, but some of the lists of species approaching extinction are appallingly long. To their observations I add other notes and observations of interest at this time. ALABAMA: Wood-duck, snowy egret, woodcock. ""The worst enemy of wild life is the pot-hunter and game hog. These wholesale slaughterers of game resort to any device and practice, it matters not how murderous, to accomplish the pernicious ends of their nefarious campaign of relentless extermination of fur and feather. They cannot be controlled by local laws, for these after having been tried for several generations have proven consummate failures, for the reason that local authorities will not enforce the provisions of game and bird protective statutes. Experience has demonstrated the fact that no one desires to inform voluntarily on his neighbors, and since breaking the game law is not construed to involve moral turpitude, even to an infinitesimal degree, by many of our citizens, the plunderers of nature's storehouse thus go free, it matters not how great the damage done to the people as a whole.""--(John H. Wallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of Alabama.) ALASKA: Thanks to geographic and climatic conditions, the Alaskan game laws and $15,000 with which to enforce them, the status of the wild life of Alaska is fairly satisfactory. I think that at present no species is in danger of extinction in the near future. When it was pointed out to Congress in 1902, by Madison Grant, T.S. Palmer and others that the wild life of Alaska was seriously threatened, Congress immediately enacted the law that was recommended, and now appropriates yearly a fair sum for its enforcement. I regard the Alaskan situation as being, for so vast and difficult a region, reasonably well in hand, even though open to improvement. There is one fatal defect in our Alaskan game law, in the perpetual and sweeping license to kill, that is bestowed upon ""natives"" and ""prospectors."" Under cover of this law, the Indians can slaughter game to any extent they choose; and they are great killers. For example: In 1911 at Sand Point, Kenai Peninsula, Frank E. Kleinchmidt saw 82 caribou tongues in the boat of a native, that had been brought in for sale at 50 cents, while the carcasses were left where they fell, to poison the air of Alaska. Thanks to the game law, and five wardens, the number of big game animals killed last year in Alaska by sportsmen was reasonably small,--just as it should have been.--(W.T.H.) ARIZONA: During an overland trip made by Dr. MacDougal and others in 1907 from Tucson to Sonoyta, on the international boundary, 150 miles and back again, we saw not one antelope or deer.--(W.T.H.) CALIFORNIA: Swan, white heron, bronze ibis. California valley quail are getting very scarce, and unless adequate protection is afforded them shortly, they will be found hereafter only in remote districts. Ducks also are decreasing rapidly.--(H.W. Keller, Los Angeles.) Sage grouse and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse are so nearly extinct that it may practically be said that they _are_ extinct. Among species likely to be exterminated in the near future are the wood-duck and band-tailed pigeon.--(W.P. Taylor, Berkeley.) COLORADO: Sage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse; nearly all the shore birds. CONNECTICUT: All the shore birds; quail, purple martin. DELAWARE: Wood duck, upland plover, least tern, Wilson tern, roseate tern, black skimmer, oystercatcher, and numerous other littoral species. Pileated woodpeckers, bald eagles and all the ducks are much more rare than formerly. Swan are about gone, geese scarce. The list of ducks, geese and shore-birds, as well as of terns and gulls that are nearing extinction is appalling.--(C.J. Pennock, Wilmington.) Wood-duck, woodcock, turtle dove and bob-white.--(A.R. Spaid, Wilmington.) FLORIDA: Limpkin, ivory-billed woodpecker, wild turkey (?). GEORGIA: Ruffed grouse, wild turkey. IDAHO: Harlequin duck, mountain plover, dusky grouse, Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, sage grouse. Elk, goats and grizzly bears are becoming very scarce. Of the smaller animals I have not seen a fisher for years, and marten are hardly to be found. The same is true of other species.--(Dr. Charles S. Moody, Sand Point.) ILLINOIS: Pinnated grouse, except where rigidly protected. In Vermillion County, by long and persistent protection Harvey J. Sconce has bred back upon his farm about 400 of these birds. INDIANA: Pileated woodpecker, woodcock, ruffed grouse, pigeon hawk, duck hawk.--(Amos W. Butler, Indianapolis.) In northern and northwestern Indiana, a perpetual close season and rigid protection have enabled the almost-extinct pinnated grouse to breed up to a total number now estimated by Game Commissioner Miles and his wardens at 10,000 birds. This is a gratifying illustration of what can be done in bringing back an almost-vanished species. The good example of Indiana should be followed by every state that still possesses a remnant of prairie-chickens, or other grouse. IOWA: Pinnated grouse, wood-duck. Notwithstanding an invasion of Jasper County, Iowa, in the winter of 1911-12 by hundreds of pinnated grouse, such as had not been known in 20 years, this gives no ground to hope that the future of the species is worth a moment's purchase. The winter migration came from the Dakotas, and was believed to be due to the extra severe winter, and the scarcity of food. Commenting on this unprecedented occurrence, J.L. Sloanaker in the ""Wilson Bulletin"" No. 78, says: ""In the opinion of many, the formerly abundant prairie chicken is doomed to early extinction. Many will testify to their abundance in those years [in South Dakota, 1902] when the great land movement was taking place. The influx of hungry settlers, together with an occasional bad season, decimated their ranks. They were eaten by the farmers, both in and out of season. Driven from pillar to post, with no friends and insufficient food,--what else then can be expected?"" Mr. F.C. Pellett, of Atlantic, Iowa, says: ""Unless ways can be devised of rearing these birds in the domestic state, the prairie hen in my opinion is doomed to early extinction."" The older inhabitants here say that there is not one song-bird in summer where there used to be ten.--(G.H. Nicol, in _Outdoor Life_ March, 1912.) KANSAS: To all of those named in my previous list that are not actually extinct, I might add the prairie hen, the lesser prairie hen, as well as the prairie sharp-tailed grouse and the wood-duck. Such water birds as the avocets, godwits, greater yellow-legs, long-billed curlew and Eskimo curlew are becoming very rare. All the water birds that are killed as game birds have been greatly reduced in numbers during the past 25 years. I have not seen a wood-duck in 5 years. _The prairie chicken_ has entirely disappeared from this locality. A few are still seen in the sand hills of western Kansas, and they are still comparatively abundant along the extreme southwestern line, and in northern Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle.--(C.H. Smyth, Wichita.) Yellow-legged plover, golden plover; Hudsonian and Eskimo curlew, prairie chicken.--(James Howard, Wichita.) LOUISIANA: Ivory-billed woodpecker, butterball, bufflehead. The wood-duck is greatly diminishing every year, and if not completely protected, ten years hence no wood-duck will be found in Louisiana.--(Frank M. Miller, and G.E. Beyer, New Orleans.) Ivory-billed woodpecker, sandhill crane, whooping crane, pinnated grouse, American and snowy egret where unprotected.--(E.A. McIlhenny, Avery Island.) MAINE: Wood-duck, upland plover, purple martin, house wren, pileated woodpecker, bald eagle, yellow-legs, great blue heron, Canada goose, redhead and canvasback duck.--(John F. Sprague, Dover.) Puffin, Leach's petrel, eider duck, laughing gull, great blue heron, fish-hawk and bald eagle.--(Arthur H. Norton, Portland.) MARYLAND: Curlew, pileated woodpecker, summer duck, snowy heron. No record of sandhill crane for the last 35 years. Greater yellow-leg is much scarcer than formerly, also Bartramian sandpiper. The only two birds which show an _increase_ in the past few years are the robin and lesser scaup. General protection of the robin has caused its increase; stopping of spring shooting in the North has probably caused the increase of the latter. As a general proposition I think I can say that all birds are becoming scarcer in this state, as we have laws that do not protect, little enforcement of same, no revenue for bird protection and too little public interest. We are working to change all this, but it comes slowly. _The public fails to respond until the birds are 'most gone_, and we have a pretty good lot of game still left. The members of the Order Gallinae are only holding their own where privately protected. The members of the Plover Family and what are known locally as shore birds are still plentiful on the shores of Chincoteague and Assateague, and although they do not breed there as formerly, so far as I know there are no species exterminated.--(Talbott Denmead, Baltimore.) MASSACHUSETTS: Wood-duck, hooded merganser, blue-winged teal, upland plover; curlew (perhaps already gone); red-tailed hawk (I have not seen one in Middlesex County for several years); great horned owl (almost gone in my county, Middlesex); house wren. The eave swallows and purple martins are fast deserting eastern Massachusetts and the barn swallows steadily diminishing in numbers. The bald eagle should perhaps be included here. I seldom see or hear of it now.--(William Brewster, Cambridge.) Upland plover, woodcock, wood-duck (recent complete protection is helping these somewhat), heath hen, piping plover, golden plover, a good many song and insectivorous birds are apparently decreasing rather rapidly; for instance, the eave swallow.--(William P. Wharton, Groton.) MICHIGAN: Wood-duck, limicolae, woodcock, sandhill crane. The great whooping crane is not a wild bird, but I think it is now practically extinct. Many of our warblers and song birds are now exceedingly rare. Ruffed grouse greatly decreased during the past 10 years.--(W.B. Mershon, Saginaw.) MINNESOTA: The sandhill crane has been killed by sportsmen. I have not seen one in three years. Where there were, a few years ago, thousands of blue herons, egrets, wood ducks, redbirds, and Baltimore orioles, all those birds are now almost extinct in this state. They are being killed by Austrians and Italians, who slaughter everything that flies or moves. Robins, too, will be a rarity if more severe penalties are not imposed. I have seized 22 robins, 1 pigeon hawk, 1 crested log-cock, 4 woodpeckers and 1 grosbeak in one camp, at the Lertonia mine, all being prepared for eating. I have also caught them preparing and eating sea gulls, terns, blue heron, egret and even the bittern. I have secured 128 convictions since the first of last September.--(George E. Wood, Game Warden, Hibbing, Minnesota.) From Robert Page Lincoln, Minneapolis.--Partridge are waning fast, quail gradually becoming extinct, prairie chickens almost extinct. Duck-shooting is rare. The gray squirrel is fast becoming extinct in Minnesota. Mink are going fast, and fur-bearing animals generally are becoming extinct. The game is passing so very rapidly that it will soon be a thing of the forgotten past. The quail are suffering most. The falling off is amazing, and inconceivable to one who has not looked it up. Duck-shooting is rare, the clubs are idle for want of birds. What ducks come down fly high, being harassed coming down from the north. I consider the southern Minnesota country practically cleaned out. MISSOURI: The birds threatened with extermination are the American woodcock, wood-duck, snowy egret, pinnated grouse, wild turkey, ruffed grouse, golden eagle, bald eagle, pileated woodpecker. MONTANA: Blue grouse.--(Henry Avare, Helena.) Sage grouse, prairie and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, trumpeter swan, Canada goose, in fact, most of the water-fowl. The sickle-billed curlew, of which there were many a few years ago, is becoming scarce. There are no more golden or black-bellied plover in these parts.--(Harry P. Stanford, Kalispell.) Curlew, Franklin grouse (fool hen) and sage grouse.--W.R. Felton, Miles City. Sage grouse.--(L.A. Huffman, Miles City.) Ptarmigan, wood-duck, sharp-tailed grouse, sage grouse, fool hen and plover. All game birds are becoming scarce as the country becomes settled and they are confined to uninhabited regions.--(Prof. M.J. Elrod, Missoula.) NEBRASKA: Grouse, prairie chicken and quail.--(H.N. Miller, Lincoln.) Whistling swan.--(Dr. S.G. Towne, Omaha.) NEW HAMPSHIRE: Wood-duck and upland plover. NEW YORK: Quail, woodcock, upland plover, golden plover, black-bellied plover, willet, dowitcher, red-breasted sandpiper, long-billed curlew, wood-duck, purple martin, redheaded woodpecker, mourning dove; gray squirrel, otter. NEW JERSEY: Ruffed grouse, teal, canvasback, red-head duck, widgeon, and all species of shore birds, the most noticeable being black-bellied plover, dowitcher, golden plover, killdeer, sickle-bill curlew, upland plover and English snipe; also the mourning dove.--(James M. Stratton and Ernest Napier, Trenton.) Upland plover, apparently killdeer, egret, wood-duck, woodcock, and probably others.--(B.S. Bowdish, Demarest.) NORTH CAROLINA: Forster's tern, oystercatcher, egret and snowy egret.--(T. Gilbert Pearson, Sec. Nat. Asso. Audubon Societies.) Ruffed grouse rapidly disappearing; bobwhite becoming scarce.--(E.L. Ewbank, Hendersonville.) Perhaps American and snowy egret. If long-billed curlew is not extinct, it seems due to become so. No definite, reliable record of it later than 1885.--(H.H. Brimley, Raleigh.) NORTH DAKOTA: Wood-duck, prairie hen, upland plover, sharp-tailed grouse, canvas-back, pinnated and ruffed grouse, double-crested cormorant, blue heron, long-billed curlew, whooping crane and white pelican.--(W.B. Bell, Agricultural College.) Upland plover, marbled godwit, Baird's sparrow, chestnut-collared longspur.--(Alfred Eastgate, Tolna.) OHIO: White heron, pileated woodpecker (if not already extinct). White heron reported a number of times last year; occurrences in Sandusky, Huron, Ashtabula and several other counties during 1911. These birds would doubtless rapidly recruit under a proper federal law.--(Paul North, Cleveland.) Turtle dove, quail, red-bird, wren, hummingbird, wild canary [goldfinch] and blue bird.--(Walter C. Staley, Dayton.) OKLAHOMA: Pinnated grouse.--(J.C. Clark); otter, kit fox, black-footed ferret.--(G.W. Stevens.) OREGON: American egret, snowy egret.--(W.L. Finley, Portland.) PENNSYLVANIA: Virginia partridge and woodcock.--(Arthur Chapman.) Wood-duck, least bittern, phalarope, woodcock, duck hawk and barn swallow.--(Dr. Chas. B. Penrose.) Wild turkey; also various transient and straggling water birds.--(Witmer Stone.) RHODE ISLAND: Wood-duck, knot, greater yellow-legs, upland plover, golden plover, piping plover, great horned owl.--(Harry S. Hathaway, South Auburn.) SOUTH CAROLINA: Wood duck, abundant 6 years ago, now almost gone. Wild turkey (abundant up to 1898); woodcock, upland plover, Hudsonian curlew, Carolina rail, Virginia rail, clapper rail and coot. Black bear verging on extinction, opossum dwindling rapidly.--(James H. Rice Jr., Summerville.) SOUTH DAKOTA: Prairie chicken and quail are most likely to become extinct in the near future.--(W.F. Bancroft, Watertown.) TEXAS: Wild turkey and prairie chickens.--(J.D. Cox, Austin.) Plover, all species; curlew, cardinal, road-runner, woodcock, wood-duck, canvas-back, cranes, all the herons; wild turkey; quail, all varieties; prairie chicken and Texas guan.--(Capt. M.B. Davis, Waco.) Curlew, very rare; plover, very rare; antelope. (Answer applies to the Panhandle of Texas.--Chas. Goodnight.) Everything [is threatened with extinction] save the dove, which is a migrating bird. Antelope nearly all gone.--(Col. O.C. Guessaz, San Antonio.) UTAH: Our wild birds are well protected, and there are none that are threatened with extinction. They are increasing.--(Fred. W. Chambers, State Game Warden, Salt Lake City.) VERMONT: If all states afforded as good protection as does Vermont, none; but migrating birds like woodcock are now threatened.--(John W. Tilcomb, State Game Warden, Lyndonville.) VIRGINIA: Pheasants (ruffed grouse), wild turkey and other game birds are nearly extinct. A few bears remain, and deer in small numbers in remote sections. In fact, all animals show great reduction in numbers, owing to cutting down forests, and constant gunning.--(L.T. Christian, Richmond.) WEST VIRGINIA: Wood-duck, wild turkey, northern raven, dickcissel.--(Rev. Earle A. Brooks, Weston.) Wild turkeys are very scarce, also ducks. Doves, once numerous, now almost _nil_. Eagles, except a few in remote fastnesses. Many native song-birds are retreating before the English sparrow.--(William Perry Brown, Glenville.) Wood-duck and wild turkey.--(J.A. Viquesney, Belington.) WISCONSIN: Double-crested cormorant, upland plover, white pelican, long-billed curlew, lesser snow goose, Hudsonian curlew, sandhill crane, golden plover, woodcock, dowitcher and long-billed duck; spruce grouse, knot, prairie sharp-tailed grouse, marbled godwit and bald eagle. All these, formerly abundant, must now be called rare in Wisconsin.--(Prof. George E. Wagner, Madison.) Common tern, knot, American white pelican, Hudsonian godwit, trumpeter swan, long-billed curlew, snowy heron, Hudsonian curlew, American avocet, prairie sharp-tailed grouse, dowitcher, passenger pigeon. Long-billed dowitcher and northern hairy woodpecker.--(Henry L. Ward, Milwaukee Public Museum.) Wood-duck, ruddy duck, black mallard, grebe or hell-diver, tern and woodcock.--(Fred. Gerhardt, Madison.) WYOMING: Sage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are becoming extinct, both in Wyoming and North Dakota. Sheridan and Johnson Counties (Wyoming) have sage grouse protected until 1915. The miners (mostly foreigners) are out after rabbits at all seasons. To them everything that flies, walks or swims, large enough to be seen, is a ""rabbit."" They are even worse than the average sheep-herder, as he will seldom kill a bird brooding her young, but to one of those men, a wren or creeper looks like a turkey. Antelope, mountain sheep and grizzly bears are _going_, fast! The moose season opens in 1915, for a 30 days open season, then close season until 1920.--(Howard Eaton, Wolf.) Sage grouse, blue grouse, curlew, sandhill crane, porcupine practically extinct; wolverine and pine marten nearly all gone.--(S.N. Leek, Jackson's Hole.) CANADA ALBERTA: Swainson's buzzard and sandhill crane are now practically extinct. Elk and antelope will soon be as extinct as the buffalo.--(Arthur G. Wooley-Dod, Calgary.) BRITISH COLUMBIA: Wild fowl are in the greatest danger in the southern part of the Province, especially the wood-duck. Otherwise birds are increasing rather than otherwise, especially the small non-game birds. The sea otter is almost extinct.--(A. Bryan Williams, Provincial Game Warden, Vancouver.) MANITOBA: Whooping crane, wood-duck and golden plover. Other species begin to show a marked increase, due to our stringent protective measures. For example, the pinnated grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are more plentiful than in 15 years. Prong-horned antelope and wolf are threatened with extinction.--(J.P. Turner, Winnipeg.) The game birds indigenous to this Province are fairly plentiful. Though the prairie chicken was very scarce some few years ago, these birds have become very plentiful again, owing to the strict enforcement of our present ""Game Act."" The elk are in danger of becoming extinct if they are not stringently guarded. Beaver and otter were almost extinct some few years ago, but are now on the increase, owing to a strict enforcement of the ""Game Act.""--(Charles Barber, Winnipeg.) NEW BRUNSWICK: Partridge, plover and woodcock. Moose and deer are getting more plentiful every year.--(W.W. Gerard, St. John.) NOVA SCOTIA: The Canada grouse may possibly become extinct in Nova Scotia, unless the protection it now enjoys can save it. The American golden plover, which formerly came in immense flocks, is now very rare. Snowflakes are very much less common than formerly, but I think this is because our winters are now usually much less severe. The caribou is almost extinct on the mainland of Nova Scotia, but is still found in North Cape Breton Island. The wolf has become excessively rare, but as it is found in New Brunswick, it may occur here at any time again. The beaver had been threatened with extinction; but since being protected, it has multiplied, and is now on a fairly safe footing again.--(Curator of Museum, Halifax.) ONTARIO: Quail are getting scarce.--(E. Tinsley, Toronto.) Wood-duck, bob white, woodcock, golden plover, Hudsonian curlew, knot and dowitcher [are threatened with extinction.]--(C.W. Nash, Toronto.) PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND: The species threatened with extinction are the golden plover, American woodcock, pied-billed grebe, red-throated loon, sooty shearwater, gadwall, ruddy duck, black-crowned night heron, Hudsonian godwit, kildeer, northern pileated woodpecker, chimney swift, yellow-bellied flycatcher, red-winged blackbird, pine finch, magnolia warbler, ruby-crowned kinglet.--(E.T. Carbonell, Charlottetown.) In closing the notes of this survey, I repeat my assurance that they are not offered on a basis of infallibility. It would require years of work to obtain answers from forty-eight states to the three questions that I have asked that could be offered as absolutely exact. All these reports are submitted on the well-recognized court-testimony basis,--""to the best of our knowledge and belief."" Gathered as they have been from persons whose knowledge is good, these opinions are therefore valuable; and they furnish excellent indices of wild-life conditions as they exist in 1912 in the various states and provinces of North America north of Mexico. * * * * * CHAPTER VI THE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION In order to cure any disease, the surgeon must make of it a correct diagnosis. It is useless to try to prescribe remedies without a thorough understanding of the trouble. That the best and most interesting wild life of America is disappearing at a rapid rate, we all know only too well. That proposition is entirely beyond the domain of argument. The fact that a species or a group of species has made a little gain here and there, or is stationary, does not sensibly diminish the force of the descending blow. The wild-life situation is full of surprises. For example, in 1902 I was astounded by the extent to which bird life had decreased over the 130 miles between Miles City, Montana, and the Missouri River since 1886; for there was no reason to expect anything of the kind. Even the jack rabbits and coyotes had almost totally disappeared. The duties of the present hour, that fairly thrust themselves into our faces and will not be put aside, are these: _First_,--To save valuable species from extermination! _Second_,--To preserve a satisfactory representation of our once rich fauna, to hand down to Posterity. _Third_,--To protect the farmer and fruit grower from the enormous losses that the destruction of our insectivorous and rodent-eating birds is now inflicting upon both the producer and consumer. _Fourth_,--To protect our forests, by protecting the birds that keep down the myriads of insects that are destructive to trees and shrubs. _Fifth_,--To preserve to the future sportsmen of America enough game and fish that they may have at least a taste of the legitimate pursuit of game in the open that has made life so interesting to the sportsmen of to-day. For any civilized nation to exterminate valuable and interesting species of wild mammals, birds or fishes is more than a disgrace. It is a crime! We have no right, legal, moral or commercial, to exterminate any valuable or interesting species; because none of them belong to us, to exterminate or not, as we please. For the people of any civilized nation to permit the slaughter of the wild birds that protect its crops, its fruits and its forests from the insect hordes, is worse than folly. It is sheer orneryness and idiocy. People who are either so lazy or asinine as to permit the slaughter of their best friends deserve to have their crops destroyed and their forests ravaged. They deserve to pay twenty cents a pound for their cotton when the boll weevil has cut down the normal supply. It is very desirable that we should now take an inventory of the forces that have been, and to-day are, active in the destruction of our wild birds, mammals, and game fishes. During the past ten years a sufficient quantity of facts and figures has become available to enable us to secure a reasonably full and accurate view of the whole situation. As we pause on our hill-top, and survey the field of carnage, we find that we are reviewing the _Army of Destruction_! It is indeed a motley array. We see true sportsmen beside ordinary gunners, game-hogs and meat hunters; handsome setter dogs are mixed up with coyotes, cats, foxes and skunks; and well-gowned women and ladies' maids are jostled by half-naked ""poor-white"" and black-negro ""plume hunters."" Verily, the destruction of wild life makes strange companions. Let us briefly review the several army corps that together make up the army of the destroyers. Space in this volume forbids an extended notice of each. Unfortunately it is impossible to segregate some of these classes, and number each one, for they merge together too closely for that; but we can at least describe the several classes that form the great mass of destroyers. THE GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN.--These men are the very bone and sinew of wild life preservation. These are the men who have red blood in their veins, who annually hear the red gods calling, who love the earth, the mountains, the woods, the waters and the sky. These are the men to whom ""the bag"" is a matter of small importance, and to whom ""the bag-limit"" has only academic interest; because in nine cases out of ten they do not care to kill all that the law allows. The tenth and exceptional time is when the bag limit is ""one."" A gentleman sportsman is a man who protects game, stops shooting when he has ""enough""--without reference to the legal bag-limit, and whenever a species is threatened with extinction, he conscientiously refrains from shooting it. The true sportsmen of the world are the men who once were keen in the stubble or on the trail, but who have been halted by the general slaughter and the awful decrease of game. Many of them, long before a hair has turned gray, have hung up their guns forever, and turned to the camera. These are the men who are willing to hand out checks, or to leave their mirth and their employment and go to the firing line at their state capitols, to lock horns with the bull-headed killers of wild life who recognize no check or limit save the law. These are the men who have done the most to put upon our statute books the laws that thus far have saved some of our American game from total annihilation, and who (so we firmly believe) will be chiefly instrumental in tightening the lines of protection around the remnant. These are the men who are making and stocking game preserves, public and private, great and small. [Illustration: THE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION, WAITING FOR THE FIRST OF OCTOBER Each Year 2,642,274 Well-Armed Men Take the Field Against the Remnant of Wild Birds and Mammals In the United States. Drawn by Dan Beard] If you wish to know some of these men, I will tell you where to find a goodly number of them; and when you find them, you will also find that they are men you would enjoy camping with! Look in the membership lists of the Boone and Crockett Club, Camp-Fire Club of America, the Lewis and Clark Club of Pittsburgh, the New York State League, the Shikar Club of London, the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the British Empire, the Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association, the Springfield (Mass.) Sportsmen's Association, the Camp-Fire Clubs of Detroit and Chicago, and the North American Fish and Game Protective Association. There are other bodies of sportsmen that I would like to name, were space available, but to set down here a complete list is quite impossible. The best and the most of the game-protective laws now in force in the United States and Canada were brought into existence through the initiative and efforts of the real sportsmen of those two nations. But for their activity, exerted on the right side, the settled portion of North America would to-day be an utterly gameless land! Even though the sportsmen have taken their toll of the wilds, they have made the laws that have saved a remnant of the game until 1912. For all that, however, every man who still shoots game is a soldier in the Army of Destruction! There is no blinking that fact. Such men do not stand on the summit with the men who now protect the game _and do not shoot at all!_ The millions of men who do not shoot, and who also _do nothing to protect or preserve wild life_, do not count! In this warfare they are merely ciphers in front of the real figures. THE GUNNERS, WHO KILL TO THE LIMIT.--Out of the enormous mass of men who annually take up arms against the remnant of wild life, _and are called ""sportsmen_,"" I believe that only one out of every 500 _conscientiously_ stops shooting when game becomes scarce, and extinction is impending. All of the others feel that it is right and proper to kill all the game that they can kill _up to the legal bag limit_. It is the reasoning of Shylock: ""Justice demands it, and _the law_ doth give it!"" Especially is this true of the men who pay their _one dollar_ per year for a resident hunting license, and feel that in doing so they have done a great Big Thing! This is a very deadly frame of mind. Ethically it is _entirely wrong_; and at least two million men and boys who shoot American game must be shown that it is wrong! This is the spirit of Extermination, clothed in the robes of Law and Justice. Whenever and wherever game birds are so scarce that a good shot who hunts hard during a day in the fields finds only three or four birds, he should _stop shooting at once, and devote his mind and energies to the problem of bringing back the game!_ It is strange that conditions do not make this duty clear to every conscientious citizen. The Shylock spirit which prompts a man to kill all that ""the law allows"" is a terrible scourge to the wild life of America, and to the world at large. It is the spirit of extermination according to law. Even the killing of game for the market is not so great a scourge as this; for this spirit searches out the game in every nook and cranny of the world, and spares not. In effect it says: ""If the law is defective, it is right for me to take every advantage of it! I do not need to have any conscience in the matter outside _the letter of the law_."" The extent to which this amazing spirit prevails is positively awful. You will find it among pseudo game-protectors to a paralyzing extent! It is the great gunner's paradox, and it pervades this country from corner to corner. No: there is no use in trying to ""educate"" the mass of the hunters of America out of it, as a means of saving the game; for positively it can not be done! Do not waste time in trying it. If you rely upon it, you will be doing a great wrong to wild life, and promoting extermination. The only remedy is _sweeping laws, for long close seasons, for a great many species_. Forget the paltry dollar-a-year license money. The license fees never represent more than a tenth part of the value of the game that is killed under licenses. The savage desire to kill ""all that the law allows"" often is manifested in men in whom we naturally expect to find a very different spirit. By way of illumination, I offer three cases out of the many that I could state. Case No. 1. _The Duck Breeder_.--A gentleman of my acquaintance has spent several years and much money in breeding wild ducks. From my relations with him, I had acquired the belief that he was a great lover of ducks, and at least wished all species well. One whizzing cold day in winter he called upon me, and stated that he had been duck-hunting; which surprised me. He added, ""I have just spent two days on Great South Bay, and I made a great killing. _In the two days I got ninety-four ducks!""_ I said, ""How _could_ you do it,--caring for wild ducks as you do?"" ""Well, I had hunted ducks twice before on Great South Bay and didn't have very good luck; but this time the cold weather drove the ducks in, and I got square with them!"" Case No. 2. _The Ornithologist_.--A short time ago the news was published in _Forest and Stream_, that a well-known ornithologist had distinguished himself in one of the mid-western states by the skill he had displayed in bagging thirty-four ducks in one day, greatly to the envy of the natives; and if this shoe fits any American naturalist, he is welcome to put it on and wear it. Case No. 3. _The Sportsman_.--A friend of mine in the South is the owner of a game preserve in which wild ducks are at times very numerous. Once upon a time he was visited by a northern sportsmen who takes a deep and abiding interest in the preservation of game. The sportsman was invited to go out duck-shooting; ducks being then in season there. He said: ""Yes, I will go; and I want you to put me in a place where I can kill a _hundred ducks in a day_! I never have done that yet, and I would like to do it, once!"" ""All right,"" said my friend, ""I can put you in such a place; and if you can shoot well enough, you can kill a hundred ducks in a day."" The effort was made in all earnestness. There was much shooting, but few were the ducks that fell before it. In concluding this story my friend remarked in a tone of disgust: ""All the game-preserving sportsmen that come to me are just like that! _They want to kill all they can kill_!"" There is a blood-test by which to separate the conscientious sportsmen from the mere gunners. Here it is: A _sportsman_ stops shooting when game becomes scarce; and he does not object to long-close-season laws; but A _gunner_ believes in killing ""all that the law allows;"" and _he objects to long close seasons_! I warrant that whenever and wherever this test is applied it will separate the sheep from the goats. It applies in all America, all Asia and Africa, and in Greenland, with equal force. [Illustration: G.O. SHIELDS A Notable Defender of Wild Life] THE GAME-HOG.--This term was coined by G.O. Shields, in 1897, when he was editor and owner of _Recreation Magazine_, and it has come into general use. It has been recognized by a judge on the bench as being an appropriate term to apply to all men who selfishly slaughter wild game beyond the limits of decency. Although it is a harsh term, and was mercilessly used by Mr. Shields in his fierce war on the men who slaughtered game for ""sport,"" it has jarred at least a hundred thousand men into their first realization of the fact that to-day there is a difference between decency and indecency in the pursuit of game. The use of the term has done _very great good_; but, strange to say, it has made for Mr. Shields a great many enemies _outside_ the ranks of the game-hogs themselves! From this one might fairly suppose that there is such a thing as a sympathetic game-hog! One thing at least is certain. During a period of about six years, while his war with the game-hogs was on, from Maine to California, Mr. Shields's name became a genuine terror to excessive killers of game; and it is reasonably certain that his war saved a great number of game birds from the slaughter that otherwise would have overtaken them! The number of armed men and boys who annually take the field in the United States in the pursuit of birds and quadrupeds, is enormous. People who do not shoot have no conception of it; and neither do they comprehend the mechanical perfection and fearful deadliness of the weapons used. This feature of the situation can hardly be realized until some aspect of it is actually seen. I have been at some pains to collect the latest figures showing the number of hunting licenses issued in 1911, but the total is incomplete. In some states the figures are not obtainable, and in some states there are no hunters' license laws. The figures of hunting licenses issued in 1911 that I have obtained from official sources are set forth below. THE UNITED STATES ARMY OF DESTRUCTION _Hunting Licenses issued in_ 1911 Alabama 5,090 Montana 59,291 California 138,689 Nebraska 39,402 Colorado 41,058 New Hampshire 33,542 Connecticut 19,635 New Jersey 61,920 Idaho 50,342 New Mexico 7,000 Illinois 192,244 New York 150,222 Indiana 54,813 Rhode Island 6,541 Iowa 91,000 South Dakota 31,054 Kansas 44,069 Utah 27,800 Louisiana 76,000 Vermont 31,762 Maine 2,552 Washington, about 40,000 Massachusetts 45,039 Wisconsin 138,457 Michigan 22,323 Wyoming 9,721 Missouri 66,662 --------- Total number of regularly licensed gunners 1,486,228 The average for the twenty-seven states that issued licenses as shown above is 55,046 for each state. Now, the twenty-one states issuing no licenses, or not reporting, produced in 1911 fully as many gunners per capita as did the other twenty-seven states. Computed fairly on existing averages they must have turned out a total of 1,155,966 gunners, making for all the United States =2,642,194= armed men and boys warring upon the remnant of game in 1911. We are not counting the large number of lawless hunters who never take out licenses. Now, is Mr. Beard's picture a truthful presentation, or not? _New York_ with only deer, ruffed grouse, shore-birds, ducks and a very few woodcock to shoot annually puts into the field 150,222 armed men. In 1909 they killed about _9,000 deer!_ _New Jersey_, spending $30,000 in 1912 in efforts to restock her covers with game, and with a population of 2,537,167, sent out in 1911 a total army of 61,920 well-armed gunners. How can any of her game survive? _New Hampshire_, with only 430,572 population, has 33,542 licensed hunters,--equal to _thirty-three regiments of full strength!_ _Vermont_, with 355,956 people, sends out annually an army of 31,762 men who hunt according to law; and in 1910 they killed 3,649 deer. _Utah_, with only 373,351 population, had 27,800 men in the field after her very small remnant of game! How can any wild thing of Utah escape? _Montana_, population 376,053, had in 1911 an army of 59,291 well-armed men, warring chiefly upon the big game, and swiftly exterminating it. How long can any of the big game stand before the army of _two and one-half million well-armed men_, eager and keen to kill, and out to get an equivalent for their annual expenditure in guns, ammunition and other expenses? In addition to the hunters themselves, they are assisted by thousands of expert guides, thousands of horses, thousands of dogs, hundreds of automobiles and hundreds of thousands of tents. Each big-game hunter has an experienced guide who knows the haunts and habits of the game, the best feeding grounds, the best trails, and everything else that will aid the hunter in taking the game at a disadvantage and destroying it. The big-game rifles are of the highest power, the longest range, the greatest accuracy and the best repeating mechanism that modern inventive genius can produce. It is said that in Wyoming the Maxim silencer is now being used. England has produced a weapon of a new type, called ""the scatter rifle,"" which is intended for use on ducks. The best binoculars are used in searching out the game, and horses carry the hunters and guides as near as possible to the game. For bears, baits are freely used, and in the pursuit of pumas, dogs are employed to the limit of the available supply. The deadliness of the automobile in hunting already is so apparent that North Dakota has wisely and justly forbidden their use by law, (1911). The swift machine enables city gunmen to penetrate game regions they could not reach with horses, and hunt through from four to six localities per day, instead of one only, as formerly. The use of automobiles in hunting should be everywhere prohibited. Every appliance and assistance that money can buy, the modern sportsman secures to help him against the game. The game is beset during its breeding season by various wild enemies,--foxes, cats, wolves, pumas, lynxes, eagles, and many other predatory species. The only help that it receives is in the form of an annual close season--_which thus far has saved in America only a few local moose, white-tailed deer and a few game birds, from steady and sure extermination_. _The bag limits on which vast reliance is placed to preserve the wild game, are a fraud, a delusion and a snare_! The few local exceptions only prove the generality of the rule. In every state, without one single exception, the bag limits are far too high, and the laws are of deadly liberality. In many states, the bag limit laws on birds are an absolute dead letter. Fancy the 125 wardens of New York enforcing the bag-limit laws on 150,000 gunners! It is this horrible condition that is enabling the licensed army of destruction to get in its deadly work on the game, all over the world. In America, the over-liberality of the laws are to blame for two-thirds of the carnival of slaughter, and the successful evasions of the law are responsible for the other third. [Illustration: TWO GUNNERS OF KANSAS CITY Who Believe in Killing all That the Law Allows. They are not so Much to Blame as the System That Permits Such Slaughter. (Note the Pump Guns)] [Illustration: WHY THE SANDHILL CRANE IS BECOMING EXTINCT Nineteen of Them Killed as ""Game"" by Three Gunners. Note the Machine Gun.] The only remedy for the present extermination of game according to law that so rapidly and so furiously is proceeding all over the United States, Canada, Alaska, and Africa, is ten-year close seasons on all the species threatened with extinction, and immensely reduced open seasons and bag limits on all the others. Will the people who still have wild game take heed now, and clamp down the brakes, hard and fast before it is too late, or will they have their game exterminated? Shall we have five-year close seasons, or close seasons of 500 years? We must take our choice. Shall we hand down to our children a gameless continent, with all the shame that such a calamity will entail? We have _got_ to answer these questions like men, or they will soon be answered for us by the extermination of the wild life. For twenty-five years we have been smarting under the disgrace of the extermination of our bison millions. Let us not repeat the dose through the destruction of other species. * * * * * CHAPTER VII THE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION We have now to deal with THE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION. In warfare, a _guerrilla, or bushwhacker_, is an armed man who recognizes none of the rules of civilized warfare, and very often has no commander. In France he is called a ""franc-tireur,"" or free-shooter. The guerrilla goes out to live on the country, to skulk, to war on the weak, and never attack save from ambush, or when the odds clearly are on his side. His military status is barely one remove from that of the spy. The meat-shooters who harry the game and other wild life in order to use it as a staple food supply; the Italians, negroes and others who shoot song-birds as food; the plume-hunters and the hide-and-tusk hunters all over the world are the guerrillas of the Army of Destruction. Let us consider some of these grand divisions in detail. Here is an inexorable law of Nature, to which there are no exceptions: _No wild species of bird, mammal, reptile or fish can withstand exploitation for commercial purposes_. The men who pursue wild creatures for the money or other value there is in them, never give up. They work at slaughter when other men are enjoying life, or are asleep. If they are persistent, no species on which they fix the Evil Eye escapes extermination at their hands. Does anyone question this statement? If so let him turn backward and look at the lists of dead and dying species. THE DIVISION OF MEAT-SHOOTERS contains all men who sordidly shoot for the frying-pan,--to save bacon and beef at the expense of the public, or for the markets. There are a few wilderness regions so remote and so difficult of access that the transportation of meat into them is a matter of much difficulty and expense. There are a very few men in North America who are justified in ""living off the country,"" _for short periods_. The genuine prospectors always have been counted in this class; but all miners who are fully located, all lumbermen and railway-builders certainly are not in the prospector's class. They are abundantly able to maintain continuous lines of communication for the transit of beef and mutton. Of all the meat-shooters, the market-gunners who prey on wild fowl and ground game birds for the big-city markets are the most deadly to wild life. Enough geese, ducks, brant, quail, ruffed grouse, prairie chickens, heath hens and wild pigeons have been butchered by gunners and netters for ""the market"" to have stocked the whole world. No section containing a good supply of game has escaped. In the United States the great slaughtering-grounds have been Cape Cod; Great South Bay, New York; Currituck Sound, North Carolina; Marsh Island, Louisiana; the southwest corner of Louisiana; the Sunk Lands of Arkansas; the lake regions of Minnesota; the prairies of the whole middle West; Great Salt Lake; the Klamath Lake region (Oregon) and southern California. [Illustration: A MARKET GUNNER AT WORK ON MARSH ISLAND Killing Mallards for the New Orleans Market. The Purchase of This Island by Mrs. Russell Sage has now Converted it Into a Bird Sanctuary] The output of this systematic bird slaughter has supplied the greedy game markets of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. The history of this industry, its methods, its carnage, its profits and its losses would make a volume, but we can not enter upon it here. Beyond reasonable doubt, this awful traffic in dead game is responsible for at least three-fourths of the slaughter that has reduced our game birds to a mere remnant of their former abundance. There is no influence so deadly to wild life as that of the market gunner who works six days a week, from sunrise until sunset, hunting down and killing every game bird that he can reach with a choke-bore gun. During the past five years, several of the once-great killing grounds have been so thoroughly ""shot out"" that they have ceased to hold their former rank. This is the case with the Minnesota Lakes, the Sunk Lands of Arkansas, the Klamath Lakes of Oregon, and I think it is also true of southern California. The Klamath Lakes have been taken over by the Government as a bird refuge. Currituck Sound, at the northeastern corner of North Carolina, has been so bottled up by the Bayne law of New York State that Currituck's greatest market has been cut off. Last year only one-half the usual number of ducks and geese were killed; and already many ""professional"" duck and brant shooters have abandoned the business because the commission merchants no longer will buy dead birds. [Illustration: RUFFED GROUSE A Common Victim of Illegal Slaughter] Very many enormous bags of game have been made in a day by market gunners: but rarely have they published any of their records. The greatest kill of which I ever have heard occurred under the auspices of the Glenn County Club, in southern California, on February 5, 1906. Two men, armed with automatic shot-guns, fired five shots apiece, and got ten geese out of one flock. In one hour they killed _two hundred and eighteen geese_, and their bag for the day was _four hundred and fifty geese!_ The shooter who wrote the story for publication (on February 12, at Willows, Glenn County, California) said: ""It being warm weather, the birds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling."" A photograph was made of the ""one hour's slaughter"" of two hundred and eighteen geese, and it was published in a western magazine with ""C.H.B.'s"" story, nearly all of which will be found in Chapter XV. The reasons why market shooting is so deadly destructive to wild life are not obscure. The true sportsman hunts during a very few days only each year. The market gunners shoot early and late, six days a week, month after month. When game is abundant, the price is low, and a great quantity must be killed in order to make it pay well. When game is scarce, the market prices are high, and the shooter makes the utmost exertions to find the last of the game in order to secure the ""big money."" When game is protected by law, thousands of people with money desire it for their tables, just the same, and are willing to pay fabulous prices for what they want, when they want it. Many a dealer is quite willing to run the risk of fines, because fines don't really hurt; they are only annoying. The dealer wishes to make the big profit, and _retain his customers_; ""and besides,"" he reasons, ""if I don't supply him some one else will; so what is the difference?"" When game is scarce, prices high and the consumer's money ready, there are a hundred tricks to which shooters and dealers willingly resort to ship and receive unlawful game without detection. It takes the very best kind of game wardens,--genuine detectives, in fact,--to ferret out these cunning illegal practices, and catch lawbreakers ""with the goods on them,"" so that they can be punished. Mind you, convictions can not be secured at _both_ ends of the line save by the most extraordinary good fortune, and usually the shooter and shipper escape, even when the dealer is apprehended and fined. [Illustration: A PERFECTLY LAWFUL BAG OF 58 RUFFED GROUSE FOR TWO MEN From ""Rod and Gun in Canada""] Here are some of the methods that have been practiced in the past in getting illegal game into the New York market: Ruffed grouse and quail have both been shipped in butter firkins, marked ""butter""; and latterly, butter has actually been packed solidly on top of the birds. Ruffed grouse and quail very often have been shipped in egg crates, marked ""eggs."" They have been shipped in trunks and suit cases,--a very common method for illegal game birds, all over the United States. In Oklahoma when a man refuses to open his trunk for a game warden, the warden joyously gets out his brace and bitt, and bores an inch hole into the lower story of the trunk. If dead birds are there, the tell-tale auger quickly reveals them. Three years ago, I was told that certain milk-wagons on Long Island made daily collections of dead ducks intended for the New York market, and the drivers kindly shipped them by express from the end of the route. Once upon a time, a New York man gave notice that on a certain date he would be in a certain town in St. Lawrence County, New York, with a palace horse-car, ""to buy horses."" Car and man appeared there as advertised. Very ostentatiously, he bought one horse, and had it taken aboard the car before the gaze of the admiring populace. At night, when the A.P. had gone to bed, many men appeared, and into the horseless end of that car, they loaded thousands of ruffed grouse. The game warden who described the incident to me said: ""That man pulled out for New York with one horse and _half a car load of ruffed grouse_!"" Whenever a good market exists for the sale of game, as sure as the world that market will be supplied. Twenty-six states forbid by law the sale of _their own_ ""protected"" game, but twenty of them do _not_ expressly prohibit the sale of game stolen from neighboring states! That is _a very, very weak point in the laws of all those states_. A child can see how it works. Take Pittsburgh as a case in point. In the winter and spring of 1912 the State Game Commission of Pennsylvania found that quail and ruffed grouse were being sold in Pittsburgh, in large quantities. The state laws were well enforced, and it was believed that the birds were not being killed in Pennsylvania. Some other state was being _robbed_! The Game Commission went to work, and in a very short time certain game-dealers of Pittsburgh were arrested. At first they tried to bluff their way out of their difficulty, and even went as far as to bring charges against the game-warden whom the Commission had instructed to buy some of their illegal game, and pay for it. But the net of the law tightened upon them so quickly and so tightly that they threw up their hands and begged for mercy. It was found that those Pittsburgh game-dealers were selling quail and grouse that had been stolen in thousands, from the state of Kentucky! Between the state game laws, working in lovely harmony with the Lacey federal law that prohibits the shipment of game illegally killed or sold, the whole bad business was laid bare, and signed confessions were promptly obtained from the shippers in Kentucky. At that very time, a good bill for the better protection of her game was before the Kentucky legislature; and a certain member was vigorously opposing it, as he had successfully done in previous years. He was told that the state was being robbed, but refused to believe it. Then a signed confession was laid before him, bearing the name of the man who was instigating his opposition,--his friend,--who confessed that he had illegally bought and shipped to Pittsburgh over 5,000 birds. The objector literally threw up his hands, and said, ""I have been _wrong!_ Let the bill go through!"" And it went. [Illustration: SNOW BUNTING A Great ""Game Bird""! Of These, 8,058 Were Found in 1902 in one New York Cold-Storage Warehouse] Before the passage of the Bayne law, New York City was a ""fence"" for the sale of grouse illegally killed in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and I know not how many other states. The Bayne law stopped all that business, abruptly and forever; and if the ruffed grouse, quail and ducks of the Eastern States are offered for sale in Chicago, Cincinnati, Baltimore and Washington, the people of New York and Massachusetts can at least be assured that they are not to blame. Those two states now maintain no ""fences"" for the sale of game that has been stolen from other states. They have both set their houses in order, and set two examples for forty other states to follow. The remedy for all this miserable game-stealing, law-breaking business is simple and easily obtained. Let each state of the United States and each province and Canada _enact a Bayne law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of all wild native game_, and the thing is done! But nothing short of that will be really effective. It will not do at all to let state laws rest with merely forbidding the sale of game ""protected by the State;"" for that law is full of loop-holes. It does much good service, yes; but what earthly _objection_ can there be in any state to the enactment of a law that is sweepingly effective, and which can not be evaded, save through the criminal connivance of officers of the law? By way of illustration, to show what the sale of wild game means to the remnant of our game, and the wicked slaughter of non-game birds to which it leads, consider these figures: DEAD BIRDS FOUND IN ONE COLD STORAGE HOUSE IN NEW YORK IN 1902. Snow Buntings 8,058 Grouse 7,560 Sandpipers 7,607 Quail 4,385 Plover 5,218 Ducks 1,756 Snipe 7,003 Bobolinks 288 Yellow-legs 788 Woodcock 96 The fines for this lot, if imposed, would have amounted to $1,168,315. Shortly after that seizure American quail became so scarce that in effect they totally disappeared from the banquet tables of New York. I can not recall having been served with one since 1903, but the little Egyptian quail can be legally imported and sold when officially tagged. Few persons away from the firing line realize the far-reaching effects of the sale of wild game. Here are a few flashes from the searchlight: At Hangkow, China, Mr. C. William Beebe found that during his visit in =1911=, over =46,000= pheasants of various species were shipped from that port on one cold-storage steamer to the London market. And this when English pheasants were selling in the Covent Garden market at from two to three shillings each, for _fresh_ birds! In =1910=, =1,200= ptarmigan from Norway, bound for the Chicago market, passed through the port of New York,--not by any means the first or the last shipment of the kind. The epicures of Chicago are being permitted to comb the game out of Norway. In =1910=, =70,000= _dozen_ Egyptian quail were shipped to Europe from Alexandria, Egypt. Just why that species has not already been exterminated, is a zoological mystery; but extermination surely will come some day, and I think it will be in the near future. The coast of China has been raked and scraped for wild ducks to ship to New York,--prior to the passage of the Bayne law! I have forgotten the figures that once were given me, but they were an astonishing number of thousands for the year. The Division of Negroes and Poor Whites who kill song and other birds indiscriminately will be found in a separate chapter. THE DIVISION OF ""RESIDENT"" GAME-BUTCHERS.--This refers to the men who live in the haunts of big game, where wardens are the most of the time totally absent, and where bucks, does and fawns of hoofed big game may be killed in season and out of season, with impunity. It includes guides, ranchmen, sheep-herders, cowboys, miners, lumbermen and floaters generally. In times past, certain taxidermists of Montana promoted the slaughter of wild bison in the Yellowstone Park, and it was a pair of rascally taxidermists who killed, or caused to be killed in Lost Park, in 1897, the very last bison of Colorado. It seems to be natural for the minds of men who live in America in the haunts of big game to drift into the idea that the wild game around them is all theirs. Very few of them recognize the fact that every other man, woman and child in a given state or province has vested rights in its wild game. It is natural for a frontiersman to feel that because he is in the wilds he has a God-given right to live off the country; but to-day _that idea is totally wrong_! If some way can not be found to curb that all-pervading propensity among our frontiersmen, then we may as well bid all our open-field big game a long farewell; for the deadly ""residents"" surely will exterminate it, outside the game preserves. The ""residents"" are, in my opinion, about ten times more destructive than the sportsmen. A sportsman in quest of large game is in the field only from ten to thirty days; all his movements are known, and all his trophies are seen and counted. His killing is limited by law, and upon him the law is actually enforced. Often a resident hunts the whole twelve months of the year,--for food, for amusement, and for trophies to sell. Rarely does a game warden reach his cabin; because the wardens are few, the distances great and the frontier cabins are widely scattered. Mr. Carl Pickhardt told me of a guide in Newfoundland who had a shed in the woods hanging full of bodies of caribou, and who admitted to him that while the law allowed him five caribou each year, he killed each year about twenty-five. Mr. J.M. Phillips knows of a mountain in British Columbia, once well stocked with goats, on which the goats have been completely exterminated by one man who lives within easy striking distance of them, and who finds goat meat to his liking. I have been reliably informed that in 1911, at Haha Lake, near Grande Bay, Saguenay District, P.Q., one family of six persons killed thirty-four woodland caribou and six moose. This meant the waste of about 14,000 pounds of good meat, and the death of several female animals. In 1886 I knew a man named Owens who lived on the head of Sunday Creek, Montana, who told me that in 1884-5 he killed thirty-five mule deer for himself and family. The family ate as much as possible, the dogs ate all they could, and in the spring the remainder spoiled. Now there is not a deer, an antelope, or a sage grouse within fifty miles of that lifeless waste. Here is a Montana object lesson on the frame of mind of the ""resident"" hunter, copied from _Outdoor Life_ Magazine (Denver) for February, 1912. It is from a letter to the Editor, written by C.B. Davis. November 27, 28, 29, and 30, 1911, will remain a red letter day with a half thousand men for years to come. These half thousand men gathered along the border of the Yellowstone National Park, near Gardiner, Montana, at a point known as Buffalo Flats, to exterminate elk. The snow had driven the elk down to the foothills, and Buffalo Flats is on the border of the park and outside the park. The elk entered this little valley for food. Like hungry wolves, shooters, not hunters, gathered along the border waiting to catch an elk off the ""reservation"" and kill it. On November 27th about 1500 elk crossed the line, and the slaughter began. I have not the data of the number killed this day, but it was hundreds. On the 28th, twenty-two stepped over and were promptly executed. Like Custer's band, not one escaped. On the evening of the 28th, 600 were sighted just over the line, and the army of 125 brave men entrenched themselves for the battle which was expected to open next morning. Before daylight of the 29th the battle began. The elk were over the line, feeding on Buffalo Flats. One hundred and twenty-five men poured bullets into this band of 600 elk till the ground was red with blood and strewn with carcasses, and in their madness they shot each other. One man was shot through the ear,--a close call; another received a bullet through his coat sleeve, and another was shot through the bowels and can't live. My informer told me he participated in the slaughter, and while he would not take fifty dollars for what he saw, and the experience he went through, yet he would not go through it again for $1,000. When my informer got back to Gardiner that day there were four sleigh loads of elk, each load containing from twenty to thirty-five elk, besides thirty-two mules and horses carrying one to two each. This was only a part of the slaughter. Hundreds more were carried to other points; and this was only one day's work. Hundreds of wounded elk wandered back into the park to die, and others died outside the park. The station at Livingston, Montana, for a week looked like a packing house. Carcasses were piled up on the trucks and depot platform. The baggage cars were loaded with elk going to points east and west of Livingston. Maybe this is all right. Maybe the government can't stop the elk from crossing the line. Maybe the elk were helped over; but it strikes me there is something wrong somewhere. THE DIVISION OF HIRED LABORERS.--The scourge of lumber-camps in big-game territory, the mining camps and the railroad-builders is a long story, and if told in detail it would make several chapters. Their awful destructiveness is well known. It is a common thing for ""the boss"" to hire a hunter to kill big game to supply the hungry outfit, and save beef and pork. The abuses arising from this source easily could be checked, and finally suppressed. A ten-line law would do the business,--forbidding any person employed in any camp of sheep men, cattle men, lumbermen, miners, railway laborers or excavators to own or use a rifle in hunting wild game; and forbidding any employer of labor to feed those laborers, or permit them to be fed, on the flesh of wild game mammals or birds. ""Camp"" laborers are not ""pioneers;"" not by a long shot! They are soldiers of Commerce, and makers of money. A MOUNTAIN SHEEP CASE IN COLORADO.--The state of Colorado sincerely desires to protect and perpetuate its slender remnant of mountain sheep, but as usual the Lawless Miscreant is abroad to thwart the efforts of the guardians of the game. Every state that strives to protect its big game has such doings as this to contend with: In the winter of 1911-12, a resident poacher brought into Grant, Colorado, a lot of mountain sheep meat _for sale_; and he actually sold it to residents of that town! The price was _six cents per pound_. A lot of it was purchased by the railway station-agent. I have no doubt that the same man who did that job, which was made possible only by the co-operation of the citizens of Grant, will try the same poaching-and-selling game next winter, unless the State Game Commissioner is able to bring him to book. A WYOMING CASE IN POINT.--As a fair sample of what game wardens, and the general public, are sometimes compelled to endure through the improper decisions of judges, I will cite this case: In the Shoshone Mountains of northern Wyoming, about fifty miles or so from the town of Cody, in the winter of 1911-12 a man was engaged in trapping coyotes. It was currently reported that he had been ""driven out of Montana and Idaho."" He had scores of traps. He baited his traps with the flesh of deer, elk calves and grouse, all illegally killed and illegally used for that purpose. A man of my acquaintance saw some of this game meat actually used as described. The man was a notorious character, and cruel in the extreme. Finally a game warden caught him red-handed, arrested him, and took him to Cody for trial. It happened that the judge on the bench had once trapped with him, and therefore ""he set the game-killer free, while the game-warden was roasted."" That wolf-trapper once took into the mountains a horse, to kill and use as bear-bait. The animal was blind in one eye, and because it would not graze precisely where the wolfer desired it to remain, he deliberately destroyed the sight of its good eye, and left it for days, without the ability to find water. Think of the fate of any wild animal that unkind Fate places at the mercy of such a man! * * * * * CHAPTER VIII UNSEEN FOES OF WILD LIFE Quite unintentionally on his part, Man, the arch destroyer and the most predatory and merciless of all animal species except the wolves, has rendered a great service to all the birds that live or nest upon the ground. His relentless pursuit and destruction of the savage-tempered, strong-jawed fur-bearing animals is in part the salvation of the ground birds of to-day and yesterday. If the teeth and claws had been permitted to multiply unchecked down to the present time, with man's warfare on the upland game proceeding as it has done, scores upon scores of species long ere this would have been exterminated. But the slaughter of the millions of North American foxes, wolves, weasels, skunks, and mink has so overwhelmingly reduced the four-footed enemies of the birds that the balance of wild Nature has been preserved. As a rule, the few predatory wild animals that remain are not slaughtering the birds to a serious extent; and for this we may well be thankful. THE DOMESTIC CAT.--In such thickly settled communities as our northern states, from the Atlantic coast to the sandhills of Kansas and Nebraska, the domestic cat is probably the greatest four-footed scourge of bird life. Thousands of persons who never have seen a hunting cat in action will doubt this statement, but the proof of its truthfulness is only too painfully abundant. Unhappily it is the way of the hunting cat to stalk unseen, and to kill the very birds that are most friendly with man, and most helpful to him in his farming and fruit-growing business. The quail is about the only game bird that the cat affects seriously, and to it the cat is very destructive. It is the robin, catbird, thrush, bluebird, dove, woodpecker, chickadee, phoebe, tanager and other birds of the lawn, the garden and orchard that afford good hunting for sly and savage old Thomas. When I was a boy in my 'teens, I had a lasting series of object lessons on the cat as a predatory animal. Our ""Betty"" was the most ambitious and successful domestic-cat hunter of wild mammals of which I ever have heard. To her, rats and mice were mere child's-play, and after a time their pursuit offered such tame sport that she sought fresh fields for her prowess. Then she brought in young rabbits, chipmunks and thirteen-lined spermophiles, and once she came in, quite exhausted, half dragging and half carrying a big, fat pocket gopher. With her it seemed to be a point of honor that she should bring in her game and display it. Little did we realize then that in course of time the wild birds would become so scarce that their slaughter by house cats would demand legislative action in the states. In considering the hunting cat, let us call in a credible witness of the effects of domestic cats on the bob white. The following is an eye-witness report, by Ernest B. Beardsley, in _Outdoor Life_ for April, 1912. The locality was Wellington, Sumner County, Kansas. In the meantime, old Queen was having a high old time up ahead, some hundred feet by then, running up the bank and back down in the draw. We had hardly caught up when up goes Mr. Savage's gun and he gives both barrels. I had seen nothing up to date, but I didn't have long to wait, for by the time I got up to him and the dog, they were both in the high grass and had a great, big, common gray maltese house-cat; and Queen had a half-eaten quail that Mr. Cat was busy with when disturbed. Well, we followed the draw across the field and got nine of a covey of sixteen that had been ahead of Mr. Cat; and about four o'clock that evening we killed another white-and-gray cat. While driving home that night, Mr. Savage told me that he had killed fifty or more in three or four years. They will get in a draw full of tumble-grass, on a cold day when quail don't like to fly, and stay right with them; and even after feeding on two or three, they will lie and watch, and when the covey moves, they move. When eating time comes around they are at it again, and to a covey of young birds they are sure death to the whole covey. Well, Will told me never to overlook a house-cat that I found as far as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch, for if they have not already turned wild, they are learning how easy it is to hunt and live on game, and are almost as bad. We found Mr. Black-and-White Hunter had eaten two quail just before we killed him that evening. I would rather not write what Mr. Savage said when we found the remains of a partly-eaten bird. My advice is, don't let tame cats get away when found out hunting; for the chances are they have not seen a home in months, and maybe years,--and say! but they do get big and bad. When you meet one, give it to him good, and don't let your dog run up to him until he is out for keeps. I learned afterwards that was how Will knew it was a cat. Queen had learned to back off and call for help on cats some years before. In the New York Zoological Park, we have had troubles of our own with marauding cats. They establish themselves in a day, and quickly learn where to seek easy game and good cover. In the daytime they lie close in the thick brush, exactly as tigers do in India, but if not molested for a period of days, they become bold and attack game in open view. One bird-killing cat was so shy of man that it was only after two weeks of hard hunting (mornings and evenings) that it was killed. We have seen cats catch and kill gray squirrels, chipmunks, robins and thrushes, and have found the feathers of slaughtered quail. Once we had gray rabbits breeding in the park, and their number reached between eighty and ninety. For a time they fearlessly hopped about in sight from our windows, and they were of great interest to visitors and to all of us. Then the cats began upon them; and in one year there was not a rabbit to be seen, save at rare intervals. At the same time the chipmunks of the park were almost exterminated. That was the last straw, and we began a vigorous war upon those wild and predatory cats. The cats came off second best. We killed every cat that was found hunting in the park, and we certainly got some that were big and bad. We eliminated that pest, and we are keeping it eliminated. And with what result? In 1911 a covey of eleven quail came and settled in our grounds, and have remained there. Twenty times at least during the past eight months (winter and spring) I have seen the flock on the granite ledge not more than forty feet from the rear window of my office. Last spring when I left the Administration Building at six o'clock, after the visitors had gone, I found two half-grown rabbits calmly roosting on the door-mat. The rabbits are slowly coming back, and the chipmunks are visibly increasing in number. The gray squirrels now chase over the walks without fear of any living thing, and our ducklings and young guineas and peacocks are safe once more. That cats destroy annually in the United States several _millions_ of very valuable birds, seems fairly beyond question. I believe that in settled regions they are worse than weasels, foxes, skunks and mink _combined_; because there are about one hundred times as many of them, and those that hunt are not afraid to hunt in the daytime. Of course I am not saying that _all_ cats hunt wild game; but in the country I believe that fully one-half of them do. I am personally acquainted with a cat in Indiana, on the farm of relatives, which is notorious for its hunting propensities, and its remarkable ability in capturing game. Even the lady who is joint owner of the cat feels very badly about its destructiveness, and has said, over and over again, that it ought to be killed; but the cat is such a family pet that no one in the family has the heart to destroy it, and as yet no stranger has come forward to play the part of executioner. The lady in question assured me that to her certain knowledge that particular cat would watch a nestful of young robins week after week until they had grown up to such a size that they were almost ready to fly; then he would kill them and devour them. Old ""Tommy"" was too wise to kill the robins when they were unduly small. In a great book entitled _Useful Birds and Their Protection_, by E.H. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, and published by the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture in 1905, there appears, on page 362, many interesting facts on this subject. For example: Mr. William Brewster tells of an acquaintance in Maine, who said that his cat killed about fifty birds a year. Mr. A.C. Dike wrote [to Mr. Forbush] of a cat owned by a family, and well cared for. They watched it through one season, and found that it killed fifty-eight birds, including the young in five nests. Nearly a hundred correspondents, scattered through all the counties of the state, report the cat as one of the greatest enemies of birds. The reports that have come in of the torturing and killing of birds by cats are absolutely sickening. The number of birds killed by them in this state is appalling. Some cat lovers believe that each cat kills on the average not more than ten birds a year; but I have learned of two instances where more than that number were killed in a single day, and another where seven were killed. If we assume, however, that the average cat on the farm kills but ten birds per year, and that there is one cat to each farm in Massachusetts, we have, in round numbers, seventy thousand cats, killing seven hundred thousand birds annually. [Illustration: A HUNTING CAT AND ITS VICTIM This Cat had fed so bountifully on the Rabbits and Squirrels of the Zoological Park, that it ate only the Brain of this Gray Rabbit] In Mr. Forbush's book there is an illustration of the cat which killed fifty-eight birds in one year, and the animal was photographed with a dead robin in its mouth. The portrait is reproduced in this chapter. Last year, a strong effort was made in Massachusetts to enact a law requiring cats to be licensed. On account of the amount of work necessary in passing the no-sale-of-game bill, that measure was not pressed, and so it did not become a law; but another year it will undoubtedly be passed, for it is a good bill, and extremely necessary at this time. _Such a law is needed in every state_! There is a mark by which you may instantly and infallibly know the worst of the wild cats--by their presence _away from home, hunting in the open_. Kill all such, wherever found. The harmless cats are domestic in their tastes, and stay close to the family fireside and the kitchen. Being properly fed, they have no temptation to become hunters. There are cats and cats, just as there are men and men: some tolerable, many utterly intolerable. No sweeping sentiment for _all_ cats should be allowed to stand in the way of the abatement of the hunting-cat nuisances. _Of all men, the farmer cannot afford the luxury of their existence_! It is too expensive. With him it is a matter of dollars, and cash out of pocket for every hunting cat that he tolerates in his neighborhood. There are two places in which to strike the hunting cats: in the open, and in the state legislature. While this chapter was in the hands of the compositors, the hunting cat and gray rabbit shown in the accompanying illustration were brought in by a keeper. DOGS AS DESTROYERS OF BIRDS.--I have received many letters from protectors of wild life informing me that the destruction of ground-nesting birds, and especially of upland game birds, by roaming dogs, has in some localities become a great curse to bird life. Complaints of this kind have come from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Usually the culprits are _hunting dogs_--setters, pointers and hounds. Now, surely it is not necessary to set forth here any argument on this subject. It is not open to argument, or academic treatment of any kind. The cold fact is: In the breeding season of birds, and while the young birds are incapable of quick and strong flight, all dogs, of every description, should be restrained from free hunting; and all dogs found hunting in the woods during the season referred to should be arrested, and their owners should be fined twenty dollars for each offense. Incidentally, one-half the fine should go to the citizen who arrests the dog. The method of restraining hunting dogs should devolve upon dog owners; and the law need only prohibit or punish the act. Beyond a doubt, in states that still possess quail and ruffed grouse, free hunting by hunting dogs leads to great destruction of nests and broods during the breeding season. TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WIRES.--Mr. Daniel C. Beard has strongly called my attention to the slaughter of birds by telegraph wires that has come under his personal observation. His country home, at Redding, Connecticut, is near the main line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway, along which a line of very large poles carries a great number of wires. The wires are so numerous that they form a barrier through which it is difficult for any bird to fly and come out alive and unhurt. Mr. Beard says that among the birds killed or crippled by flying against those wires near Redding he has seen the following species: olive-backed thrush, white-throated sparrow and other sparrows, oriole, blue jay, rail, ruffed grouse, and woodcock. It is a common practice for employees of the railway, and others living along the line, to follow the line and pick up on one excursion enough birds for a pot-pie. Beyond question, the telegraph and telephone wires of the United States annually exact a heavy toll in bird life, and claim countless thousands of victims. They may well be set down as one of the unseen forces destructive to birds. Naturally, we ask, what can be done about it? I am told that in Scotland such slaughter is prevented by the attachment of small tags or discs to the telephone wires, at intervals of a few rods, sufficiently near that they attract the attention of flying birds, and reveal the line of an obstruction. This system should be adopted in all regions where the conditions are such that birds kill themselves against telegraph wires, and an excellent place to begin would be along the line of the N.Y., N.H. & H. Railway. WILD ANIMALS.--Beyond question, it is both desirable and necessary that any excess of wild animals that prey upon our grouse, quail, pheasants, woodcock, snipe, mallard duck, shore birds and other species that nest on the ground, should be killed. Since we must choose between the two, the birds have it! Weasels and foxes and skunks are interesting, and they do much to promote the hilarity of life in rural districts, but they do not destroy insects, and are of comparatively little value as destroyers of the noxious rodents that prey upon farm crops. While a few persons may dispute the second half of this proposition, the burden of proof that my view is wrong will rest upon them; and having spent eighteen years ""on the farm,"" I think I am right. If there is any positive evidence tending to prove that the small carnivores that we class as ""vermin"" are industrious and persistent destroyers of noxious rodents--pocket gophers, moles, field-mice and rats--or that they do not kill wild birds numerously, now is the time to produce it, because the tide of public sentiment is strongly setting against the weasels, mink, foxes and skunks. (Once upon a time, a shrewd young man in the Zoological Park discovered a weasel hiding behind a stone while devouring a sparrow that it had just caught and killed. He stalked it successfully, seized it in his bare hand, and, even though bitten, made good the capture.) The State of Pennsylvania is extensively wooded, with forests and with brush which affords excellent home quarters and breeding grounds for mammalian ""vermin."" The small predatory mammals are so seriously destructive to ruffed grouse and other ground birds that the State Game Commission is greatly concerned. When the hunter's license law is enacted, as it very surely will be at the next session of the legislature (1913), a portion of the $70,000 that it will produce each year will be used by the commission in paying bounties on the destruction of the surplus of vermin. Through the pursuit of vermin, any farmer can easily win enough bounties to more than pay the cost of his annual hunting license (one dollar), and the farmers' boys will find a new interest in life. In some portions of the Rocky Mountain region, the assaults of the large predatory mammals and birds on the young of the big-game species occasionally demand special treatment. In the Yellowstone Park the pumas multiplied to such an extent and killed so many young elk that their number had to be systematically reduced. To that end ""Buffalo"" Jones was sent out by the Government to find and destroy the intolerable surplus of pumas. In the course of his campaign he killed about forty, much to the benefit of the elk herds. Around the entrance to the den of a big old male puma, Mr. Jones found the skulls and other remains of nine elk calves that ""the old Tom"" had killed and carried there. Pumas and lynxes attack and kill mountain sheep; and the golden eagle is very partial to mountain sheep lambs and mountain goat kids. It will not answer to permit birds of that bold and predatory species to become too numerous in mountains inhabited by goats and sheep; and the fewer the mountain lions the better, for they, like the lynx and eagle, have nothing to live upon save the game. The wolves and coyotes have learned to seek the ranges of cattle, horses and sheep, where they still do immense damage, chiefly in killing young stock. In spite of the great sums that have been paid out by western states in bounties for the destruction of wolves, in many, many places the gray wolf still persists, and can not be exterminated. To the stockmen of the west the wolf question is a serious matter. The stockmen of Montana say that a government expert once told them how to get rid of the gray wolves. His instructions were: ""Locate the dens, and kill the young in the dens, soon after they are born!"" ""All very easy to _say_, but a trifle difficult to _do_!"" said my informant; and the ranchman seem to think they are yet a long way from a solution of the wolf question. During the past year the destruction of noxious predatory animals in the national forest reserves has seriously occupied the attention of the United States Bureau of Forestry. By the foresters of that bureau the following animals were destroyed in fifteen western states: 6,487 Coyotes 870 Wild-Cats 72 Lynxes 213 Bears 88 Mountain Lions 172 Gray Wolves 69 Wolf Pups ----- 7,971 In 1910 the total was 9,103. [Illustration: THE EASTERN RED SQUIRREL A Great Destroyer of Birds] THE RED SQUIRREL.--Once in a great while, conditions change in subtle ways, wild creatures unexpectedly increase in number, and a community awakens to the fact that some wild species has become a public nuisance. In a small city park, even gray squirrels may breed and become so fearfully numerous that, in their restless quest for food, they may ravage the nests of the wild birds, kill and devour the young, and become a pest. In the Zoological Park, in 1903, we found that the red squirrels had increased to such a horde that they were driving out all our nesting wild birds, driving out the gray squirrels, and making themselves intolerably obnoxious. We shot sixty of them, and brought the total down to a reasonable number. Wherever he is or whatever his numerical strength, the red squirrel is a bad citizen, and, while we do not by any means favor his extermination, he should resolutely be kept within bounds by the rifle. When a crow nested in our woods, near the Beaver Pond, we were greatly pleased; but with the feeding of the first brood, the crows began to carry off ducklings from the wild-fowl pond. After one crow had been seen to seize and carry away _five_ young ducks in one forenoon, we decided that the constitutional limit had been reached, for we did not propose that all our young mallards should be swept into the awful vortex of that crow nest. We took those young crows and reared them by hand; but the old one had acquired a bad habit, and she persisted in carrying off young ducks until we had to end her existence with a gun. It was a painful operation, but there was no other way. [Illustration: COOPER'S HAWK A Species to be Destroyed] BIRD-DESTROYING BIRDS.--There are several species of birds that may at once be put under sentence of death for their destructiveness of useful birds, without any extenuating circumstances worth mentioning. Four of these are _Cooper's Hawk_, the _Sharp-Shinned Hawk, Pigeon Hawk_ and _Duck Hawk_. Fortunately these species are not so numerous that we need lose any sleep over them. Indeed, I think that today it would be a mighty good collector who could find one specimen in seven days' hunting. Like all other species, these, too, are being shot out of our bird fauna. Several species of bird-eating birds are trembling in the balance, and under grave suspicion. Some of them are the _Great Horned Owl, Screech Owl, Butcher Bird_ or _Great Northern Shrike_. The only circumstance that saves these birds from instant condemnation is the delightful amount of rats, mice, moles, gophers and noxious insects that they annually consume. In view of the awful destructiveness of the accursed bubonic-plague-carrying rat, we are impelled to think long before placing in our killing list even the great horned owl, who really does levy a heavy tax on our upland game birds. As to the butcher bird, we feel that we ought to kill him, but in view of his record on wild mice and rats, we hesitate, and finally decline. [Illustration: SHARP-SHINNED HAWK A Species to be Destroyed] SNAKES.--Mr. Thomas M. Upp, a close and long observer of wild things wishes it distinctly understood that while the common black-snakes and racers are practically harmless to birds, the _Pilot Black-Snake_, --long, thick and truculent,--is a great scourge to nesting birds. It seems to be deserving of death. Mr. Upp speaks from personal knowledge, and his condemnation of the species referred to is quite sweeping. At the same time Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars points out the fact that this serpent feeds during 6 months of the year on mice, and in doing so renders good service. In the South it is called the ""Mouse Snake."" [Illustration: THE CAT THAT KILLED 58 BIRDS IN ONE YEAR From Mr. Forbush's Book Photo by A.C. Dyke] * * * * * CHAPTER IX THE DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY DISEASES Every cause that has the effect of reducing the total of wild-life population is now a matter of importance to mankind. The violent and universal disturbance of the balance of Nature that already has taken place throughout the temperate and frigid zone offers not only food for thought, but it calls for vigorous action. There are vast sections in the populous centres of western civilization where the destruction of species, even to the point of extermination, is fairly inevitable. It is the way of Christian man to destroy all wild life that comes within the sphere of influence of his iron heel. With the exception of the big game, this destruction is largely a temperamental result, peculiar to the highest civilization. In India where the same fields have been plowed for wheat and dahl and raggi for at least 2,000 years, the Indian antelope, or ""black buck,"" the saras crane and the adjutant stalk through the crops, and the nilgai and gazelle inhabit the eroded ravines in an agricultural land that averages 1,200 people to the square mile! We have seen that even in farming country, where mud villages are as thick as farm houses in Nebraska, wild animals and even hoofed game can live and hold their own through hundreds of years of close association with man. The explanation is that the Hindus regard wild animals as creatures entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and they are not anxious to shoot every wild animal that shows its head. In the United States, nearly every game-inhabited community is animated by a feeling that every wild animal must necessarily be killed as soon as seen; and this sentiment often leads to disgraceful things. For instance, in some parts of New England a deer straying into a town is at once beset by the hue and cry, and it is chased and assaulted until it is dead, by violent and disgraceful means. New York State, however, seems to have outgrown that spirit. During the past ten years, at least a dozen deer in distress have been rescued from the Hudson River, or in inland towns, or in barnyards in the suburbs of Yonkers and New York, and carefully cared for until ""the zoo people"" could be communicated with. Last winter about 13 exhausted grebes and one loon were picked up, cared for and finally shipped with tender care to the Zoological Park. One distressed dovekie was picked up, but failed to survive. The sentiment for the conservation of wild life has changed the mental attitude of very many people. The old Chinese-Malay spirit which cries ""Kill! Kill!"" and at once runs amuck among suddenly discovered wild animals, is slowly being replaced by a more humane and intelligent sentiment. This is one of the hopeful and encouraging signs of the times. The destruction of wild animals by natural causes is an interesting subject, even though painful. We need to know how much destruction is wrought by influences wholly beyond the control of man, and a few cases must be cited. RINDERPEST IN AFRICA.--Probably the greatest slaughter ever wrought upon wild animals by diseases during historic times, was by rinderpest, a cattle plague which afflicted Africa in the last decade of the previous century. Originally, the disease reached Africa by way of Egypt, and came as an importation from Europe. From Egypt it steadily traveled southward, reaching Somaliland in 1889. In 1896 it reached the Zambesi River and entered Rhodesia. From thence it went on southward almost to the Cape. Not only did it sweep away ninety percent of the native cattle but it also destroyed more than seventy-five per cent of the buffalos, antelopes and other hoofed game of Rhodesia. It was feared that many species would be completely exterminated, but happily that fear was not realized. The buffalo and antelope herds were fifteen years in breeding up again to a reasonable number, but thanks to the respite from hunters which they enjoyed for several years, finally they did recover. Throughout British East Africa the supply of big game in 1905 was very great, but since that time it has been very greatly diminished by shooting. CARIBOU DISEASE.--From time to time reports have come from the Province of Quebec, and I think from Maine and New Brunswick also, of many caribou having died of disease. The nature of that disease has remained a mystery, because it seems that no pathologist ever has had an opportunity to investigate it. Fortunately, however, the alleged disease never has been sufficiently wide-spread or continuous to make appreciable inroads on the total number of caribou, and apparently the trouble has been local. SCAB IN MOUNTAIN SHEEP.--""Scab"" is a contagious and persistent skin disease that affects sheep, and is destructive when not controlled. Fifteen years ago it prevailed in some portions of the west. In Colorado it has several times been reported that many bighorn mountain sheep were killed by ""scab,"" which was contracted on wild mountain pastures that had been gone over by domestic sheep carrying that disease. From the reports current at that time, we inferred that about 200 mountain sheep had been affected. It was feared that the disease would spread through the wild flocks and become general, but this did not occur. It seems that the remnant flocks had become so isolated from one another that the isolation of the affected flocks saved the others. LUMPY-JAW IN ANTELOPE AND SHEEP.--It is a lamentable fact that some, at least, of the United States herds of prong-horned antelope are afflicted with a very deadly chronic infective disease known as actinomycosis, or lumpy-jaw. It has been brought into the Zoological Park five times, by specimens shipped from Colorado, Texas, Wyoming and Montana. I think our first cases came to us in 1902. In its early stage this disease is so subtle and slow that it is months in developing; and this feature renders it all the more deadly, through the spread of infection long before the ailment can be discovered. One of our antelope arrivals, apparently in perfect health when received, was on general principles kept isolated in rigid quarantine for two months. At the expiration of that period, no disease of any kind having become manifest, the animal was placed on exhibition, with two others that had been in the Park for more than a year, in perfect health. In one more week the late arrival developed a swelling on its jaw, drooled at the corner of the mouth, and became feverish,--sure symptoms of the dread disease. At once it was removed and isolated, but in about 10 days it died. The other two antelopes were promptly attacked, and eventually died. The course of the disease is very intense, and thus far it has proven incurable in our wild animals. We have lost about 10 antelopes from it, and one deer, usually, in each case, within ten days or two weeks from the discovery of the first outward sign,--the well known swelling on the jaw. One case that was detected immediately upon arrival was very persistently treated by Dr. Blair, and the animal actually survived for four months, but finally it succumbed. From first to last not a single case was cured. In 1912, the future of the prong-horned antelope in real captivity seems hopeless. We have decided not to bring any more specimens to our institution, partly because all available candidates seem reasonably certain to be affected with lumpy-jaw, and partly because we are unwilling to run further risks of having other hoofed animals inoculated by them. Today we are anxiously wondering whether the jaw disease of the prong-horn is destined to exterminate the species. Such a catastrophe is much to be feared. This is probably one of the reasons why the antelope is steadily disappearing, despite protection. In 1906 we discovered the existence of actinomycosis among the black mountain sheep of northern British Columbia. Two specimens out of six were badly affected, the bones of the jaws being greatly enlarged, and perforated by deep pits. The black sheep of the Stickine and Iskoot regions are so seldom seen by white men, save when a sportsman kills his allotment of three specimens, we really do not know anything about the extent to which actinomycosis prevails in those herds, or how deadly are its effects. One thing seems quite certain, from the appearance of the diseased skulls found by the writer in the taxidermic laboratory of Frederick Sauter, in New York. The enormous swelling of the diseased jaw bones clearly indicates a disease that in some cases affects its victim throughout many months. Such a condition as we found in those sheep could not have been reached in a few days after the disease became apparent. Now, in our antelopes, the collapse and death of the victim usually occurred in about 10 days from the time that the first swelling was observed: which means a very virulent disease, and rapid progress at the climax. The jaw of one of our antelopes, which was figured in Dr. Blair's paper in the Eleventh Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society (1906) shows only a very slight lesion, in comparison with those of the mountain sheep. The conclusion is that among the sheep, this disease does not carry off its victims in any short period like 10 days. The animal must survive for some months after it becomes apparent. At least two parties of American sportsmen have shot rams afflicted with this disease, but I have no reports of any sheep having been found dead from this cause. This disease is well known among domestic cattle, but so far as we are aware it never before has been found among wild animals. The black sheep herds wherein it was found in British Columbia are absolutely isolated from domestic cattle and all their influences, and therefore it seems quite certain that the disease developed among the sheep spontaneously,--a remarkable episode, to say the least. Whether it will exterminate the black mountain sheep species, and in time spread to the white sheep of the northwest, is of course a matter of conjecture; but there is nothing in the world to prevent a calamity of that kind. The white sheep of Yukon Territory range southward until in the Sheslay Mountains they touch the sphere of influence of the black sheep, where the disease could easily be transmitted. It would be a good thing if there existed between the two species a sheepless zone about 200 miles wide. I greatly fear that actinomycosis is destined to play an important part in the final extinction that seems to be the impending fate of the beautiful and valuable prong-horned antelope. In view of our hard experiences, extending through ten years (1902-1912), I think this fear is justified. All persons who live in country still inhabited by antelope are urged to watch for this disease. If any antelopes are found dead, see if the lower jaw is badly swollen and discharging pus. If it is, bury the body quickly, burn the ground over, and advise the writer regarding the case. THE RABBIT PLAGUE.--One of the strangest freaks of Nature of which we know as effecting the wholesale destruction of wild animals by disease is the rabbit plague. In the northern wilderness, and particularly central Canada, where rabbits exist in great numbers and supply the wants of a large carnivorous population, this plague is well known, and among trappers and woodsmen is a common topic of conversation. The best treatment of the subject is to be found in Ernest T. Seton's ""Life Histories of Northern Animals"", Vol. I, p. 640 et seq. From this I quote: ""Invariably the year of greatest numbers [of rabbits] is followed by a year of plague, which sweeps them away, leaving few or no rabbits in the land. The denser the rabbit population, the more drastically is it ravaged by the plague. They are wiped out in a single spring by epidemic diseases usually characterized by swellings of the throat, sores under the armpits and groins, and by diarrhea."" ""The year 1885 was for the country around Carberry 'a rabbit year,' the greatest ever known in that country. The number of rabbits was incredible. W.R. Hine killed 75 in two hours, and estimated that he could have killed 500 in a day. The farmers were stricken with fear that the rabbit pest of Australia was to be repeated in Manitoba. But the years 1886-7 changed all that. The rabbits died until their bodies dotted the country in thousands. The plague seemed to kill all the members of the vast host of 1885."" The strangest item of Mr. Seton's story is yet to be told. In 1890 Mr. Seton stocked his park at Cos Cob, Conn., with hares and rabbits from several widely separated localities. In 1903, the plague came and swept them all away. Mr. Seton sent specimens to the Zoological Park for examination by the Park veterinary surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair. They were found to be infested by great numbers of a dangerous bloodsucking parasite known as _Strongylus strigosus_, which produces death by anemia and emaciation. There were hundreds of those parasites in each animal. I assisted in the examination, and was shown by Dr. Blair, under the microscope, that _Strongylus_ puts forth eggs literally by hundreds of thousands! The life history of that parasite is not well known, but it may easily develop that the cycle of its maximum destructiveness is seven years, and therefore it may be accountable for the seven-year plague among the hares and rabbits of the northern United States and Canada. Possibly _Strongylus strigosus_ is all that stands between Canada and a pest of rabbits like that of Australia. Just why this parasite is inoperative in Australia, or why it has not been introduced there to lessen the rabbit evil, we do not know. Mr. Seton declares that the rabbits of his park were ""subject to all the ills of the flesh, except possibly writer's paralysis and housemaid's knee."" PARASITIC INFECTION OF WILD DUCKS.--The diseases of wild game, especially waterfowl, grouse and quail, have caused heavy losses in America as well as in European countries, and scientists have been carefully investigating the cause and the general nature of the maladies, as well as probable methods of prevention and cure. Mr. Geo. Atkinson, a well-known practical naturalist of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, writes as follows to a local paper on this subject, which I find quoted in the _National Sportsman_: The question which has developed these important proportions during the past year is that of the extent of the parasitic infection of our wild ducks and other game, and the possibilities of the extended transmission of these parasites to domestic stock, or even humanity, by eating. The parasites in question are contained in small elliptical cases found underlying the surface muscles of the breast, and in advanced cases extending deeper into the flesh and the muscular tissues of the legs and wings. They are not noticeable in the ordinary process of plucking the bird for the table, and are not found internally, so that the only method of discovering their presence is by slitting the skin of the breast and paring it back a few inches when the worm-like sacs will be seen buried in the flesh. These parasites have come to my notice periodically during the process of skinning birds for mounting during the past number of years, but it was only when they appeared in unusual numbers last fall that I made inquiries of the biological bureaus of Washington and Ottawa for information of their life history and the possibilities of their transmission to other hosts. Replies from these sources surprised me with the information that very little was known of the life history of any of the Sarcosporidia, of which group this was a species. Nothing was known of the method of infection or the transference from host to host or species to species, and both departments asked for specimens for examination. Authorities are a unit in opinion that the question is one of great importance to game conservation, and although opinions of the dangers from eating differ somewhat, a record is given of a hog fed upon affected flesh developing parasites in the muscles in six weeks' time, while a case of a man's death from dropsy was found to be the result of development of these parasites in the valves of the heart. The ability of these low forms of life to withstand extremes of heat makes it necessary for more than ordinary cooking to be assured of killing them, and since their presence is unnoted in the ordinary course of dressing the birds for the table, there is little doubt that very considerable numbers of these parasites are consumed at our tables every season, with results at present unknown to us. The species I have found most particularly infected have been mallards, shovellers, teal, gadwall and pintails, and the birds, outwardly in the best condition, have frequently been found loaded with sacs of these parasites and only the turning back of the breast skin can disclose their presence. The greatest slaughter of wild ducks by disease occurred on Great Salt Lake, Utah. Until the ""duck disease"" (intestinal coccidiosis) broke out there, in the summer of 1910, the annual market slaughter of ducks at the mouth of Bear River had been enormous. When at Salt Lake City in 1888 I made an effort to arouse the sportsmen whom I met to the necessity of a reform, but my exhortations fell on deaf ears. Naturally, the sweeping away of the remaining ducks by disease would suggest a heaven-sent judgment upon the slaughterers were it not for the fact that the last state of the unfortunate ducks is if anything worse than the first. On Oct. 17, 1911, the annual report of the chief of the Biological Survey contained the following information on this subject: _Epidemic Among Wild Ducks on Great Salt Lake_.--Following a long dry season, which favored the rearing of a large number of wild ducks, but materially reduced the area of the feeding ponds, resulting in great overcrowding, a severe epidemic broke out about August 1, 1910, among the wild ducks about Great Salt Lake, Utah. Dead ducks could be counted by thousands along the shores and the disease raged unabated until late fall. Shooting clubs found it necessary to declare a closed season. Some of the dead ducks were forwarded to the Biological Survey and were turned over for examination to the Bureau of Animal Industry, by the experts of which the disease was diagnosed as intestinal coccidiosis. Various plans of relieving the situation were tried. The irrigation ditches were closed, thus providing the sloughs and ponds with fresh water, and lime was sprinkled on the mud flats and duck trails. Great improvement followed this treatment, and experiments proved that ducks provided with abundant fresh water and clean food began to recover immediately. These methods promised success, but later it was proposed that the marshes be drained and exposed to the sun's rays--a course which cannot be recommended. That coccidia are not always killed by exposure to the sun is shown by their survival on the sites of old chicken yards. An added disadvantage of the plan is that draining and drying the marshes would have a bad effect on the natural duck food, and upon the birds themselves. * * * * * CHAPTER X DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY THE ELEMENTS It is a fixed condition of Nature that whenever and wherever a wild species exists in a state of nature, free from the trammels and limitations that contact with man always imposes, the species is fitted to survive all ordinary climatic influences. Freedom of action, and the exercise of several options in the line of individual maintenance under stress, is essential to the welfare of every wild species. A prong-horned antelope herd that is free can drift before a blizzard, can keep from freezing by the exercise, and eventually come to shelter. Let that same herd drift against a barbed-wire fence five miles long, and its whole scheme of self-preservation is upset. The herd perishes then and there. Cut out the undergrowth of a given section, drain the swamps and mow down all the weeds and tall grass, and the next particularly hard winter starves and freezes the quail. Naturally the cutting of forests, clearing of brush and drainage of marshes is more or less calamitous to all the species of birds that inhabit such places and find there winter food and shelter. Red-winged blackbirds and real estate booms can not inhabit the same swamps contemporaneously. Before the relentless march of civilization, the wild Indian, the bison and many of the wild birds must inevitably disappear. We cannot change conditions that are as inexorable as death itself. The wild life must either adjust itself to the conditions that civilized man imposes upon it, or perish. I say ""civilized man,"" for the reason that the primitive races of man are not deadly exterminators of species, as we are. I know of not one species of wild life that has been exterminated by savage man without the aid of his civilized peers. As civilization marches ever onward, over the prairies, into the bad lands and the forests, over the mountains and even into the farthest corner of Death Valley, the desert of deserts, the struggle of the wild birds, mammals and fishes is daily and hourly intensified. Man must help them to maintain themselves, or accept a lifeless continent. The best help consists in letting the wild creatures throughly alone, so that they can help themselves; but quail often need to be fed in critical periods. The best food is wheat screenings placed under little tents of straw, bringing food and shelter together. In the well settled portions of the United States, such species as quail, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, pinnated grouse and sage grouse hang to life by slender threads. A winter of exceptionally deep snows, much sleet, and a late spring always causes grave anxiety among the state game wardens. In Pennsylvania a very earnest movement is in progress to educate and persuade farmers to feed the quail in winter, and much good is being done in that direction. Mr. Erasmus Wilson, of the _Pittsburgh Gazette-Times_ is the apostle of that movement. _Quail should be fed every winter, in every northern state_. The methods to be pursued will be mentioned elsewhere. By way of illustration, here is a sample game report, from Las Animas, Colorado, Feb. 22, 1912: ""After the most severe winter weather experienced for twenty years we are able to compute approximately our loss of feathered life. It is seventy-five per cent of the quail throughout the irrigated district, and about twenty per cent of meadow-larks. In the rough cedar-covered sections south of the Arkansas River, the loss among the quail was much lighter. The ground sparrows suffered severely, while the English sparrow seems to have come through in good shape. Many cotton-tail rabbits starved to death, while the deep, light snow of January made them easy prey for hawks and coyotes."" (F.T. Webber). It would be possible to record many instances similar to the above, but why multiply them? And now behold the cruel corollary: At least twenty-five times during the past two years I have heard and read arguments by sportsmen against my proposal for a 5-year close season for quail, taking the ground that ""The sportsmen are not wholly to blame for the scarcity of quail. It is the cold winters that kill them off!"" So then, _because the fierce winters murder the bob white, wholesale, they should not have a chance to recover themselves_! Could human beings possibly assume a more absurd attitude? Yes, it is coldly and incontestably true, that even after such winter slaughter as Mr. Webber has reported above, the very next season will find the quail hunter joyously taking the field, his face beaming with health and good living, to hunt down and shoot to death as many as possible of the pitiful 25 per cent remnant that managed to survive the pitiless winter. How many quail hunters, think you, ever stayed their hands because of ""a hard winter on the quail?"" I warrant not one out of every hundred! How many states in this Union ever put on a close season because of a hard winter? I'll warrant that not one ever did; and I think there is only one state whose game commissioners have the power to act in that way without recourse to the legislature. This situation is intolerable. Thanks to the splendid codified game laws enacted in New York state in 1912, our Conservation Commission can declare a close season in any locality, for any length of time, when the state of the game demands an emergency measure. This act is as follows; and it is a model law, which every other state should speedily enact: * * * * * THE NEW YORK CLOSE-SEASON LAW. _152. Petition for additional protection; notice of hearings; power to grant additional protection; notice of prohibition or regulation; penalties_. _1. Petition for additional protection_. Any citizen of the state may file with the commission a petition in writing requesting it to give any species of fish, other than migratory food fish of the sea, or game protected by law, additional or other protection than that afforded by the provisions of this article. Such petition shall state the grounds upon which such protection is considered necessary, and shall be signed by the petitioner with his address. _2. Notice of hearings_. The commission shall hold a public hearing in the locality or county to be affected upon the allegations of such petition within twenty days from the filing thereof. At least ten days prior to such hearing notice thereof, stating the time and place at which such hearing shall be held, shall be advertised in a newspaper published in the county to be affected by such additional or other protection. Such notice shall state the name and the address of the petitioner, together with a brief statement of the grounds upon which such application is made, and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the petitioner at the address given in such petition at least ten days before such hearing. _3. Power to grant additional protection_. If upon such hearing the commission shall determine that such species of fish or game, by reason of disease, danger of extermination, or from any other cause or reason, requires such additional or other protection, in any locality or throughout the state, the commission shall have power to prohibit or regulate, during the open season therefor, the taking of such species of fish or game. Such prohibition or regulation may be made general throughout the state or confined to a particular part or district thereof. _4. Notice of prohibition or regulation_. Any order made by the commission under the provisions of this section shall be signed by it, and entered in its minute book. At least thirty days before such prohibition or regulation shall take effect, copies of the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk issuing hunting and trapping licenses for the district to which the prohibition or regulation applies. It shall be the duty of said clerks to issue a copy of said prohibition or regulation to each person to whom a hunting or trapping license is issued by them; to mail a copy of such prohibition or regulation to each holder of a hunting and trapping license theretofore issued by them and at that time in effect, and to post a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in their office. At least thirty days before such prohibition or regulation shall take effect the commission shall cause a notice thereof to be advertised in a newspaper published in the county wherein such prohibition or regulation shall take effect. _5. Penalties_. Any person violating the provisions of such prohibition, rule or regulation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not to exceed one hundred dollars, or shall be imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both, for each offense, in addition to the penalties hereinafter provided for taking fish, birds or quadrupeds in the close season. * * * * * I want all sensible, honest sportsmen to stop citing the killing of game birds by severe winters _as a reason_ why long close seasons are not necessary, and why automatic guns ""don't matter."" And I want sportsmen to consider their duty, and not go out hunting any game species that has been slaughtered by a hard winter, until it has had at least five years in which to recover. Any other course is cruel, selfish, and shortsighted; and a word to the humane should be sufficient. The worst exhibitions ever made of the wolfish instinct to slay that springs eternal in some human (!) breasts are those brought about through the distress or errors of wild animals. By way of illustration, consider the slaughter of half-starved elk that took place in the edge of Idaho in the winter of 1909 and 1910, when about seven hundred elk that were driven out of the Yellowstone Park at its northwestern corner by the deep snow, fled into Idaho in the hope of finding food. The inhabitants met the starving herds with repeating rifles, and as the unfortunate animals struggled westward through the snow and storm, they were slaughtered without mercy. Bulls and cows, old and young, all of the seven hundred, went down; and Stoney Indians could not have acted any worse than did those ""settlers."" On another occasion, it is recorded that the prong-horned antelope herd of the Mammoth Hot Springs wandered across the line into Gardiner, and quickly met a savage attack of gunners with rifles. A number of those rare and valuable animals were killed, and others fled back into the Park with broken legs dangling in the air. In the interest of public decency, and for the protection of the reputation of American citizenship, one of two things should be done. The northern boundary of the Park should be extended northward beyond Gardiner, or else the deathtrap should be moved elsewhere. The case of the town of Gardiner is referred to the legislature of Montana for treatment. Beyond question, the highest sentiments of humanity are those that are stirred by the misfortunes of killable game. During the past thirty years, I have noticed some interesting manifestations of the increased sympathy for wild creatures that steadily is growing in a large section of the public mind. Thirty years ago, the appearance of a deer or moose in the streets of any eastern village nearly always was in itself a signal for a grand chase of the unfortunate creature, and its speedy slaughter. Today, in the eastern states, the general feeling is quite different. The appearance of a deer in the Hudson River itself, or a moose in a Maine village is a signal, not for a wild chase and cruel slaughter, but for a general effort to save the animal from being hurt, or killed. I know this through ocular proof, at least half a dozen lost and bewildered deer having been carefully driven into yards, or barns, and humanely kept and cared for until they could be shipped to us. Several have been caught while swimming in the Hudson, bewildered and panic-stricken. The latest capture occurred in New York City itself. A puma that escaped (about 1902) from the Zoological Park, instead of being shot was captured by sensible people in the hamlet of Bronxdale, alive and unhurt, and safely returned to us. In some portions of the east, though not all, the day of the hue and cry over ""a wild animal in town"" seems to be about over. On Long Island some humane persons found an injured turkey vulture, and took it in and cared for it,--only to be persecuted by ill-advised game wardens, because they had a forbidden wild bird ""in their possession!"" There are times when it is the highest (moral) duty of a game warden to follow the advice of Private Mulvaney to the ""orficer boy,"" and ""Shut yer oye to the rigulations, sorr!"" Such occurrences as these are becoming more and more common. _The desire of ""the great silent majority"" is to SAVE the wild creatures_; and it is in response to that sentiment that thousands of people are today in the field against the Army of Destruction. It is the duty of every sportsman to assist in promoting the passage of a law like our New York law which empowers the State Game Commission to throw extra protection around any species that has been slaughtered too much by snow or by firearms, by closing the open season as long as may be necessary. Can there be in all America even one thinking, reasoning being who can not see the justice and also the imperative necessity of this measure? It seems impossible. Give the game the benefit of every doubt! If it becomes too thick, your gun can quickly thin it out; but if it is once exterminated, it will be impossible to bring it back. Be wise; and take thought for the morrow. Remember the heath hen. SLAUGHTER OF BLUEBIRDS.--In the late winter and early spring of 1896 the wave of bluebirds was caught on its northward migration by a period of unseasonably cold and fearfully tempestuous weather, involving much icy-cold rain and sleet. Now, there is no other climatic condition that is so hard for a wild bird or mammal to withstand as rain at the freezing point, and a mantle of ice or frozen snow over all supplies of food. The bluebirds perished by thousands. The loss occurred practically all along their east-and-west line of migration, from Arkansas to the Atlantic Coast. In places the species seemed almost exterminated; and it was several years ere it recovered to a point even faintly approximating its original population. I am quite certain that the species never has recovered more than 50 per cent of the number that existed previous to the calamity. DUCK CHOLERA IN THE BRONX RIVER.--In 1911, some unknown but new and particularly deadly element, probably introduced in sewage, contaminated the waters of Bronx River where it flows through New York City, with results very fatal in the Zoological Park. The large flock of mallard ducks, Canada geese, and snow geese on Lake Agassiz was completely wiped out. In all about 125 waterfowl died in rapid succession, from causes commonly classed under the popular name of ""duck cholera."" The disease was carried to other bodies of water in the Park that were fed from other sources, but made no headway elsewhere than on lakes fed by the polluted Bronx River. Fortunately the work of the Bronx River Parkway Commission soon will terminate the present very unsanitary condition of that stream. WILD DUCKS IN DISTRESS.--In the winter of 1911-12, many flocks of wild ducks decided to winter in the North. Many persons believe that this was largely due to the prevention of late winter and spring shooting; which seems reasonable. Unfortunately the winter referred to proved exceptionally severe and formed vast sheets of thick ice over the feeding-grounds where the ducks had expected to obtain their food. On Cayuga, Seneca and other lakes in central New York, and on the island of Martha's Vineyard, the flocks of ducks suffered very severely, and many perished of hunger and cold. _But for the laws prohibiting late winter shooting undoubtedly all of them would have been shot and eaten, regardless of their distress_. Game wardens and humane citizens made numerous efforts to feed the starving flocks, and many ducks were saved in that way. An illustrated article on the distressed ducks of Keuka Lake, by C. William Beebe and Verdi Burtch, appeared in the _Zoological Society Bulletin_ for May, 1912. Fortunately there is every reason to believe that such occurrences will be rare. WILD SWANS SWEPT OVER NIAGARA FALLS.--During the past ten years, several winter tragedies to birds have occurred on a large scale at Niagara Falls. Whole flocks of whistling swans of from 20 up to 70 individuals alighting in the Niagara River above the rapids have permitted themselves to float down into the rapids, and be swept over the Falls, en masse. On each occasion, the great majority of the birds were drowned, or killed on the rocks. Of the very few that survived, few if any were able to rise and fly out of the gorge below the Falls to safety. It is my impression that about 200 swans recently have perished in this strange way. * * * * * CHAPTER XI SLAUGHTER OF SONG-BIRDS BY ITALIANS In these days of wild-life slaughter, we hear much of death and destruction. Before our eyes there continually arise photographs of hanging masses of waterfowl, grouse, pheasants, deer and fish, usually supported in true heraldic fashion by the men who slew them and the implements of slaughter. The world has become somewhat hardened to these things, because the victims are classed as game; and in the destruction of game, one game-bag more or less ""Will not count in the news of the battle."" The slaughter of song, insectivorous and all other birds by Italians and other aliens from southern Europe has become a scourge to the bird life of this country. The devilish work of the negroes and poor whites of the South will be considered in the next chapter. In Italy, linnets and sparrows are ""game""; and so is everything else that wears feathers! Italy is a continuous slaughtering-ground for the migratory birds of Europe, and as such it is an international nuisance and a pest. The way passerine birds are killed and eaten in that country is a disgrace to the government of Italy, and a standing reproach to the throne. Even kings and parliaments have no right in moral or international law to permit year after year the wholesale slaughter of birds of passage of species that no civilized man has a right to kill. There are some tales of slaughter from which every properly-balanced Christian mind is bound to recoil with horror. One such tale has recently been given to us in the pages of the _Avicultural Magazine_, of London, for January, 1912, by Mr. Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., whose word no man will dispute. In condensing it, let us call it * * * * * THE ITALIAN SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS This story does not concern game birds of any kind. Quite the contrary. That it should be published in America, a land now rapidly filling up with Italians, is a painful necessity in order that the people of America may be enabled accurately to measure the fatherland traditions and the fixed mental attitude of Italians generally toward our song birds. I shall now hold a mirror up to Italian nature. If the image is either hideous or grotesque, the fault will not be mine. I specially commend the picture to the notice of American game wardens and judges on the bench. The American reader must be reminded that the Italian peninsula reaches out a long arm of land into the Mediterranean Sea for several hundred miles toward the sunny Barbary coast of North Africa. This great southward highway has been chosen by the birds of central Europe as their favorite migration route. Especially is this true of the small song-birds with weak wings and a minimum of power for long-sustained flight. Naturally, they follow the peninsula down to the Italian Land's End before they launch forth to dare the passage of the Mediterranean. [Illustration: AN ITALIAN ROCCOLO, ON LAKE COMO A Death-Trap for Song-Birds. From the Avicultural Magazine] Italy is the narrow end of a great continental funnel, into the wide northern end of which Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland annually pour their volume of migratory bird life. And what is the result? For answer let us take the testimony of two reliable witnesses, and file it for use on the day when Tony Macchewin, gun in hand and pockets bulging with cartridges, goes afield in our country and opens fire on our birds. The linnet is one of the sweet singers of Europe. It is a small, delicately formed, weak-winged little bird, about the size of our phoebe-bird. It weighs only a trifle more than a girl's love-letter. Where it breeds and rears its young, in Germany for example, a true sportsman would no more think of shooting a linnet than he would of killing and eating his daughter's dearest canary. To the migrating bird, the approach to northern Italy, either going or returning, is not through a land of plenty. The sheltering forests have mostly been swept away, and safe shelters for small birds are very rare. In the open, there are owls and hawks; and the only refuge from either is the thick-leafed grove, into which linnets and pipits can dive at the approach of danger and quickly hide. A linnet from the North after days of dangerous travel finally reached Lake Como, southward bound. The country was much too open for safety, and its first impulse was to look about for safe shelter. The low bushes that sparsely covered the steep hillsides were too thin for refuge in times of sudden danger. Ah! Upon a hilltop is a little grove of trees, green and inviting. In the grove a bird is calling, calling, insistently. The trees are very small; but they seem to stand thickly together, and their foliage should afford a haven from both hawk and gunner. To it joyously flits the tired linnet. As it perches aloft upon a convenient whip-like wand, it notices for the first time a queer, square brick tower of small dimensions, rising in the center of a court-yard surrounded by trees. The tower is like an old and dingy turret that has been shorn from a castle, and set on the hilltop without apparent reason. It is two stories in height, with one window, dingy and uninviting. A door opens into its base. Several birds that seem very near, but are invisible, frequently call and chirp, as if seeking answering calls and companionship. Surely the grove must be a safe place for birds, or they would not be here. Hark! A whirring, whistling sound fills the air, like the air tone of a flying hawk's wings. A hawk! A hawk! Down plunges the scared linnet, blindly, frantically, into the space sheltered by the grove! Horrors! What is this? Threads! Invisible, interlacing threads; tangled and full of pockets, treacherously spanning the open space. It is a fowler's net! The linnet is entangled. It flutters frantically but helplessly, and hangs there, caught. Its alarm cry is frantically answered by the two strange, invisible bird voices that come from the top of the tower! The grove and the tower are A ROCCOLO! A huge, permanent, merciless, deadly _trap_, for the wholesale capture of songbirds! The tower is the hiding place of the fowler, and the calling birds are decoy birds whose eyes have been totally blinded by red-hot wires in order that they will call more frantically than birds with eyes would do. The whistling wings that seemed a hawk were a sham, made by a racquet thrown through the air by the fowler, through a slot in his tower. He keeps by him many such racquets. The door of the tower opens, and out comes the fowler. He is lowbrowed, swarthy, ill kept, and wears rings in his ears. A soiled hand seizes the struggling linnet, and drags it violently from the threads that entangled it. A sharp-pointed twig is thrust straight through the head of the helpless victim _at the eyes_, and after one wild, fluttering agony--it is dead. The fowler sighs contentedly, re-enters his dirty and foul-smelling tower, tosses the feathered atom upon the pile of dead birds that lies upon the dirty floor in a dirty corner,--and is ready for the next one. Ask him, as did Mr. Astley, and he will tell you frankly that there are about 150 dead birds in the pile,--starlings, sparrows, linnets, greenfinches, chaffinches, goldfinches, hawfinches, redstarts, blackcaps, robins, song thrushes, blackbirds, blue and coal tits, fieldfares and redwings. He will tell you also, that there are _seven other roccolos within sight and twelve within easy walking distance_. He will tell you, as he did Mr. Astley, that during that week he had taken about 500 birds, and that that number was a fair average for each of the 12 other roccolos. This means the destruction of about 5,000 songbirds per week _in that neighborhood alone!_ Another keeper of a roccolo told Mr. Astley that during the previous autumn he took about 10,000 birds at his small and comparatively insignificant roccolo. And above that awful roccolo of slaughtered innocents rose _a wooden cross_, in memory of Christ, the Merciful, the Compassionate! Around the interior of the entwined sapling tops that formed the fatal bower of death there hung a semicircle of tiny cages containing live decoys,--chaffinches, hawfinches, titmice and several other species. ""The older and staider ones call repeatedly,"" says Mr. Astley, ""and the chaffinches break into song. It is the only song to be heard in Italy at the time of the autum migration."" And the King of Italy, the Queen of Italy, the Parliament of Italy and His Holiness the Pope permit these things, year in and year out. It is now said, however, that through the efforts of a recently organized bird-lovers' society in Italy, the blinding of decoy birds for roccolos is to be stopped. In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the protection of these birds during their breeding season must be very effective, for otherwise the supply for the Italian slaughter of the Innocents would long ago have fallen to nothing. The Germans love birds, and all wild life. I wonder how they like the Italian roccolo. I wonder how France regards it; and whether the nations of Europe north of Italy will endure this situation forever. To the American and English reader, comment on the practices recorded above is quite unnecessary, except the observation that they betoken a callousness of feeling and a depth of cruelty and destructiveness to which, so far as known, no savages ever yet have sunk. As an exhibit of the groveling pusillanimity of the human soul, the roccolo of northern Italy reveals minus qualities which can not be expressed either in words or in figures. And what is the final exhibit of the gallant knight of the roccolo, the feudal lord of the modern castle and its retainers? The answer is given by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, in an article on ""Birds in the Markets of Southern Europe."" In Venice, which was visited in October and November, during the fall migration, he found on sale in the markets, as food, thousands of songbirds. ""Birds were there in profusion, from ducks to kites, in the early morning, hung in great bunches above the stalls, but by 9 A.M. most of them had been sold. Ducks and shorebirds occurred in some numbers, but the vast majority were small sparrows, larks and thrushes. These were there during my visit by the thousands, if not ten thousands. To the market they were brought in large sacks, strung in fours on twigs which had been passed through the eyes and then tied. Most of these small birds had been trapped, and on skinning them I often could find no injury except at their eyes.[C] One of these sacks which I examined on November 3, contained hundreds of birds, largely siskins, skylarks and bramblings. As a rule the small birds that were not sold in the early morning were skinned or picked, and their tiny bodies packed in regular order, breasts up, in shadow tin boxes, and exposed for sale."" [Footnote C: It is probable that these birds were killed by piercing the head through the eyes.] ""During these visits to the Venetian markets, I identified 60 species, and procured specimens of most. As nearly as I can remember, small birds cost from two to five cents apiece. For example I paid $2.15 on Nov. 8, for 1 Woodcock, 1 Skylark, 1 Jay, 1 Greenfinch, 2 Starlings, 1 Bullfinch, 2 Spotted Crakes, 1 Redpoll. 1 Song Thrush, 3 Linnets, 1 Gold-Crest, 2 Goldfinches, 1 Long-Tailed Titmouse, 6 Siskins, 1 Great Titmouse, 3 Reed Buntings, 1 Pipit, 3 Bramblings, 1 Redstart, --and 5 Chaffinches. ""On November 10, I paid $3.25 for 2 Coots, 1 European Curlew, 1 Water Rail, 2 Kingfishers, 1 Spotted Crake, 2 Greenfinches, 1 Sparrow Hawk, 2 Wrens, 2 Woodcock, 2 Great Titmouse, 1 Common Redshank, 2 Blue Titmouse, 1 Dusky Redshank, 1 Redbreast, and 2 Dunlins."" Of course there were various species of upland game birds, shore-birds and waterfowl,--everything, in fact, that could be found and killed. In addition to the passerine birds listed above. Dr. Bishop noted the following, all in Venice alone: Skylark (""in great numbers""), Crested Lark, Crossbill, Calandra, House Sparrow, Tree Sparrow, Stonechat, Hawfinch, Coal, Yellow-Hammer, Goldcrest, Blackbird, Rock Pipit, Fieldfare, White Wagtail, Song Thrush, Redwing. ""In Florence,"" says Dr. Bishop, ""I visited the central market on November 26, 28, 29, 30, December 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and found birds even more plentiful than in Venice."" Besides a variety of game birds, he found quantities of the species mentioned above, seen in Venice, and also the following: Green Sandpiper, Brown Creeper, Dotterel, Nuthatch, Magpie, Black-Cap Warbler, Corn Bunting, Black-Headed Warbler, Migratory Quail, Fantail Warbler, Green Woodpecker, Missel Thrush, Spotted Woodpecker, Ring Ouzel, Wood Lark, Rock Sparrow, and Gray Wagtail. ""Here, too [at Florence] we saw often, bunches and baskets of small birds, chiefly redbreasts, hawked through the streets.... Every Sunday that we went into the country we met numbers of Italians out shooting, and their bags seemed to consist wholly of small birds. ""At Genoa, San Remo, Monte Carlo and Nice, between December 13 and 29, I did not visit the central markets, if such exist, but saw frequently bunches of small birds hanging outside stores.... A gentleman who spent the fall on an automobile trip through the west of FRANCE _from Brittany to the Pyrenees, tells me he noticed these bunches of small birds on sale in every town he visited_. ""That killing song-birds for food,"" continues Dr. Bishop, ""is not confined to the poor Italians I learned on October 27, when one of the most prominent and wealthy Italian _ornithologists_--a delightful man--told me he had shot 180 skylarks and pipits the day before, and that his family liked them far better than other game. Our prejudice against selling game does not exist in Europe, and this same ornithologist told me he often shot 200 ducks in a day at his shooting-box, sending to the market what he could not use himself. On November 1, 1910, he shot 82 ducks, and on November 8, 103, chiefly widgeon and teal."" An ""ornithologist"" indeed! A ""sportsman"" also, is he not? He belongs with his brother ""ornithologists"" of the roccolos, who net their ""game"" with the aid of _blind_ birds! Brave men, gallant ""sportsmen,"" are these men of Italy,--and western France also if the tale is true! If the people of Europe can stand the wholesale, systematic slaughter of their song and insectivorous birds, _we can_! If they are too mean-spirited to rise up, make a row about it, and stop it, then let them pay the price; but, by the Eternal, Antonio shall not come to this country with the song-bird tastes of the roccolo and indulge them here! The above facts have been cited, not at all for the benefit of Europe, but for our own good. The American People are now confronted by the Italian and Austrian and Hungarian laborer and saloon-keeper and mechanic, and all Americans should have an exact measure of the sentiments of southern Europe toward our wild life generally, especially the birds that we do not shoot at all, _and therefore are easy to kill_. When a warden or a citizen arrests an alien for killing any of our non-game birds, show the judge these records of how they do things in Italy, and ask for the extreme penalty. I have taken pains to publish the above facts from eye-witnesses in order that every game commissioner, game warden and state legislator who reads these pages may know exactly what he is ""up against"" in the alien population of our country from southern Europe. For unnumbered generations, the people of Italy have been taught to believe that it is _perfectly right_ to shoot and devour every song-bird that flies. The Venetian is no respecter of species; and when an Italian ""ornithologist"" (!) can go out and murder 180 linnets and pipits in one day for the pot, it is time for Americans to think hard. We sincerely hope that it will not require blows and kicks and fines to remove from Antonio's head the idea that America is not Italy, and that the slaughter of song birds ""don't go"" in this country. I strongly recommend to every state the enactment of a law that will do these things: 1.--Prohibit the owning, carrying or use of firearms by aliens, and 2.--Prohibit the use of firearms in hunting by any naturalized alien from southern Europe until after a 10-years' residence in America. From reports that have come to me at first hand regarding Italians in the East, Hungarians in Pennsylvania and Austrians in Minnesota, it seems absolutely certain that all members of the lower classes of southern Europe are a dangerous menace to our wild life. On account of the now-accursed land-of-liberty idea, every foreigner who sails past the statue on Bedloe's Island and lands on our liberty-ridden shore, is firmly convinced that _now, at last_, he can do as he pleases! And as one of his first ways in which to show his newly-acquired personal liberty and independence in the Land of Easy Marks, he buys a gun and goes out to shoot ""free game!"" If we, as a people, are so indolent and so somnolent that Antonio gets away with all our wild birds, then do we deserve to be robbed. Italians are pouring into America in a steady stream. They are strong, prolific, persistent and of tireless energy. New York City now contains 340,000 of them. They work while the native Americans sleep. Wherever they settle, their tendency is to root out the native American and take his place and his income. Toward wild life the Italian laborer is a human mongoose. Give him power to act, and he will quickly exterminate every wild thing that wears feathers or hair. To our songbirds he is literally a ""pestilence that walketh at noonday"". As we have shown, the Italian is a born pot-hunter, and he has grown up in the fixed belief that killing song-birds for food is right! To him all is game that goes into the bag. The moment he sets foot in the open, he provides himself with a shot-gun, and he looks about for things to kill. It is ""a free country;"" therefore, he may kill anything he can find, cook it and eat it. If anybody attempts to check him,--sapristi! beware his gun! He cheerfully invades your fields, and even your lawn; and he shoots robins, bluebirds, thrushes, catbirds, grosbeaks, tanagers, orioles, woodpeckers, quail, snipe, ducks, crows, and herons. Down in Virginia, near Charlottesville, an Italian who was working on a new railroad once killed a turkey buzzard; and he selfishly cooked it and ate it, all alone. A pot-hunting compatriot of his heard of it, and reproached him for having-dined on game in camera. In the quarrel that ensued, one of the ""sportsmen"" stabbed the other to death. When the New York Zoological Society began work on its Park in 1899, the northern half of the Borough of the Bronx was a regular daily hunting-ground for the slaughter of song-birds, and all other birds that could be found. Every Sunday it was ""bangetty!"" ""bang!"" from Pelham Bay to Van Cortlandt. The police force paid not the slightest attention to these open, flagrant, shameless violations of the city ordinances and the state bird laws. In those days I never but once heard of a policeman _on his own initiative_ arresting a birdshooter, even on Sunday; but whenever meddlesome special wardens from the Zoological Park have pointedly called upon the local police force for help, it has always been given with cheerful alacrity. In the fall of 1912 an appeal to the Police Commissioner resulted in a general order to stop all hunting and shooting in the Borough of the Bronx, and a reform is now on. The war on the bird-killers in New York City began in 1900. It seemed that if the Zoological Society did not take up the matter, the slaughter would continue indefinitely. The white man's burden was taken up; and the story of the war is rather illuminating. Mr. G.O. Shields, President of the League of American Sportsmen, quickly became interested in the matter, and entered actively into the campaign. For months unnumbered, he spent every Sunday patroling the woods and thickets of northern New York and Westchester county, usually accompanied by John J. Rose and Rudolph Bell of the Zoological Park force, for whom appointments as deputy game wardens had been secured from the State. The adventures of that redoubtable trio of man-hunters would make an interesting chapter. They were shot at by poachers, but more frequently they shot at the other fellows. Just why it was that no one was killed, no one seems to know. Many Italians and several Americans were arrested while hunting, haled to court, prosecuted and fined. Finally, a reign of terror set in; and that was the beginning of the end. It became known that those three men could not be stopped by threats, and that they always got their man--unless he got into a human rabbit-warren of the Italian boarding-house species. That was the only escape that was possible. The largest haul of dead birds was 43 robins, orioles, thrushes and woodpeckers, captured along with the five Italians who committed the indiscretion of sitting down in the woods to divide their dead birds. We saved all the birds in alcohol, and showed them in court. The judge fined two of the Italians $50 each, and the other three were sent to the penitentiary for two months each. Even yet, however, at long intervals an occasional son of sunny Italy tries his luck at Sunday bird shooting; but if anyone yells at him to ""Halt!"" he throws away his gun and stampedes through the brush like a frightened deer. The birds of upper New York are now fairly secure; but it has taken ten years of fighting to bring it about. Throughout New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and even Minnesota, wherever there are large settlements of Italians and Hungarians, the reports are the same. They swarm through the country every Sunday, and shoot every wild thing they see. Wherever there are large construction works,--railroads, canals or aqueducts,--look for bird slaughter, and you are sure to find it. The exception to this rule, so far as I know, is along the line of the new Catskill aqueduct, coming to New York City. The contractors have elected not to permit bird slaughter, and the rule has been made that any man who goes out hunting will instantly be discharged. That is the best rule that ever was made for the protection of birds and game against gang-working aliens. Let every state and province in America look out sharply for the bird-killing foreigner; for sooner or later, he will surely attack your wild life. The Italians are spreading, spreading, spreading. If you are without them to-day, to-morrow they will be around you. Meet them at the threshold with drastic laws, throughly enforced; for no half way measures will answer. Pennsylvania has had the worst experience of alien slaughterers of any state, thus far. _Six_ of her game wardens have been _killed_, and eight or ten have been wounded, by shooting! Finally her legislature arose in wrath, and passed a law prohibiting the ownership or possession of guns of any kind by aliens. The law gives the right of domiciliary search, and it surely is enforced. Of course the foreign population ""kicked"" against the law, but the People's steam roller went over them just the same. In New York, we require from an alien a license costing $20, and it has saved a million (perhaps) of our birds; but the Pennsylvania law is the best. It may be taken as a model for every state and province in America. Its text is as follows: Section I. Be it enacted, &c., That from and after the passage of this act, it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born resident to hunt for or capture or kill, in this Commonwealth, any wild bird or animal, either game or otherwise, of any description, excepting in defense of person or property; and to that end it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born resident, within this Commonwealth, to either own or be possessed of a shotgun or rifle of any make. Each and every person violating any provision of this section shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a penalty of twenty-five dollars for each offense, or undergo imprisonment in the common jail of the county for the period of one day for each dollar of penalty imposed. Provided, That in addition to the before-named penalty, all guns of the before-mentioned kinds found in possession or under control of an unnaturalized foreign-born resident shall, upon conviction of such person, or upon his signing a declaration of guilt as prescribed by this act, be declared forfeited to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and shall be sold by the Board of Game Commissioners as hereinafter directed. Section 2. For the purpose of this act, any unnaturalized foreign-born person who shall reside or live within the boundaries of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for ten consecutive days shall be considered a resident and shall be liable to the penalties imposed for violation of the provisions of this act. Section 3. That the possession of a shotgun or rifle at any place outside of a building, within this Commonwealth, by an unnaturalized foreign-born resident, shall be conclusive proof of a violation of the provisions of section one of this act, and shall render any person convicted thereof liable to the penalty as fixed by said section. Section 4. That the presence of a shotgun or rifle in a room or house, or building or tent, or camp of any description, within this Commonwealth, occupied by or controlled by an unnaturalized foreign-born resident shall be prima facie evidence that such gun is owned or controlled by the person occupying or controlling the property in which such gun is found, and shall render such person liable to the penalty imposed by section one of this act. Other sections provide for the full enforcement of this law. It is now high time, and an imperative public necessity, that every state should act in this matter, before its bird life is suddenly attacked, and serious inroads made upon it. Do it NOW! The enemy is headed your way. Don't wait for him to strike the first blow! _Duty of the Italian Press and Clergy_.--Now what is the best remedy for the troubles that will arise for Italians in America because of wrong principles established in Italy? It is not in the law, the police, the court and the punishment. It is in _educating the Italian into a knowledge of the duties of the good citizen_! The Italian press and clergy can do this; and _no one else can do it so easily, so quickly and so well_! Those two powerful forces should enter seriously upon this task. In every other respect, the naturalized Italian tries to become a good citizen, and adjust himself to the laws and the customs of his new country. Why should he not do this in regard to bird life? It is not too much to ask, nor is it too much to _exact_. Does the Italian workman, or store-keeper who makes his living by honest toil _enjoy_ breaking our bird laws, _enjoy_ irritating and injuring those with whom he has come to live? Does he _enjoy_ being watched, and searched, and chased, and arrested,--all for a few small birds that he _does not need_ for food? He earns good wages; he has plenty of good food; and he must be _educated_ into protecting our birds instead of destroying them. The Italian newspapers and clergy have a serious duty to perform in this matter, and we hope they will diligently discharge it. [Illustration: DEAD SONG-BIRDS These jars contain the dead bodies of 43 valuable insectivorous birds that were taken from two Italians in October, 1905, in the suburbs of New York City, by game wardens of the New York Zoological Society.] * * * * * CHAPTER XII DESTRUCTION OF SONG BIRDS BY SOUTHERN NEGROES AND POOR WHITES Before going farther, there is one point that I wish to make quite clear. Whenever the people of a particular race make a specialty of some particular type of wrong-doing, anyone who pointedly rebukes the faulty members of that race is immediately accused of ""race prejudice."" On account of the facts I am now setting forth about the doings of Italian and negro bird-killers, I expect to be accused along that line. If I am, I shall strenuously deny the charge. The facts speak for themselves. Zoologically, however, I am strongly prejudiced against the people of any race, creed, club, state or nation who make a specialty of any particularly offensive type of bird or wild animal slaughter; and I do not care who knows it. The time was, and I remember it very well, when even the poorest gunner scorned to kill birds that were not considered ""game."" In days lang syne, many a zoological collector has been jeered because the specimens he had killed for preservation were not ""game."" But times have changed. In the wearing of furs, we have bumped down steps both high and steep. In 1880 American women wore sealskin, marten, otter, beaver and mink. To-day nothing that wears hair is too humble to be skinned and worn. To-day ""they are wearing"" skins of muskrats, foxes, rabbits, skunks, domestic cats, squirrels, and even rats. And see how the taste for game,--of some sections of our population,--also has gone down. In the North, the Italians are fighting for the privilege of eating everything that wears feathers; but we allow no birds to be shot for food save game birds and cranes. In the South, the negroes and poor whites are killing song-birds, woodpeckers and doves for food; and in several states some of it is done under the authority of the laws. Look at these awful lists: * * * * * IN THESE STATES, ROBINS ARE LEGALLY SHOT AND EATEN: Louisiana North Carolina Tennessee Texas Mississippi South Carolina Maryland Florida IN THESE STATES, BLACKBIRDS ARE LEGALLY SHOT AND EATEN: Louisiana Pennsylvania Tennessee District of Columbia South Carolina CRANES ARE SHOT AND EATEN IN THESE STATES: Colorado North Dakota Nevada Oklahoma Nebraska In Mississippi, the _cedar bird_ is legally shot and eaten! In North Carolina, the meadow lark is shot and eaten. IN THE FOLLOWING STATES, DOVES ARE CONSIDERED ""GAME,"" AND ARE SHOT IN AN ""OPEN SEASON:"" Alabama Georgia Minnesota Ohio Arkansas Idaho Mississippi Oregon California Illinois Missouri Pennsylvania Connecticut Kentucky Nebraska South Carolina Delaware Louisiana New Mexico Tennessee Dist. of Columbia Maryland North Carolina Texas Utah Virginia * * * * * The killing of doves represents a great and widespread decline in the ethics of sportsmanship. In the twenty-six States named, a great many men who _call_ themselves sportsmen indulge in the cheap and ignoble pastime of potting weak and confiding doves. It is on a par with the ""sport"" of hunting English sparrows in a city street. Of course this is, to a certain extent, a matter of taste; but there is at least one club of sportsmen into which no dove-killer can enter, provided his standard of ethics is known in advance. With the killing of robins, larks, blackbirds and cedar birds for food, the case is quite different. No white man calling himself a sportsman ever indulges in such low pastimes as the killing of such birds for food. That burden of disgrace rests upon the negroes and poor whites of the South; but at the same time, it is a shame that respectable white men sitting in state legislatures should deliberately enact laws _permitting_ such disgraceful practices, or permit such disgraceful and ungentlemanly laws to remain in force! Here is a case by way of illustration, copied very recently from the Atlanta _Journal_: Editor _Journal_:--I located a robin roost up the Trinity River, six miles from Dallas, and prevailed on six Dallas sportsmen to go with me on a torch-light bird hunt. This style of hunting was, of course, new to the Texans, but they finally consented to go, and I had the pleasure of showing them how it was done. Equipped with torch lights and shot guns, we proceeded. After reaching the hunting grounds the sport began in reality, and continued for two hours and ten minutes, with a total slaughter of 10,157 birds, an average of 1,451 birds killed by each man. But the Texans give me credit for killing at least 2,000 of the entire number. I was called 'the king of bird hunters' by the sportsmen of Dallas, Texas, and have been invited to command-in-chief the next party of hunters which go from Dallas to the Indian Territory in search of large game.--F.L. CROW, Dallas, Texas, former Atlantan. Dallas, Texas, papers and Oklahoma papers, please copy! As a further illustration of the spirit manifested in the South toward robins, I quote the following story from Dr. P.P. Claxton, of the University of Tennessee, as related in Audubon Educational Leaflet No. 46, by Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson:-- ""The roost to which I refer,"" says Professor Claxton, ""was situated in what is locally known as a 'cedar glade,' near Porestville, Bedford Co., Tennessee. This is a great cedar country, and robins used to come in immense numbers during the winter months, to feed on the berries. [Illustration: THE ROBIN OF THE NORTH Our best-beloved Song Bird, now being legally shot as ""game"" in the South. In the North there is now only one robin for every ten formerly there.] ""The spot which the roost occupied was not unlike numerous others that might have been selected. The trees grew to a height of from five to thirty feet, and for a mile square were literally loaded at night with robins. Hunting them while they roosted was a favorite sport. A man would climb a cedar tree with a torch, while his companions with poles and clubs would disturb the sleeping birds on the adjacent trees. Blinded by the light, the suddenly awakened birds flew to the torch-bearer; who, _as he seized each bird would quickly pull off its head_, and drop it into a sack suspended from his shoulders. [Illustration: THE MOCKING-BIRD OF THE SOUTH This sweet singer of the South is NOT being shot in the North for food! No northern lawmaker ever will permit such barbarity.] ""The capture of three of four hundred birds was an ordinary night's work. Men and boys would come in wagons from all the adjoining counties and camp near the roost for the purpose of killing robins. Many times, 100 or more hunters with torches and clubs would be at work in a single night. _For three years_ this tremendous slaughter continued in winter,--and then the survivors deserted the roost."" [Illustration: NORTHERN ROBINS READY FOR SOUTHERN SLAUGHTER 195 Birds at Avery Island, La. in January 1912, Photographed Daring the Annual Slaughter, by E.A. McIlhenny] No: these people were not Apache Indians, led by a Geronimo who knew no mercy, no compassion. We imagine that they were mostly poor white trash, of Tennessee. One small hamlet sent to market annually enough dead robins to return $500 at _five cents per dozen_; which means _120,000 birds_! Last winter Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny of Avery Island, La. (south of New Iberia) informed me that every winter, during the two weeks that the holly berries are ripe thousands of robins come to his vicinity to feed upon them. ""Then every negro man and boy who can raise a gun is after them. About 10,000 robins are slaughtered each day while they remain. Their dead bodies are sold in New Iberia at 10 cents each."" The accompanying illustrations taken by Mr. McIlhenny shows 195 robins on one tree, and explains how such great slaughter is possible. An officer of the Louisiana Audubon Society states that a conservative estimate of the number of robins annually killed in Louisiana for food purposes when they are usually plentiful, is a _quarter of a million_! The food of the robin is as follows: Insects, 40 per cent; wild fruit, 43 per cent; cultivated fruit, 8 per cent, miscellaneous vegetable food, 5 per cent. SPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.--In 1912 a female colored servant who recently had arrived from country life in Virginia chanced to remark to me at our country home in the middle of August: ""I wish I could find some birds' nests!"" ""What for?"" I asked, rather puzzled. ""Why, to get the aigs and _eat 'em!_"" she responded with a bright smile and flashing teeth. ""Do you eat the eggs of _wild_ birds?"" ""Yes indeed! It's _fine_ to get a pattridge nest! From them we nearly always git a whole dozen of aigs at once,--back where I live, in Virginia."" ""Do the colored people of Virginia make a _practice_ of hunting for the eggs of wild birds, and eating them?"" ""Yes, indeed we do. In the spring and summer, when the birds are around, we used to get out every Sunday, and hunt all day. Some days we'd come back with a whole bucket full of aigs; and then we'd set up half the night, cookin' and eatin' 'em. They was _awful_ good!"" Her face fairly beamed at the memory of it. A few days later, this story of the doings of Virginia negroes was fully corroborated by a colored man who came from another section of that state. Three months later, after special inquiries made at my request, a gentleman of Richmond obtained further corroboration, from negroes. He was himself much surprised by the state of fact that was revealed to him. In the North, the economic value of our song birds and other destroyers of insects and weed seeds is understood by a majority of the people, and as far as possible those birds are protected from all human enemies. But in the South, a new division of the Army of Destruction has risen into deadly prominence. In _Recreation_ Magazine for May, 1909, Mr. Charles Askins published a most startling and illuminating article, entitled ""The South's Problem in Game Protection."" It brought together in concrete form and with eye-witness reliability the impressions that for months previous had been gaining ground in the North. In order to give the testimony of a man who has seen what he describes, I shall now give numerous quotations from Mr. Askins' article, which certainly bears the stamp of truthfulness, without any ""race prejudice"" whatever. It is a calm, judicial, unemotional analysis of a very bad situation: and I particularly commend it alike to the farmers of the North and all the true sportsmen of the South. In his opening paragraphs Mr. Askins describes game and hunting conditions in the South as they were down to twenty years ago, when the negroes were too poor to own guns, and shooting was not for them. * * * * * SPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES. It is all different now, says Mr. Askins, and the old days will only come back with the water that has gone down the stream. The master is with his fathers or he is whiling away his last days on the courthouse steps of the town. Perhaps a chimney or two remain of what was once the ""big house"" on the hill; possibly it is still standing, but as forlorn and lifeless as a dead tree. The muscadine grapes still grow in the swale and the persimmons in the pasture field, but neither 'possum nor 'coon is left to eat them. The last deer vanished years ago, the rabbits died in their baby coats and the quail were killed in June. Old ""Uncle Ike"" has gone across the ""Great River"" with his master, and his grandson glances at you askance, nods sullenly, whistles to his half breed bird dog, shoulders his three dollar gun and leaves you. He is typical of the change and has caused it, this grandson of dear old Uncle Ike. In the same way the white man is telling the black to abide upon the plantation raising cotton and corn, and further than this nothing will be required of him. He can cheat a white man or a black, steal in a petty way anything that comes handy, live in marriage or out of it to please himself, kill another negro if he likes, and lastly shoot every wild thing that can be eaten, if only he raises the cotton and the corn. But the white sportsmen of the South have never willingly granted the shooting privilege in its entirety, and hence this story. They have told him to trap the rabbits, pot the robins, slaughter the doves, kill the song birds, but to spare the white sportsman's game, the aristocratic little bobwhite quail. In the beginning not so much damage to southern game interests could be accomplished by our colored man and brother, however decided his inclinations. He had no money, no ammunition and no gun. His weapons were an ax, a club, a trap, and a hound dog; possibly he might own an old war musket bored out for shot. Such an outfit was not adapted to quail shooting and especially to wing shooting, with which knowledge Dixie's sportsmen were content. Let the negro ramble about with his hound dog and his war musket; he couldn't possibly kill the quail. And so Uncle Ike's grandson loafed and pottered about in the fields with his ax and his hound dogs, not doing so much harm to the quail but acquiring knowledge of the habits of the birds and skill as a still-hunting pot-hunter that would serve him well later on. The negro belongs to a primitive race of people and all such races have keener eyes than white men whose fathers have pored over lines of black and white. He learned to see the rabbit in its form, the squirrels in the leafy trees, and the quails huddled in the grass. The least shade of gray in the shadow of the creek bank he distinguished at once as a rabbit, a glinting flash from a tree top he knew instantly as being caused by the slight movement of a hidden squirrel, and the quiver of a single stem of sedge grass told him of a bevy of birds hiding in the depths. The pot-hunting negro has all the skill of the Indian, has more industry in his loafing, and kills without pity and without restraint. This grandson of Uncle Ike was growing sulky, too, with the knowledge that the white man was bribing him with half a loaf to raise cotton and corn when he might as well exact it all. And this he shortly did, as we shall see. The time came when cotton went up to sixteen cents a pound and single breech-loading guns went down to five dollars apiece. The negro had money now, and the merchants--these men who had said let the nigger alone so long as he raises cotton and corn--sold him the guns, a gun for every black idler, man and boy, in all the South. Then shortly a wail went up from the sportsmen, ""The niggers are killing our quail."" They not only were killing them, but most of the birds were already dead. On the grounds of the Southern Field Club where sixty bevies were raised by the dogs in one day, within two years but three bevies could be found in a day by the hardest kind of hunting; and this story was repeated all over the South. Now the negro began to raise bird dogs in place of hounds, and he carried his new gun to church if services happened to be held on a week day. Finally the negro had grown up and had compassed his ambition: he could shoot partridges flying just the same as a white man, was a white man except for a trifling difference in color; and he could kill more birds, too, three times as many. It was merely a change from the old order to the new in which a dark-skinned ""sportsman"" had taken the place in plantation life of the dear old ""Colonel"" of loved memory. The negro had exacted his price for raising cotton and corn. [Illustration: THE SOUTHERN-NEGRO METHOD OF COMBING OUT THE WILD LIFE ""Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so in the matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone, and pot a bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or when he has a sale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for fun he wants to be with the 'gang'.""--Charles Askins. Reproduced from Recreation Magazine. By permission of the Outdoor World.] Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so in the matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone and pot a bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or when he has a sale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for fun he wants to be with the ""gang."" I have seen the darkies at Christmas time collect fifty in a drove with every man his dog, and spread out over the fields. Such a glorious time as he has then! A single cottontail will draw a half-dozen shots and perhaps a couple of young bucks will pour loads into a bunny after he is dead out of pure deviltry and high spirits. I once witnessed the accidental killing of a young negro on this kind of a foray. His companions loaded him into a wagon, stuck a cigar in his mouth, and tried to pour whiskey down him every time they took a drink themselves as they rode back to town. This army of black hunters and their dogs cross field after field, combing the country with fine teeth that leave neither wild animal nor bird life behind. There comes a time toward the spring of the year after the quail season is over when the average rural darky is ""between hay and grass."" The merchants on whom he has depended for supplies make it a practice to refuse credit between January first and crop time. The black has spent his cotton money, his sweet potato pile has vanished, the sorghum barrel is empty, he has eaten the last of his winter's pork, and all that remains is a bit of meal and the meat his gun can secure. He is hunting in grim earnest now, using all the cunning and skill acquired by years of practice. He eats woodpeckers, jaybirds, hawks and skunks, drawing the line only at crows and buzzards. At this season of the year I have carried chicken hawks up to the cabins for the sake of watching the delight of the piccaninnies who with glowing eyes would declare, ""Them's mos' as good as chicken."" What happens to the robins, doves, larks, red birds, mocking birds and all songsters in this hungry season needs hardly to be stated. It is also a time between hay and grass for the rabbits and the quail. The corn fields are bare and the weed seeds are exhausted. A spring cold spell pinches, they lose their vitality, become thin and quite lack their ordinary wariness. Then the figure-four trap springs up in the hedgerow and the sedge while the work of decimation goes more rapidly along. The rabbits can no longer escape the half-starved dogs, the thinning cover fails to hide the quail and the song birds betray themselves by singing of the coming spring. With the growing scarcity of the game now comes the season of sedge and field burning. This is done ostensibly to prepare the land for spring plowing, but really to destroy the last refuge of the quail and rabbits so that they can be bagged with certainty. All the negroes of a neighborhood collect for one of these burnings, all their dogs, and of course all the boys from six years old up. They surround the field and set it on fire in many places, leaving small openings for the game to dash out among the motley assembly. I have seen quail fly out of the burning grass with flaming particles still attached to them. They alight on the burnt ground too bewildered to fly again and the boys and dogs pick them up. Crazed rabbits try the gauntlet amidst the barking curs, shouting negroes and popping guns, but death is sure and quick. The few quail that may escape have no refuge from the hawks and nothing to eat, so every battue of this kind marks the absolute end of the birds in one vicinity; and the next day the darkies repeat the performance elsewhere. At this season of the year, the first of May, the blacks are putting in some of their one hundred working days while the single breech-loader rusts in the chimney corner. Surely the few birds that have escaped the foray of the ""gang,"" lived through the hungry days, and survived their burned homes can now call ""Bob White"" and mate in peace. But school is out and the summer sun is putting new life into the bare feet of the half-grown boys, and the halfbreed bird dogs are busier than they were even in winter. The young rabbits are killed before they get out of the nest, and the quail eggs must be hidden rarely well that escape both the eyes of the boys and the noses of the dogs. After all it is not surprising that but three bevies remained of the sixty. Doubtless they would not, except that nature is very kind to her own in the sunny South. Not every white man in the South is a sportsman or even a shooter; many are purely business men who have said let the ""nigger"" do as he likes so long as he raises cotton and buys our goods. But Dixie has her full share of true men of the out-of-doors and they have sworn in downright Southern fashion that this thing has got to end. Nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzling. In Alabama they made an effort and a beginning. They asked for a law requiring every man to obtain written permission before entering the lands of another to hunt and shoot; they asked for a resident license law taxing every gun not less than five dollars a year; for a shortened season, a bag limit, and a complete system of State wardens. Unfortunately, a lot of white farmers were in the same range as the blacks, and being hit, too, they raised a great outcry. The result was that the Alabama sportsmen got everything they asked for except the foundation of the structure they were trying to build, the high resident license or gun tax which alone could have shut out three dollar guns and saved the remnant of the game. Under the new law the sale of game was forbidden, neither could it be shipped out of the State alive or dead; the ever popular non-resident license was provided for; the season was shortened and the bag limited; the office of State game warden was created with deputies to be paid from fines; hunting upon the lands of another without written permission became a misdemeanor; and then the whole thing was nullified by reducing the resident license to nothing where a man shot upon his own land, one dollar in his own county, and two dollars outside of it. In its practical workings the new law amounts to this: A few northern gunners have paid the non-resident license fee, and enough resident licenses have been taken out by the city sportsmen to make up the handsome salary of the State warden. The negro still hunts upon his own land _or upon the land of the man who wants corn and cotton raised_, with perfect indifference to the whole thing. Who was to enforce the law against him? Not the one disgusted deputy with three big counties to patrol who depended for his salary upon the fines collected from the negroes. It would take one man to every three miles square to protect the game in the South. The one effective way of dealing with the situation in Alabama was to have legislated three dollar guns out of existence with a five dollar tax, adding to this nearly a like amount on dogs. Hardly a sportsman in the South will disagree with this conclusion. But sportsmen never had a majority vote either in the South or in the North, and the South's grave problem is yet unsolved. I do not favor depriving the black man of his natural human right to hunt and shoot. If he is the owner of land, or if he leases or rents it, or if he does not, he should have exactly the same privilege of hunting that the white man has. That is not the question now, however, but how to restrict him to legal shooting, to make him amenable to the law that governs the white man, to deprive him of the absolute license he now enjoys to kill throughout the year without mercy, without discrimination, without restraint. If only for selfish reasons, we of the North should reach to southern sportsmen a helping hand, for by and by the last of our migratory song birds will go down into Dixie and never return. * * * * * Mr. Askins has fairly stated a profoundly disturbing case. The remedy must contain at least three ingredients. The sportsmen of the South must stop the unjustifiable slaughter of their non-migratory game birds. As a matter of comity between states, the gentlemen of the South must pass laws to stop the killing of northern song-birds and all crop-protecting birds, for food. Finally, all men, North and South, East and West, must unite in the work that is necessary to secure the immediate enactment by Congress of a law for the federal protection of all migratory birds. * * * * * CHAPTER XIII EXTERMINATION OF BIRDS FOR WOMEN'S HATS[D] [Footnote D: In the preparation of this chapter and its illustrations, I have had much valuable assistance from Mr. C. William Beebe, who recently has probed the London feather trade almost to the bottom.] It is high time for the whole civilized world to know that many of the most beautiful and remarkable birds of the world are now being _exterminated_ to furnish millinery ornaments for women's wear. The mass of new information that we have recently secured on this traffic from the headquarters of the feather trade is appalling. Previously, I had not dreamed that conditions are half as bad as they are. It is entirely fitting that on this subject New York should send a message to London. New York is almost a Spotless Town in plume-free millinery, and London and Paris are the worst places in the world. We have cleaned house. With but extremely slight exceptions, the blood of the slaughtered innocents is no longer upon our skirts, and on the subject of plumage millinery we have a right to be just as Pharisaical as we choose. Here in New York (and also in New Jersey) no man may sell, own for sale or offer for sale the plumage of any wild American bird other than a game bird. More than that, the plumage of no foreign bird belonging to any bird family represented in the fauna of North America can be sold here! There are only a few kinds of improper ""millinery"" feathers that it is possible to sell here under the law. Thanks to the long and arduous campaign of the National Association of Audubon Societies, founded and for ten years directed by gallant William Dutcher, you now see on the streets of New York very, very little wild-bird plumage save that from game birds. It is true that a few servant girls are now wearing the cast-off aigrettes of their mistresses; but they are only as one in a thousand. At Atlantic City there is said to be a fine display of servant-girl and ladies-maid aigrettes. In New York and New Jersey, in Pennsylvania for everything save the sale of heron and egret plumes (a privilege obtained by a bunko game), in Massachusetts, and in many other of our States, the wild-birds'-plumage millinery business is dead. Two years ago, when the New York legislature refused to repeal the Dutcher law, the Millinery Association asserted, and brought a cloud of witnesses to Albany to prove, that the enforcement of the law would throw thousands of operatives out of employment. [Illustration: BEAUTIFUL AND CURIOUS BIRDS NOW BEING DESTROYED FOR THE FEATHER TRADE--(I) Belted Kingfisher Victoria Crowned Pigeon Superb Calliste Greater Bird of Paradise Common Tern Cock of the Rock] The law is in effect; and the aigrette business is dead in this state. Have any operatives starved, or been thrown out of employment? We have heard of none. They are now at work making very pretty hat ornaments of silk and ribbons, and gauze and lace; and ""_They_ are wearing them."" [Illustration: 1600 HUMMINGBIRD SKINS AT 2 CENTS EACH! Part of Lot Purchased by the Zoological Society at the Regular Quarterly London Millinery Feather Sale, August, 1912.] But even while these words are being written, there is one large fly in the ointment. The store-window of E. &. S. Meyers, 688 Broadway, New York, contains about _six hundred plumes and skins of birds of paradise for sale for millinery purposes_. No wonder the great bird of paradise is now almost extinct! Their sale here is possible because the Dutcher law protects from the feather dealers only the birds that belong to avian families represented in the United States. With fiendish cunning and enterprise, the shameless feather dealers are ferreting out the birds whose skins and plumes may legally be imported into this country and sold; but we will meet that with a law that will protect all foreign birds, so far as we are concerned. Now it is time for the universal enactment of a law which will prohibit the sale and use as ornaments of the plumage, feathers or skins of _any_ wild bird that is not a legitimate game bird. London is now the head of the giant octopus of the ""feather trade"" that has reached out its deadly tentacles into the most remote wildernesses of the earth, and steadily is drawing in the ""skins"" and ""plumes"" and ""quills"" of the most beautiful and most interesting _unprotected_ birds of the world. The extent of this cold-blooded industry, supported by vain and hard-hearted women, will presently be shown in detail. Paris is the great manufacturing center of feather trimming and ornaments, and the French people obstinately refuse to protect the birds from extermination, because their slaughter affords employment to a certain numbers of French factory operatives. All over the world where they have real estate possessions, the men of England know how to protect game from extermination. The English are good at protecting game--when they decide to set about it. Why should London be the Mecca of the feather-killers of the world? It is easily explained: (1) London has the greatest feather market in the world; (2) the feather industry ""wants the money""; and (3) the London feather industry is willing to spend money in fighting to retain its strangle-hold on the unprotected birds of the world. Let us run through a small portion of the mass of fresh evidence before us. It will be easier for the friends of birds to read these details here than to procure them at first hand, as we have done. The first thing that strikes one is the fact that the feather-hunters are scattered _all over the world where bird life is plentiful_ and there are no laws to hinder their work. I commend to every friend of birds this list of the species whose plumage is to-day being bought and sold in large quantities every year in London. To the birds of the world this list is of deadly import, for it spells extermination. The reader will notice that it is the way of the millinery octopus to reach out to the uttermost ends of the earth, and take everything that it can use. From the trackless jungles of New Guinea, round the world both ways to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, no unprotected bird is safe. The humming-birds of Brazil, the egrets of the world at large, the rare birds of paradise, the toucan, the eagle, the condor and the emu, all are being _exterminated_ to swell the annual profits of the millinery trade. The case is _far_ more serious than the world at large knows, or even suspects. But for the profits, the birds would be safe; and no unprotected wild species can long escape the hounds of Commerce. But behold the list of rare, curious and beautiful birds that are today in grave peril: [Illustration: BEAUTIFUL AND CURIOUS BIRDS NOW BEING DESTROYED FOR THE FEATHER TRADE--(II) Lyre Bird White Ibis Golden Eagle Resplendent Trogan Silver Pheasant Toco Toucan] * * * * * LIST OF BIRDS NOW BEING EXTERMINATED FOR THE LONDON AND CONTINENTAL FEATHER MARKETS: _Species_. _Locality._ American Egret Venezuela, S.

As one item, let us take the sales in London in February, May and October, 1911, because they bring the subject well down to date. My agent's explanatory note is as follows: ""These three sales represent six months. Very nearly double this quantity is sold by these four firms in a year. We must also take into consideration that all the feathers are not brought to the London market, and that _very large shipments are also made direct to the raw-feather dealers and manufacturers of Paris and Berlin, and that Amsterdam also gets large quantities from the West Indies_. For your purpose, I report upon three sales, at different periods of the year 1911, and as those sales do not vary much, you will be able to judge the consumption of birds in a year."" The ""aigrettes"" of the feather trade come from egrets, and, being very light, it requires the death of several birds to yield one ounce. In many catalogues, the word ""albatross"" stands for the jabiru, a nearly-exterminated species of giant stork, inhabiting South America. ""Rhea"" often stands for vulture plumage. If the feather dealers had deliberately attempted to form an educational list of the most beautiful and the most interesting birds of the world, they could hardly have done better than they have done in the above list. If it were in my power to show the reader a colored plate of each species now being exterminated by the feather trade, he would be startled by the exhibit. That the very choicest birds of the whole avian world should be thus blotted out at the behest of vain and heartless women is a shame, a disgrace and world-wide loss. * * * * * LONDON FEATHER SALE OF FEBRUARY, 1911 _Sold by Hale & Sons Sold by Dalton & Young_ Aigrettes 3,069 ounces Aigrettes 1,606 ounces Herons 960 "" Herons 250 "" Birds of Paradise 1,920 skins Paradise 4,330 bodies _Sold by Figgis & Co.

The defenders of the feather trade are at great pains to assure the world that in the monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly sales, feathers often appear in the market twice in the same year; and this statement is made for them in order to be absolutely fair. Recent examinations of the plume catalogues for an entire year, marked with the price _paid_ for each item, reveals very few which are blank, indicating no sale! The subtractions of the duplicated items would alter the result only very slightly. The full extent of England's annual consumption of the plumage of wild birds slaughtered especially for the trade never has been determined. I doubt whether it is possible to ascertain it. The information that we have is so fragmentary that in all probability it reflects only a small portion of the whole truth, but for all that, it is sufficient to prove the case of the Defenders of the Birds _vs_. the London Chamber of Commerce.

The statement published above comes to me direct, from an absolutely competent and reliable source. [Footnote F: ""The Feather Trade,"" by C.F. Downham, p. 63-4.] Undoubtedly the friends of birds, and likewise their enemies, will be interested in the prices at which the skins of the most beautiful birds of the world are sold in London, prior to their annihilation by the feather industry. I submit the following exhibit, copied from the circular of Messrs. Lewis & Peat.

It will be noticed that the breast of the grebe has almost wholly disappeared from the feather market and from women's hats. The reason is that there are no longer enough birds of that group to hold a place in the London market! Few indeed are the Americans who know that from 1900 to 1908 the lake region of southern Oregon was the scene of the slaughter of uncountable thousands of those birds, which continued until the grebes were almost exterminated. When the wonderful lyre-bird of Australia had been almost exterminated for its tail feathers, its open slaughter was stopped by law, and a heavy fine was imposed on exportation, amounting, I have been told, to $250 for each offense. My latest news of the lyre-bird was of the surreptitious exportation of 200 skins to the London feather market. In India, the smuggling outward of the skins of protected birds is constantly going on. Occasionally an exporter is caught and fined; but that does not stop the traffic. Bird-lovers must now bid farewell forever to all the birds of paradise. Nothing but the legal closing of the world's markets against their plumes and skins can save any of them. They never were numerous; nor does any species range over a wide area. They are strictly insular, and the island homes of some of them are very small. Take the great bird of paradise (_Paradisea apoda_) as an illustration. On Oct. 2, 1912, at Indianapolis, Indiana, a city near the center of the United States, in three show-windows within 100 feet of the headquarters of the Fourth National Conservation Congress, I counted 11 stuffed heads and 11 complete sets of plumes of this bird, displayed for sale. The prices ranged from $30 to $47.50 each! And while I looked, a large lady approached, pointed her finger at the remains of a greater bird of paradise, and with grim determination, said to her shopping companion: ""There! I want one o' them, an' I'm agoin' to _have_ it, too!"" Says Mr. James Buckland in ""Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill"": ""Mr. Goodfellow has returned within the last few weeks from a second expedition to new Guinea.... One can now walk, he states, miles and miles through the former haunts of these birds [of paradise] without seeing or hearing even the commonest species. When I reflect on this sacrilege, I am lost in wonder at the apathy of the British public."" Mr. Carl Hagenbeck wrote me only three months ago that ""the condors of the Andes are all being exterminated for their feathers, and these birds are now very difficult to obtain."" The egret and heron plumes, known under the trade name of ""osprey, etc., feathers,"" form by far the most important item in each feather sale. There are _fifteen_ grades! They are sold by the ounce, and the prices range all the way from twenty-eight cents per ounce for ""mixed heron"" to _two hundred and twenty-five shillings_ ($45.60) per ounce for the best Brazilian ""short selected,"" on February 7, 1912! Is it any wonder that in Philadelphia the prices of finished aigrettes, ready to be worn, runs from $20 to $125! The plumes that run up into the big figures are the ""short selected"" coming from the following localities, and quoted at the prices set down here in shillings and pence. Count the shilling at twenty-four cents, United States money. PRICES OF ""SHORT SELECTED"" EGRET AND HERON PLUMES, IN LONDON ON FEBRUARY 7, 1912 (Lewis & Peat's List) East Indies per ounce, 117/6 to 207/6 = $49.80 max. Rangoon "" "" 150/0 "" 192/6 = 46.20 "" China "" "" 130/0 "" 245/0 = 58.80 "" Brazil "" "" 200/0 "" 225/0 = 54.00 "" Venezuela "" "" 165/0 "" 222/6 = 53.40 "" The total offering of these ""short selected"" plumes in December 1911, was 689 ounces, and in February, 1912, it was 230 ounces. Now with these enormous prices prevailing, is it any wonder that the egrets and herons are being relentlessly pursued to the uttermost ends of the earth? I think that any man who really knows the habits of egrets and herons, and the total impossibility of any quantity of their shed feathers being picked up in a marketable state, must know in his heart that if the London and continental feather markets keep open a few years longer, _every species_ that furnishes ""short selected"" plumes will be utterly exterminated from off the face of the earth. Let the English people make no mistake about this, nor be fooled by any fairy tales of the feather trade about Venezuelan ""garceros,"" and vast quantities of valuable plumes picked off the bushes and out of the mud. Those carefully concocted egret-farm stories make lovely reading, but the reader who examines the evidence will soon decide the extent of their truthfulness. I think that they contain not even ten per cent of truth; and I shall not rest until the stories of Leon Laglaize and Mayeul Grisol have been put to the test in the regions where they originated. A _few_ plumes may be picked out of the jungle, yes; but as for any _commercial quantity_, it is at present beyond belief. Besides, we have direct, eye-witness testimony to the contrary. It must not be inferred that the friends of birds in England have been idle or silent in the presence of the London feather trade. On the contrary, the Royal Society for the Protection of Wild Birds and Mr. James Buckland have so strongly attacked the feather industry that the London Chamber of Commerce has felt called upon to come to its rescue. Mr. Buckland, on his own individual account, has done yeoman service to the cause, and his devotion to the birds, and his tireless energy, are both almost beyond the reach of praise in words. At the last moment before going to press I learn that the birds'-plumage bill has achieved the triumph of a ""first reading"" in Parliament, which looks as if success is at last in sight. The powerful pamphlet that he has written, published and circulated at his own expense, entitled ""Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill,"" is a splendid effort. What a pity it is that more individuals are not similarly inspired to make independent effort in the protection cause! But, strange to say, few indeed are the men who have either the nerve or the ability to ""go it alone."" On the introduction in Parliament of the bill to save the birds from the feather trade, it was opposed (through the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce), on the ground that if any bill against the sale of plumes should pass, and plumes could not be sold, the London business in wild-bird skins and feathers ""would immediately be transferred to the continent!"" In the face of that devastating and altogether horrible prospect, and because the London feather dealers ""need the money,"" the bill was at first defeated--to the great joy of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Downham; but the cause of birds will win in the end, because it is Right. The feather dealers have been shrewdly active in the defense of their trade, and the methods they have employed for influencing public opinion have quite outshone those put forth by their brethren in America. I have before me a copy of a booklet bearing the name of Mr. C.F. Downham as the author, and the London Chamber of Commerce has loaned its good name as publisher. Altogether it is a very shrewd piece of work, even though its arguments in justification of bird slaughter for the feather market are too absurd and weak for serious consideration. The chief burden of the defender of bird slaughter for millinery purposes is on account of the destruction of egrets and herons, but particularly the former. To offset as far as possible the absolutely true charge that egrets bear their best plumes in their breeding season, when the helpless young are in the nest and the parent birds must be killed to obtain the plumes, the feather trade has obtained from three Frenchmen--Leon Laglaize, Mayeul Grisol, and F. Geay--a beautiful and plausible story to the effect that in Venezuela the enormous output of egret plumes has been obtained _by picking up, off the bushes and out of the water and mud, the shed feathers of those birds!_ According to the story, Venezuela is full of _egret farms_, called ""garceros,""--where the birds breed and moult under strict supervision, and kindly drop their feathers in such places that it is possible _to find them_, and to _pick them up_, in a high state of preservation! And we are asked to believe that it is these very Venezuelan picked-up feathers that command in London the high price of _$44 per ounce_. [Illustration: THE FIGHT IN ENGLAND AGAINST THE USE OF WILD BIRD'S PLUMAGE IN THE MILLINERY TRADE Sandwich-men Employed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, that Patroled London Streets in July, 1911.] Mr. Laglaize is especially exploited by Mr. Downham, as a French traveler of high standing, and well known in the zoological museums of France; but, sad to say, when Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn cabled to the Museum of Natural History in Paris, inquiring about Mr. Laglaize, the cable flashed back the one sad word; ""_Inconnu!_"" (Unknown!) I think it entirely possible that enough shed feathers have been picked up in the reeking swamps of Venezuela, on the upper tributaries of the Orinoco, to afford _an excuse_ for the beautiful story of Mr. Laglaize. Any shrewd individual with money, and the influence that money secures, could put up just such a ""plant"" as I firmly believe _has_ been put up by some one in Venezuela. I will guarantee that I could accomplish such a job in Venezuela or Brazil, in four months' time, at an expense not exceeding one thousand dollars. That the great supply of immaculately perfect egret plumes that annually come out of Venezuela could by any possibility be picked up in the swamps where they were shed and dropped by the egrets, is entirely preposterous and incredible. The whole proportion is denounced by several men of standing and experience, none of whom are ""_inconnu_."" As a sweeping refutation of the fantastic statements regarding ""garceros,"" published by Mr. Downham as coming from Messrs. Laglaize, Grisol and Geay, I offer the written testimony of an American gentleman who at this moment owns and maintains within a few yards of his residence a large preserve of snowy egrets and herons, the former representing the species which furnishes egret plumes exactly similar to those shipped from Venezuela and Brazil. If the testimony of Mr. McIlhenny is not sufficient to stamp the statements of the three Frenchmen quoted by Mr. Downham as absolute and thoroughly misleading falsehoods, then there is no such thing in this world as evidence. I suggest a perusal of the statements of the three Frenchmen who are quoted with such confidence by Mr. Downham and published by the Hon. Chamber of Commerce at London, and then a careful reading of the following letter: Avery Island, La., June 17, 1912. DEAR MR. HORNADAY:-- I have before me your letter of June 8th, asking for information as to whether or no egrets shed their plumes at their nesting places in sufficient quantities to enable them to be gathered commercially. I most emphatically wish to state that it is impossible to gather at the nesting places of these birds any quantity of their plumes. I have nesting within 50 yards of where I am now sitting dictating this letter not less than 20,000 pairs of the various species of herons and egrets, and there are fully 2,500 pairs of snowy herons nesting within my preserve. During the nesting season, which covers the months of April, May and June, I am through this heronry in a small canoe almost every day, and often twice a day. I have had these herons under my close inspection for the past 17 years, and I have not in any one season picked up or seen more than half a dozen discarded plumes. Such plumes as I have picked up, I have kept on my desk, and given to the people who were interested. I remember that last year I picked up four plumes of the snowy heron that were in one bunch. I think these must have been plucked out by the birds fighting. This year I have found only one plume so far. I enclose it herewith. You will notice that it is one of the shorter plumes, and is badly worn at the end, as have been all the plumes which I have picked up in my heronry. I am positive that it is not possible for natural shed plumes to be gathered commercially. I have a number of times talked with plume hunters from Venezuela and other South American countries, and I have never heard of any egret feathers being gathered by their being picked up after the birds have shed them. I have heard of a number of heronries in South America that are protected by the land owners for the purpose of gathering a yearly crop of egret plumes, but this crop is gathered always by shooting a certain percentage of the birds. This shooting is done by experts with 22-calibre rifles, and does not materially disturb the nesting colony. I have known of two men who have been engaged in killing the birds on large estates in South America, who were paid regular salaries for their services as egret hunters. Very truly yours, E.A. McIlhenny. I am more than willing to set the above against the fairy tale of Mr. Laglaize. Here is the testimony of A.H. Meyer, an ex-plume-hunter, who for nine years worked in Venezuela. His sworn testimony was laid before the Legislature of the State of New York, in 1911, when the New York Milliners' Association was frantically endeavoring to secure the repeal of the splendid Dutcher law. This witness was produced by the National Association of Audubon Societies. ""My attention has been called to the fact that certain commercial interests in this city are circulating stories in the newspapers and elsewhere to the effect that the aigrettes used in the millinery trade come chiefly from Venezuela, where they are gathered from the ground in the large _garceros_, or breeding-colonies, of white herons. ""I wish to state that I have personally engaged in the work of collecting the plumes of these birds in Venezuela. This was my business for the years 1896 to 1905, inclusive. I am thoroughly conversant with the methods employed in gathering egret and snowy heron plumes in Venezuela, and I wish to give the following statement regarding the practices employed in procuring these feathers: ""The birds gather in large colonies to rear their young. They have the plumes only during the mating and nesting season. After the period when they are employed in caring for their young, it is found that the plumes are virtually of no commercial value, because of the worn and frayed condition to which they have been reduced. It is the custom in Venezuela to shoot the birds while the young are in the nests. A few feathers of the large white heron (American egret), known as the _Garza blanca_, can be picked up of a morning about their breeding places, but these are of small value and are known as ""dead feathers."" They are worth locally not over three dollars an ounce; while the feathers taken from the bird, known as ""live feathers,"" are worth fifteen dollars an ounce. ""My work led me into every part of Venezuela and Colombia where these birds are to be found, and I have never yet found or heard of any _garceros_ that were guarded for the purpose of simply gathering the feathers from the ground. No such condition exists in Venezuela. The story is absolutely without foundation, in my opinion, and has simply been put forward for commercial purposes. ""The natives of the country, who do virtually all of the hunting for feathers, are not provident in their nature, and their practices are of a most cruel and brutal nature. I have seen them frequently pull the plumes from wounded birds, leaving the crippled birds to die of starvation, unable to respond to the cries of their young in the nests above, which were calling for food. _I have known these people to tie and prop up wounded egrets on the marsh where they would attract the attention of other birds flying by. These decoys they keep in this position until they die of their wounds, or from the attacks of insects. I have seen the terrible red ants of that country actually eating out the eyes of these wounded, helpless birds that were tied up by the plume-hunters._ I could write you many pages of the horrors practiced in gathering aigrette feathers in Venezuela by the natives for the millinery trade of Paris and New York. ""To illustrate the comparatively small number of dead feathers which are collected, I will mention that in one year I and my associates shipped to New York eighty pounds of the plumes of the large heron and twelve pounds of the little recurved plumes of the snowy heron. In this whole lot there were not over five pounds of plumes that had been gathered from the ground--and these were of little value. The plume-birds have been nearly exterminated in the United States and Mexico, and the same condition of affairs will soon exist in tropical America. This extermination will come about because of the fact that the young are left to starve in the nest when the old birds are killed, any other statement made by interested parties to the contrary notwithstanding. ""I am so incensed at the ridiculously absurd and misleading stories that are being published on this question that I want to give you this letter, and, before delivering it to you, shall take oath to its truthfulness."" Here is the testimony of Mr. Caspar Whitney, of New York, formerly editor of _Outing_ Magazine and _Outdoor America_: ""During extended travel throughout South America, from 1903 to 1907, inclusive, I journeyed, on three separate occasions, by canoe (1904-1907), on the Lower Orinoco and Apure rivers and their tributaries. This is the region, so far as Venezuela is concerned, in which is the greatest slaughter of white herons for their plumage, or more specifically for the marital plumes, which are carried only in the mating and breeding season, and are known in the millinery trade as 'aigrettes.' ""There is literally no room for question. The snowy herons are killed exactly as I describe. It is the custom of all those who hunt for the millinery trade, and is recognized by the natives as the usual method."" Here is the testimony of Mr. Julian A. Dimock, of Peekamose, N.Y., the famous outdoor photographer, and illustrator of ""Florida Enchantments"": ""I know a goodly number of the plume-hunters of Florida. I have camped with them, and talked to them. I have heard their tales, and even full accounts of the 'shooting-up' of an egret rookery. Never has a man in Florida suggested to me that plumes could be obtained without killing the birds. I have known the wardens, and have visited rookeries after they had been 'shot-up,' and the evidence all pointed to the everlasting use of the gun. _It is certainly not true that the plumes can be obtained without killing the birds bearing them_. ""Nineteen years ago, I visited the Cuthbert Rookery with one of the men who discovered the birds nesting in that lake. He and his partner had sold the plumes gathered there for more than a thousand dollars. He showed me how they hid in the bushes and shot the birds. He even gave me a chance to watch him kill two or three birds. ""I know personally the man chiefly responsible for the slaughter of the birds at Alligator Bay. _He laughed at the idea of getting plumes without killing the birds!_ I well know the man who shot the birds up Rogers River, and even saw some of the empty shells left on the ground by him. [Illustration: YOUNG EGRETS, UNABLE TO FLY, STARVING The Parent Birds had Been Killed by Plume Hunters] [Illustration: SNOWY EGRET, DEAD ON HER NEST Wounded in the Feeding-Grounds, and Came Home to Die. Photographed in a Florida Rookery Protected by the National Association of Audubon Societies] I have camped with Seminoles, whites, blacks, outlaws, and those within the pale, connected with plume-hunting, and all tell the same story: _The birds are shot to get the plumes._ The evidence of my own eyes, and the action of the birds themselves, convinces me that there is not a shadow of doubt concerning this point."" This sworn testimony from Mr. T.J. Ashe, of Key West, Florida, is very direct and to the point: ""I have seen many moulted and dropped feathers from wild plumed birds. I have never seen a moulted or dropped feather that was fit for anything. It is the exception when a plumed bird drops feathers of any value while in flight. Whatever feathers are so dropped are those that are frayed, worn out, and forced out by the process of moulting. The moulting season is not during the hatching season, but is after the hatching season. The shedding, or moulting, takes place once a year; and during this moulting season the feathers, after having the hard usage of the year from wind, rain and other causes, when dropped are of absolutely no commercial value."" Mr. Arthur T. Wayne, of Mount Pleasant, S.C., relates in sworn testimony his experience in attempting to secure egret plumes without killing the birds: ""It is utterly impossible to get fifty egret plumes from any colony of breeding birds without shooting the birds. Last spring, I went twice a week to a breeding colony of American and snowy egrets, from early in April until June 8. Despite the fact that I covered miles of territory in a boat, I picked up but two American egret plumes (which I now have); but not a single snowy egret plume did I see, nor did my companion, who accompanied me on every trip. ""I saw an American egret plume on the water, and left it, purposely, to see whether it would sink or not. Upon visiting the place a few days afterwards, the plume was not in evidence, undoubtedly having sunk. The plumes are chiefly shed in the air while the birds are going to or coming from their breeding grounds. If that millinery plume law is repealed, the fate of the American and snowy egrets is sealed, for the few birds that remain will be shot to the very last one."" Any man who ever has been in an egret rookery (and I have) knows that the above testimony is _true_! The French story of the beautiful and smoothly-running egret farms in Venezuela is preposterous, save for a mere shadow of truth. I do not say that _no_ egret plumes could be picked up, but I do assert that the total quantity obtainable in one year in that way would be utterly trivial. No; the ""ospreys"" of the British feather market come from slaughtered egrets and herons, _killed in the breeding season_. Let the British public and the British Parliament make no mistake about that. If they wish the trade to continue, let it be based on the impregnable ground that the merchants want the money, and not on a fantastic dream that is too silly to deceive even a child that knows birds. The use or disuse of wild birds' plumage as millinery ornaments is another of those wild-life subjects regarding which there is no room for argument. To assert that the feather-dealers want the business for the money it brings them is not argument! We have seen many a steam roller go over Truth, and Right, and Justice, by main strength and red-hot power; but Truth and Right refuse to stay flat down. There is on this earth not one wild-animal species--mammal, bird or reptile--that can long withstand exploitation for commercial purposes. Even the whales of the deep sea, the walrus of the arctic regions, the condors of the Andes and alligators of the Everglade morasses are no exception to the universal rule. In Mr. Downham's book there is much fallacious reasoning, and many conclusions that are not borne out by the facts. For example, he says that no species of bird of paradise has been diminished in number by slaughter for the feather trade; that Florida still contains a supply of egrets; that the decrease in bird life should be charged to the spread of cities, towns and farms, and not to the trade; that the trade was ""in no way responsible"" for the slaughter of three hundred thousand gulls and albatrosses on Laysan Island! I have space to notice one other important erroneous conclusion that Mr. Downham publishes in his book, on page 105. He says: ""The destruction of birds in foreign countries is something that no trade can direct or control."" This is an amazing declaration; and absolutely contrary to experience. Let me prove what I say by a fresh and incontestable illustration: Prior to April, 1911, when Governor Dix signed the Bayne law against the sale of wild native game in the State of New York, Currituck County, N.C., was a vast slaughter-pen for wild fowl. No power or persuasion had availed to induce the people of North Carolina to check, or regulate, or in any manner mitigate that slaughter of geese, ducks and swans. It was estimated that two hundred thousand wild fowl were annually slaughtered there. We who advocated the Bayne law said: ""Close the New York markets against Currituck birds, and you will stop a great deal of the slaughter."" We cleaned our Augean stable. The greatest game market in America was absolutely closed. Last winter (1911) the annual killing of wild fowl was fully fifty per cent less than during previous years. In one small town, twenty professional duck shooters went entirely out of business--because they _couldn't sell their ducks_! The dealers refused to buy them. The result was exactly what we predicted it would be; and this year, it is reported over and over that ducks are more plentiful in New England than they have been in twenty years previously! The result is wonderful, because so quick. Beyond all question, the feather merchants of London, Paris and Berlin absolutely control the bird-killers of Venezuela, China, New Guinea. Mexico and South America. Let the word go forth that ""the trade"" is no longer permitted to buy and sell egret and heron plumes, skins of birds of paradise and condor feathers, and presto! the killing industry falls dead the next moment. [Illustration: MISCELLANEOUS BIRD SKINS, 8 CENTS EACH Purchased by the New York Zoological Society from the Quarterly Sale in London, August, 1912] Yes, indeed, members of the British Parliament: it is easily within _your power_ to wipe out at a single stroke fully one-half of the bird slaughter for fancy feathers. It can be done just as we wiped out one-half the annual duck slaughter in wickedly-wasteful North Carolina! The feather trade absolutely _does_ control the killing situation! Now, will the people of England clean house by controlling the feather trade? If a hundred species of the most beautiful birds of the world must be exterminated for the feather trade, let the odium rest elsewhere than on the people of England. The bird-lovers of America may rest assured that the bird-lovers of England--a mighty host--are neither careless nor indifferent regarding the wild-birds' plumage business. On the contrary, several bills have been brought before Parliament intended to regulate or prohibit the traffic, and a measure of vast importance to the birds of the world is now before the House of Commons. It is backed by Mr. Percy Alden, M.P., by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, by the Selbourne Society, and by Mr. James Buckland--a host in himself. For years past that splendidly-equipped and well-managed Royal Society has waged ceaseless warfare for the birds. Its activity has been tremendous, and its membership list contains many of the finest names in England. The address of the Honorary Secretary, Frank E. Lemon, Esq., is 23 Queen Anne's Gate, London, S.W. Naturally, these influences are opposed by the Textile Trade Section of the London Chamber of Commerce, and their only argument consists of the plea that if London doesn't get the money out of the feather trade, the Continent will get it! A reasonable, logical, magnificent and convincing excuse for wholesale bird slaughter, truly! Mr. Buckland has been informed from the Continent that the people of France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are waiting and watching to see what England is going to do with the question, ""To slaughter, or not to slaughter?"" For England has no monopoly of the birds' plumage trade, not by any means. Says Mr. Buckland (""Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill,"" page 17): ""As regards the vast majority of fancy feathers used in millinery, the Continent receives its own supplies. The feathers of the hundreds of thousands of albatrosses which are killed in the North Pacific all go to Paris. Of the untold thousands of 'magpies,' owls, and other species which come from Peru, not one skin or feather crosses the Channel. The white herons of the Upper Senegal and the Niger are being rapidly exterminated at the instigation of the feather merchants, but not one of the plumes reaches London. Paris receives direct a large supply of aigrettes from South America and elsewhere.... The millions of swallows and other migratory birds which are killed annually as they pass through Italy, France and Spain on their way north, supply the millinery trade of Europe with an incredible quantity of wings and other plumage, but none of it is distributed from London.... London, as a distributing center, has no monopoly of the trade in raw feathers."" Mr. Buckland's green-covered pamphlet is a powerful document, and both his facts and his conclusions seem to be unassailable. The author's address is Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Ave., London, W.C. The duty of the civilized nations of Europe is perfectly plain. The savage and bloody business in feathers torn from wild birds should be stopped, completely and forever. If the commons will not arise and reform the odious business out of existence, then the kings and queens and presidents should do their plain duty. In the suppression of a world crime like this it is clearly a case of _noblesse oblige_! * * * * * CHAPTER XIV. THE BIRD TRAGEDY ON LAYSAN ISLAND This chapter is a curtain-dropper to the preceding chapter. As a clearly-cut, concrete case, the reader will find it unique and unsurpassed. It should be of lively interest to every American because the tragedy occurred on American territory. In the far-away North Pacific Ocean, about seven hundred miles from Honolulu west-b'-north, lies the small island of Laysan. It is level, sandy, poorly planted by nature, and barren of all things likely to enlist the attention of predatory man. To the harassed birds of mid-ocean, it seemed like a secure haven, and for ages past it has been inhabited only by them. There several species of sea birds, large and small, have found homes and breeding places. Until 1909, the inhabitants consisted of the Laysan albatross, black-footed albatross, sooty tern, gray-backed tern, noddy tern, Hawaiian tern, white tern, Bonin petrel, two shearwaters, the red-tailed tropic bird, two boobies and the man-of-war bird. Laysan Island is two miles long by one and one-half miles broad, and at times it has been literally covered with birds. Its bird life was first brought prominently to notice in 1891, by Henry Palmer, the agent of Hon. Walter Rothschild, and in 1902 and 1903 Walter K. Fisher and W.A. Bryan made further observations. Ever since 1891 the bird life on Laysan has been regarded as one of the wonders of the bird world. One of the photographs taken prior to 1909 shows a vast plain, apparently a square mile in area, covered and crowded with Laysan albatrosses. They stand there on the level sand, serene, bulky and immaculate. Thousands of birds appear in one view--a very remarkable sight. Naturally man, the ever-greedy, began to cast about for ways by which to convert some product of that feathered host into money. At first guano and eggs were collected. A tramway was laid down and small box-cars were introduced, in which the collected material was piled and pushed down to the packing place. For several years this went on, and the birds themselves were not molested. At last, however, a tentacle of the feather-trade octopus reached out to Laysan. In an evil moment in the spring of 1909, a predatory individual of Honolulu and elsewhere, named Max Schlemmer, decided that the wings of those albatross, gulls and terns should be torn off and sent to Japan, whence they would undoubtedly be shipped to Paris, the special market for the wings of sea-birds slaughtered in the North Pacific. [Illustration: LAYSAN ALBATROSSES, BEFORE THE GREAT SLAUGHTER By the Courtesy of Hon. Walter Rothschild.] [Illustration: LAYSAN ALBATROSS ROOKERY, AFTER THE GREAT SLAUGHTER The Same Ground as Shown in the Preceding Picture, Photographed in 1911 by Prof. Homer R. Dill] Schlemmer the Slaughterer bought a cheap vessel, hired twenty-three phlegmatic and cold-blooded Japanese laborers, and organized a raid on Laysan. With the utmost secrecy he sailed from Honolulu, landed his bird-killers upon the sea-bird wonderland, and turned them loose upon the birds. For several months they slaughtered diligently and without mercy. Apparently it was the ambition of Schlemmer to kill every bird on the island. By the time the bird-butchers had accumulated between three and four car-loads of wings, and the carnage was half finished, William A. Bryan, Professor of Zoology in the College of Honolulu, heard of it and promptly wired the United States Government. Without the loss of a moment the Secretary of the Navy despatched the revenue cutter _Thetis_ to the shambles of Laysan. When Captain Jacobs arrived he found that in round numbers about _three hundred thousand_ birds had been destroyed, and all that remained of them were several acres of bones and dead bodies, and about three carloads of wings, feathers and skins. It was evident that Schlemmer's intention was to kill all the birds on the island, and only the timely arrival of the _Thetis_ frustrated that bloody plan. The twenty-three Japanese poachers were arrested and taken to Honolulu for trial, and the _Thetis_ also brought away all the stolen wings and plumage with the exception of one shedful of wings that had to be left behind on account of lack of carrying space. That old shed, with one end torn out, and supposed to contain nearly fifty thousand pairs of wings, was photographed by Prof. Dill in 1911, as shown herewith. [Illustration: ACRES OF GULL AND ALBATROSS BONES Photographed on Laysan Island by H.R. Dill, 1911] Three hundred thousand albatrosses, gulls, terns and other birds were butchered to make a Schlemmer holiday! Had the arrival of the _Thetis_ been delayed, it is reasonably certain that every bird on Laysan would have been killed to satisfy the wolfish rapacity of one money-grubbing white man. In 1911, the Iowa State University despatched to Laysan a scientific expedition in charge of Prof. Homer R. Dill. The party landed on the island on April 24 and remained until June 5, and the report of Professor Dill (U.S. Department of Agriculture) is consumedly interesting to the friends of birds. Here is what he has said regarding the evidences of bird-slaughter: ""Our first impression of Laysan was that the poachers had stripped the place of bird life. An area of over 300 acres on each side of the buildings was apparently abandoned. Only the shearwaters moaning in their burrows, the little wingless rail skulking from one grass tussock to another, and the saucy finch remained. It is an excellent example of what Prof. Nutting calls the survival of the inconspicuous. ""Here on every side are bones bleaching in the sun, showing where the poachers had piled the bodies of the birds as they stripped them of wings and feathers. In the old open guano shed were seen the remains of hundreds and possibly thousands of wings which were placed there but never cured for shipping, as the marauders were interrupted in their work. [Illustration: SHED PILLED WITH WINGS OF SLAUGHTERED BIRDS ON LAYSAN ISLAND] ""An old cistern back of one of the buildings tells a story of cruelty that surpasses anything else done by these heartless, sanguinary pirates, not excepting the practice of cutting wings from living birds and leaving them to die of hemorrhage. In this dry cistern the living birds were kept by hundreds to slowly starve to death. In this way the fatty tissue lying next to the skin was used up, and the skin was left quite free from grease, so that it required little or no cleaning during preparation. ""Many other revolting sights, such as the remains of young birds that had been left to starve, and birds with broken legs and deformed beaks were to be seen. Killing clubs, nets and other implements used by these marauders were lying all about. Hundreds of boxes to be used in shipping the bird skins were packed in an old building. It was very evident they intended to carry on their slaughter as long as the birds lasted. ""Not only did they kill and skin the larger species but they caught and caged the finch, honey eater, and miller bird. Cages and material for making them were found.""--(Report of an Expedition to Laysan Island in 1911. By Homer R. Dill, page 12.) The report of Professor Bryan contains the following pertinent paragraphs: ""This wholesale killing has had an appalling effect on the colony.... It is conservative to say that fully one-half the number of birds of both species of albatross that were so abundant everywhere in 1903 have been killed. The colonies that remain are in a sadly decimated condition.... Over a large part of the island, in some sections a hundred acres in a place, that ten years ago were thickly inhabited by albatrosses not a single bird remains, while heaps of the slain lie as mute testimony of the awful slaughter of these beautiful, harmless, and without doubt beneficial inhabitants of the high seas. ""While the main activity of the plume-hunters was directed against the albatrosses, they were by no means averse to killing anything in the bird line that came in their way.... Fortunately, serious as were the depredations of the poachers, their operations were interrupted before any of the species had been completely exterminated."" But the work of the Evil Genius of Laysan did not stop with the slaughter of three hundred thousand birds. Mr. Schlemmer introduced rabbits and guinea-pigs; and these rapidly multiplying rodents now are threatening to consume every plant on the island. If the plants disappear, many of the insects will go with them; and this will mean the disappearance of the small insectivorous birds. In February, 1909, President Roosevelt issued an executive order creating the Hawaiian Islands Reservation for Birds. In this are included Laysan and twelve other islands and reefs, some of which are inhabited by birds that are well worth preserving. By this act, we may feel that for the future the birds of Laysan and neighboring islets are secure from further attacks by the bloody-handed agents of the vain women who still insist upon wearing the wings and feathers of wild birds. * * * * * CHAPTER XV UNFAIR FIREARMS, AND SHOOTING ETHICS For considerably more than a century, the States of the American Union have enacted game-protective laws based on the principle that the wild game belongs to the People, and the people's senators, representatives and legislators generally may therefore enact laws for its protection, prescribing the manner in which it may and may not be taken and possessed. The soundness of this principle has been fully confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Geer vs. Connecticut, on March 2, 1896. The tendency of predatory man to kill and capture wild game of all kinds by wholesale methods is as old as the human race. The days of the club, the stone axe, the bow and arrow and the flint-lock gun were contemporaneous with the days of great abundance of game. Now that the advent of breech-loaders, repeaters, automatics and fixed ammunition has rendered game scarce in all localities save a very few, the thoughtful man is driven to consider measures for the checking of destruction and the suppression of wholesale slaughter. First of all, the deadly floating batteries and sail-boats were prohibited. To-day a punt gun is justly regarded as a relic of barbarism, and any man who uses one places himself beyond the pale of decent sportsmanship, or even of modern pot-hunting. Strange to say, although the unwritten code of ethics of English sportsmen is very strict, the English to this day permit wild-fowl hunting with guns of huge calibre, some of which are more like shot-cannons than shot-guns. And they say, ""Well, there are still wild duck on our coast!"" Beyond question, it is now high time for the English people to take up the shot-gun question, and consider what to-day is fair and unfair in the killing of waterfowl. The supply of British ducks and geese can not forever withstand the market gunners and their shot-cannons. Has not the British wild-fowl supply greatly decreased during the past fifteen years? I strongly suspect that a careful investigation would reveal the fact that it has diminished. The Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire should look into the matter, and obtain a series of reports on the condition of the waterfowl to-day as compared with what it was twenty years ago. In the United States we have eliminated the swivel guns, the punt guns and the very-big-bore guns. Among the real sportsmen the tendency is steadily toward shot-guns of small calibre, especially under 12-gauge. But, outside the ranks of sportsmen, we are now face to face with two automatic and five ""pump"" shotguns of deadly efficiency. Of these, more than one hundred thousand are being made and sold annually by the five companies that produce them. Recently the annual output has been carefully estimated from known facts to be about as follows: Winchester Arms Co., New Haven, Conn. (1 Automatic and 1 Pump-gun) 50,000 guns. Remington Arms Co., Ilion, N.Y. (1 Automatic and 1 Pump-gun) 25,000 "" Marlin Fire Arms Co., New Haven, Conn. 1 Pump-gun 12,000 "" Stevens Arms Co., Chicopee Falls, Mass. 1 Pump-gun 10,000 "" Union Fire Arms Co., 1 Pump-gun 5,000 "" ------------ 103,000 guns [Illustration: FOUR OF THE SEVEN MACHINE GUNS STEVENS PUMP GUN, 6 SHOTS IN 6 SECONDS. WINCHESTER PUMP GUN, 6 SHOTS IN 6 SECONDS. REMINGTON AUTOMATIC, 5 SHOTS IN 4 SECONDS. Loaded and cocked by its own recoil. WINCHESTER AUTOLOADING. 5 SHOTS IN 4 SECONDS Loaded and cocked by its own recoil.] THE ETHICS OF SHOOTING AND SHOT-GUNS.--Are the American people willing that their wild birds shall be shot by machinery? In the ethics of sportsmanship, the anglers of America are miles ahead of the men who handle the rifle and shot-gun in the hunting field. Will the hunters ever catch up? The anglers have steadily diminished the weight of the rod and the size of the line; and they have prohibited the use of gang hooks and nets. In this respect the initiative of the Tuna Club of Santa Catalina is worthy of the highest admiration. Even though the leaping tuna, the jewfish and the sword-fish are big and powerful, the club has elected to raise the standard of sportsmanship by making captures more difficult than ever before. A higher degree of skill, and nerve and judgment, is required in the angler who would make good on a big fish; and, incidentally, the fish has about double ""the show"" that it had fifteen years ago. That is Sportsmanship! But how is it with the men who handle the shot-gun? By them, the Tuna Club's high-class principle has been exactly reversed! In the making of fishing-rods, commercialism plays small part; but in about forty cases out of every fifty the making of guns is solely a matter of dollars and profits. Excepting the condemnation of automatic and pump guns, I think that few clubs of sportsmen have laid down laws designed to make shooting more difficult, and to give the game more of a show to escape. Thousands of gentlemen sportsmen have their own separate unwritten codes of honor, but so far as I know, few of them have been written out and adopted as binding rules of action. I know that among expert wing shots it is an unwritten law that quail and grouse must not be shot on the ground, nor ducks on the water. But, among the three million gunners who annually shoot in the United States how many, think you, are there who in actual practice observe any sentimental principles when in the presence of killable game? I should say about one man and boy out of every five hundred. Up to this time, the great mass of men who handle guns have left it to the gunmakers to make their codes of ethics, and hand them out with the loaded cartridges, all ready for use. For fifty years the makers of shot-guns and rifles have taxed their ingenuity and resources to make killing easier, especially for ""amateur"" sportsmen,--_and take still greater advantages of the game_! Look at this scale of progression: FIFTY YEARS' INCREASE IN THE DEADLINESS OF FIREARMS. KIND OF GUN. ESTIMATED DEGREE OF DEADLINESS. Single-shot muzzle loader xx 10 Single-shot breech-loader xxxxxx 30 Double-barrel breech-loader xxxxxxxxxx 50 Choke-bore breech-loader xxxxxxxxxxxx 60 Repeating rifle xxxxxxxxxxxx 60 Repeating rifle, with silencer xxxxxxxxxxxxxx 70 ""Pump"" shot-gun (6 shots) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 90 Automatic or ""autoloading"" shot-guns, 5 shots xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 100 _The Output of 1911_.--At a recent hearing before a committee of the House of Representatives at Washington, a representative of the gun-making industry reported that in the year 1911 ten American manufacturing concerns turned out the following: 391,875 shot-guns, 666,643 rifles, and 580,042 revolvers. There are 66 factories producing firearms and ammunition, employing $39,377,000 of invested capital and 15,000 employees. The sole and dominant thought of many gunmakers is to make the very deadliest guns that human skill can invent, sell them as fast as possible, and declare dividends on their stock. The Remington, Winchester, Marlin, Stevens and Union Companies are engaged in a mad race to see who can turn out the deadliest guns, and the most of them. On the market to-day there are five pump-guns, that fire six shots each, in about _six seconds_, without removal from the shoulder, by the quick sliding of a sleeve under the barrel, that ejects the empty shell and inserts a loaded one. There are two automatics that fire five shots each in _five seconds or less_, by five pulls on the trigger! _The autoloading gun is reloaded and cocked again wholly by its own recoil_. Now, if these are not machine guns, what are they? In view of the great scarcity of feathered game, and the number of deadly machine guns already on the market, the production of the last and deadliest automatic gun (by the Winchester Arms Company), _already in great demand_, is a crime against wild life, no less. Every human action is a matter of taste and individual honor. It is natural for the duck-butchers of Currituck to love the automatic shot-guns as they do, because they kill the most ducks per flock. With two of them in his boat, holding _ten shots_, one expert duck-killer can,--and sometimes _actually does_, so it is said,--get every duck out of a flock, up to seven or eight. It is natural for an awkward and blundering wing-shot to love the deadliest gun, in order that he may make as good a bag as an expert shot can make with a double-barreled gun. It is natural for the hunter who does not care a rap about the extermination of species to love the gun that will enable him to kill up to the bag limit, every time he takes the field. It is natural for men who don't think, or who think in circles, to say ""so long as I observe the lawful bag limit, what difference does it make what kind of a gun I use?"" It is natural for the Remington, and Winchester, and Marlin gun-makers to say, as they do, ""Enforce the laws! Shorten the open seasons! Reduce the bag limit, and then it won't matter what guns are used! But,--DON'T touch autoloading guns! Don't hamper Inventive Genius!"" Is it not high time for American sportsmen to cease taking their moral principles and their codes of ethics from the gun-makers? Here is a question that I would like to put before every hunter of game in America: In view of the alarming scarcity of game, in view of the impending extermination of species by legal hunting, can any high-minded _sportsman_, can any _good citizen_ either sell a machine shot-gun or use one in hunting? A gentleman is incapable of taking an unfair advantage of any wild creature; therefore a gentleman cannot use punt guns for ducks, dynamite for game fish, or automatic or pump guns in bird-shooting. The machine guns and ""silencers"" are grossly unfair, and like gang-hooks, nets and dynamite for trout and bass, their use in hunting must everywhere be prohibited by law. Times have changed, and the lines for protection must be more tightly drawn. [Illustration: THE CHAMPION GAME SLAUGHTER CASE One Hour's Slaughter (218 Geese) With Two Automatic Shot-Guns] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (Judge Orlady) has decided that the Pennsylvania law against the use of automatic guns in hunting is entirely constitutional, because every state has a right to say how its game may and may not be killed. It is up to the American People to say _now_ whether their wild life shall be slaughtered by machinery, or not. If they are willing that it should be, then let us be consistent and say--away with all ""conservation!"" The game conservators can endure a gameless and birdless continent quite as well as the average citizen can. HOW THEY WORK.--There are a few apologists for the automatic and pump guns who cheerfully say, ""So long as the bag limit is observed what difference does it make how the birds are killed?"" It is strange that a conscientious man should ask such a question, when the answer is apparent. We reply, ""The difference is that an automatic or pump gun will kill fully twice as many waterfowl as a double-barrel, _if not more_; and _it is highly undesirable that every gunner should get the bag limit of birds, or any number near it_! The birds can not stand it. Moreover, _the best states for ducks and geese have no bag limits on those birds_!"" To-day, on Currituck Sound, for example, the market hunters are killing all the waterfowl they can sell. On Marsh Island, Louisiana, one man has killed 369 ducks in one day, and another market gunner killed 430 in one day. The automatic and the ""pump"" shot-guns are the favorite weapons of the game-hog who makes a specialty of geese and ducks. It is no uncommon thing for a gunner who shoots a machine gun to get, with one gun, as high as _eight_ birds out of one flock. A man who has himself done this has told me so. _The Champion Game-Slaughter Case_.--Here is a story from California that is no fairy tale. It was published, most innocently, in a western magazine, with the illustration that appears herewith, and in which please notice the automatic shot-gun: ""February 5th, I and a friend were at one of the Glenn County Club's camps.... Neither of us having ever had the pleasure of shooting over live decoys, we were anxious, and could hardly wait for the sport to commence. On arriving at the scene we noticed holes which had been dug in the ground, just large enough for a man to crawl into. These holes were used for hiding places, and were deep enough so the sportsmen would be entirely out of sight of the game. The birds are so wild that to move a finger will frighten them.... ""The decoys are wild geese which had been crippled and tamed for this purpose. They are placed inside of silk net fences which are located on each side of the holes dug for hiding places. These nets are the color of the ground and it is impossible for the wild geese flying overhead to detect the difference. ""After we had investigated everything the expert caller and owner of the outfit exclaimed: 'Into your holes!' ""We noticed in the distance a flock of geese coming. Our caller in a few seconds had their attention, and they headed towards our decoys. Soon they were directly over us, but out of easy range of our guns. We were anxious to shoot, but in obedience to our boss had to keep still, and soon noticed that the birds were soaring around and in a short time were within fifteen or twenty feet of us. At that moment we heard the command, 'Punch 'em!' and the bombardment that followed was beyond imagining. _We had fired five shots apiece and found we had bagged ten geese from this one flock_. ""At the end of one hour's shooting we had 218 birds to our credit and were out of ammunition. ""On finding that no more shells were in our pits we took our dead geese to the camp and returned with a new supply of ammunition. We remained in the pits during the entire day. When the sun had gone behind the mountains we summed up our kill and _it amounted to 450 geese_! ""The picture shown with this article gives a view of _the first hour's shoot_. A photograph would have been taken of the remainder of the shoot, but it being warm weather the birds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling. [Illustration: SLAUGHTERED ACCORDING TO LAW A Result of a Faulty System. Such Pictures as this are Very Common in Sportsmen's Magazines Note the Automatic Gun] ""Supper was then eaten, after which we were driven back to Willows; both agreeing that it was one of the greatest days of sport we ever had, and wishing that we might, through the courtesy of the Glenn County Goose Club, have another such day. C.H.B."" Another picture was published in a Canadian magazine, illustrating a story from which I quote: ""I fixed the decoys, hid my boat and took my position in the blind. My man started his work with a will and hustled the ducks out of every cove, inlet or piece of marsh for two miles around. I had barely time to slip the cartridges into my guns--_one a double and the other a five shot automatic_--when I saw a brace of birds coming toward me. They sailed in over my decoys. I rose to the occasion, and the leader up-ended and tumbled in among the decoys. The other bird, unable to stop quick enough, came directly over me. He closed his wings and struck the ground in the rear of the blind. ""More and more followed. Sometimes they came singly, and then in twos and threes. I kept busy and attended to each bird as quickly as possible. Whenever there was a lull in the flight I went out in the boat and picked up the dead, leaving the wounded to take chances with any gunner lucky enough to catch them in open and smooth water. A bird handy in the air is worth two wounded ones in the water. _Twice I took six dead birds out of the water for seven shots, and both guns empty_. ""The ball thus opened, the birds commenced to move in all directions. Until the morning's flight was over I was kept busy pumping lead, _first with the 10, then with the automatic_, reloading, picking up the dead, etc."" And the reader will observe that the harmless, innocent, inoffensive automatic shot gun, that ""don't matter if you enforce the bag limit,"" figures prominently in both stories and both photographs. _A Story of Two Pump Guns and Geese_:--It comes from Aberdeen, S.D. (Sand Lake), in the spring of 1911. Mr. J.J. Humphrey tells it, in _Outdoor Life_ magazine for July, 1911. ""Smith and I were about a hundred yards from them [the flock of Canada geese], when Murphy scared them. They rose in a dense mass and came directly between Smith and me. We were about gunshot distance apart, and they were not over thirty feet in the air when we opened up on them with our pump guns and No. 5 shot. When the smoke cleared away and we had rounded up the cripples we found we had twenty-one geese. I have heard of bigger killings out in this country, but never positively knew of them."" So then: _those two gunners averaged 10-1/2 wild geese per pump gun out of one flock_! And yet there are wise and reflective sportsmen who say, ""What difference does the kind of gun make so long as you live up to the law?"" I think that the pump and automatic guns make about 75 _per-cent of difference, against the game_; that is all! The number of shot-guns now in use in the United States is almost beyond belief. About six years ago a gentleman interested in the manufacture of such weapons informed me, and his statement has never been disputed, that _every year_ about 500,000 new shot-guns were sold in the United States. The number of shot cartridges annually produced by our four great cartridge companies has been reliably estimated as follows: Winchester Arms Co 300,000,000 Union Metallic Cartridge Co 250,000,000 Peters Cartridge Co 150,000,000 Western Cartridge Co 75,000,000 ----------- 775,000,000 We must stop all the holes in the barrel, or eventually lose all the water. No group of bird-slaughterers is entitled to immunity. We will not ""limit the bag, and enforce the laws,"" while we permit the makers and users of autoloading and pump guns to kill at will, as they demand. * * * * * [Illustration: Copy of letter: National Association of Audubon Societies Founded 1901.

Feb. 26th 1906. My dear Mr. Hornaday:-- It is with much surprise that I learn through your communication of even date that certain persons are claiming that the National Association of Audubon Societies for the Protection of Wild Animals and Birds is in favor of the use of automatic or pump guns, and consequently is not in favor of the passage of laws to prevent the use or sale of such firearms. I beg officially to state that the National Association of Audubon Societies is absolutely opposed to either the manufacture, sale, or use of such firearms, and therefore hopes that the meritorious bill introduced by the New York Zoological Society will become a law. I beg further to add that any statement contrary to the above in effect is unauthorized. This society is working for the preservation of the wild birds and game of North America, and it sincerely should not stultify itself by advocating the use of one of the most potent means of destruction that has ever been devised. You are at liberty to use this communication either publicly or privately. Very sincerely yours, [Signature: William Dutcher] President. A LETTER THAT TELLS ITS OWN STORY] * * * * * Yes; we _will_ ""limit the bag"" and ""enforce the laws;"" but the machine guns and the alien shooters shall be eliminated at the same time! Each state has the power to regulate, absolutely, down to the smallest detail, the manner in which the game of The People shall be taken or not taken; and such laws are absolutely constitutional. If we can legislate punt guns and dynamite out of use, the machine guns and silencers can be treated similarly. _No immunity for wild-life exterminators_. The following unprejudiced testimony from a New York business man who is a sportsman, with a fine game preserve of his own, should be of general interest. It was written to G.O. Shields, March 21, 1906. DEAR SIR: Regarding the use of the automatic shot-gun, would say that I am a member of two southern ducking clubs where these guns are used very extensively. I have seen a flock of ducks come into a blind where one, two, or even three of these guns were in use, and have seen as many as eleven shots poured into a single flock. We have considerable poaching on one of these clubs, the territory being so extensive that it is impossible to prevent it. We own 60,000 acres, and these poachers, I am told, nearly all use the automatic guns. They frequently kill six or eight ducks out of one flock--first taking a raking shot on the water, and then getting in the balance of the magazine before the flock is out of range. In fact, some of them carry two guns, and are able to discharge a part of the second magazine into the same flock. As I told you the other evening, I am not so much against the gun when in the hands of gentlemen and real sportsmen, but, on account of its terrible possibilities for market hunters, I believe that the only safe way is to abolish it entirely, and that the better class should be willing to give up this weapon as being the only means of putting a stop to this willful game slaughter. Very truly yours, ARTHUR ROBINSON. * * * * * HOW GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN REGARD AUTOMATIC AND PUMP GUNS Each one of the following organizations, chiefly clubs of gentlemen sportsmen, have adopted strong resolutions condemning the use of automatic guns in hunting, and either requesting or recommending the enactment of laws against their use: New York Zoological Society ...

It shall be unlawful to use in hunting or shooting birds or animals of any kind, any automatic or repeating shot gun or pump gun, or any shot-gun holding more than two cartridges at one time, or that may be fired more than twice without removal from the shoulder for reloading. Section 2. Violation of any provision of this act shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five nor more than one hundred dollars for each offence; and the carrying, or possession in the woods, or in any field, or upon any water of any gun or other weapon the use of which is prohibited, as aforesaid, shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of this act. _The English 3-barrel ""Scatter Rifle,"" for Ducks_.--All gunners who find machine guns good enough for them will be delighted by the news that an Englishman whose identity is concealed under the initials ""F.M.M."" has invented and manufactured a 3-barreled rifle specially intended to kill ducks that are beyond the reach of a choke-bore shotgun. The weapon discharges all three barrels simultaneously. In the _London Field_, of Dec. 9, 1911, it is described by a writer who also thoughtfully conceals his identity under a nom-de-plume. After a trial of 48 shots, the writer declares that ""the 3-barreled is a really practicable weapon,"" and that with it one could bag wild-fowl that were quite out of reach of any shot-gun. Just why a Gatling gun or a Maxim should not be employed for the same purpose, the writer fails to state. The use of either would be quite as sportsmanlike, and as fair to the game. There are great possibilities in ducking mortars, also. _The ""Sunday Gun.""_--A new weapon of peculiar form and great deadliness to song birds, has recently come into use. Because of the manner of its use, it is known as the ""Sunday gun."" It is specially adapted to concealment on the person. A man could go through a reception with one of these deadly weapons absolutely concealed under his dress coat! It is a weapon with two barrels, rifle and shot; and it enables the user to kill anything from a humming-bird up to a deer. What the shot-barrel can not kill, the rifle will. It is not a gun that any sportsman would own, save as a curiosity, or for target use. The State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, Mr. E.H. Forbush, informs me that already the ""Sunday gun"" has become a scourge to the bird life of that state. Thousands of them are used by men and boys who live in cities and towns, and are able to get into the country only on Sundays. They conceal them under their coats, on Sunday mornings, go out into the country, and spend the day in shooting small birds and mammals. The dead birds are concealed in various pockets, the Sunday gun goes under the coat, and at nightfall the guerrilla rides back to the city with an innocent smile on his face, as if he had spent a day in harmless enjoyment of the beauties of nature. The ""Sunday gun"" is on sale everywhere, and it is said to be in use both by American and Italian killers of song-birds. It weighs only two pounds, eight ounces, and its cost is so trifling that any guerrilla who wishes one can easily find the money for its purchase. There are in the United States at least a million men and boys quite mean enough to use this weapon on song-birds, swallows, woodpeckers, nuthatches, rabbits and squirrels, and like other criminals, hide both weapon and loot in their clothing. So long as this gun is in circulation, no small bird is safe, at any season, near any city or town. Now, what are the People going to do about it? My recommendation is that each state enact a law in the following terms: Be it enacted, etc.--That from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any person to use in hunting, or to carry concealed on the person, any shotgun, or rifle, or combination of shotgun and rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than twenty-eight inches in length, or with a skeleton stock fixed on a hinge. The carrying of any rifle or shotgun concealed on the person shall constitute a felony. The penalties for hunting with any gun specially adapted to concealment should be not less than $50 fine or two months imprisonment at hard labor, and the carrying of such weapons concealed should be $100 or four months at hard labor. Incidentally, we wonder what will be the next devilish device for the destruction of wild life that American inventive genius will produce. [Illustration: THE ""SUNDAY GUN!"" A Deadly Combination of Concealable Rifle-and-Shot-Gun.] [Illustration: THE WILDERNESS OF NORTH AMERICA (SHADED) AND THE ARCTIC PRAIRIES, WELL STOCKED WITH BIG GAME] * * * * * CHAPTER XVI THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAME The subject of this chapter opens up a vast field of facts and conclusions, quite broad enough to fill a whole volume. In the space at our disposal here it is possible to offer only a summary of the subject, without attempting to prove our statements by the production of detailed evidence. To say that all over the world, the large land mammals are being destroyed more rapidly than they are breeding, would not be literally true, for the reason that there are yet many areas that are almost untouched by the destroying hand of civilized man. It is true, however, that all the unspoiled areas rapidly are growing fewer and smaller. It is also true that in all the regions of the earth that are easily penetrable by civilized man, the wild life is being killed faster than it breeds, and of necessity it is disappearing. This is why the British are now so urgently bestirring themselves to create game preserves in all the countries that they own. It is one of the inexorable laws of Nature, to which I know of not one exception, that large hoofed animals which live on open plains, on open mountains, or in regions that are thinly forested, always are easily found and easily exterminated. All such animals have a weak hold on life. This is because it is so difficult for them to hide, and so very easy for man to creep up within the killing range of modern, high-power, long-range rifles. Is it not pitiful to think of animals like the caribou, moose, white sheep and bear trying to survive on the naked ridges and bald mountains of Yukon Territory and Alaska! With a modern rifle, the greatest duffer on earth can creep up within killing distance of any of the big game of the North. The gray wolf is practically the only large animal that is able to hide successfully and survive in the treeless regions of the North; but his room is always preferable to his company, because he, too, is a destroyer of big game. I am tempted to try to map out roughly what are to-day the unopened and undestroyed wild haunts of big game in North America. In doing this, however, I warn the reader not to be deceived into thinking that because game still exists in those regions, those areas therefore constitute a permanent preserve and safe breeding-ground for large mammals. That is very, very far from being the case. The further ""opening up"" of the wilderness areas, as I shall call them for convenience, can and surely will quickly wipe out their big game; for throughout nine-tenths of those areas it holds to life by very slender threads. To-day the unopened and undestroyed wilderness areas of North America, wherein large mammals still live in a normal wild state, are in general as follows: THE ARCTIC BARREN GROUNDS, or Arctic Prairies, north of the limit of trees, embracing the Barren Grounds of northern Canada, the great arctic archipelago, Ellesmere, Melville and Grant Lands and Greenland. This region is the home of the musk-ox and three species of arctic caribou. THE ALASKA-YUKON REGION, inhabited by the moose, white mountain sheep, mountain goat, four species of caribou, and half a dozen species of Alaska brown, grizzly and black bears. NORTHERN ONTARIO, QUEBEC, LABRADOR AND NEWFOUNDLAND, inhabited by moose, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer and black bear. BRITISH COLUMBIA, inhabited by a magnificent big-game fauna embracing the moose, elk, caribou of two species, white sheep, black sheep, big-horn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, grizzly, black and inland white bears. THE SIERRA MADRE OF MEXICO, containing jaguar, puma, _grizzly_ and black bears, mule deer, white-tailed deer, antelope, mountain sheep and peccaries. I have necessarily omitted all those regions of the United States and Canada that still contain a remnant of big game, but have been literally ""shot to pieces"" by gunners. In the United States and southern Canada there are about fifteen localities which contain a supply of big game sufficient that a conscientious sportsman might therein hunt and kill one head per year with a clear conscience. _All others should be closed for five years_! Here is the list of availables; and regarding it there will be about as many opinions as there are big-game sportsmen: * * * * * HUNTING GROUNDS IN AND NEAR THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTHERN CANADA WHEREIN IT IS RIGHT TO HUNT BIG GAME THE MAINE WOODS: Well stocked with white-tailed deer. NEW BRUNSWICK: Well stocked with moose; a few caribou, deer and black bear. WHITE MOUNTAINS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT: For deer. THE ADIRONDACKS, NEW YORK: Well stocked with white-tailed deer, only. PENNSYLVANIA MOUNTAINS: Contain many deer and black bears, and soon will contain more. NORTHERN MINNESOTA: Deer and moose. NORTHERN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN: White-tailed deer. NORTHWESTERN WYOMING: Thousands of elk in fall and winter; a few deer, grizzly and black bears, but no sheep that it would be right to kill. WESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA: Elk in season, mule and white-tail deer; no sheep that it would be right to kill. NORTHWESTERN MONTANA: Mule and white-tailed deer, only. No sheep, bear, moose, elk or antelope _to kill_! WYOMING, EAST OF YELLOWSTONE PARK: A few elk, by migration from the Park; a few deer, and bear of two species. NORTHERN WOODS OF ONTARIO AND QUEBEC: Moose; deer. SOUTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA: Goat, a few sheep and deer; grizzly bear. Moose, caribou and elk should not be killed. NORTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA: Six fine species of big game. NORTHWESTERN ALBERTA: Grizzly bear, big-horn and mountain goat. Under existing conditions I regard the above-named hunting grounds as _nearly all_ in which it is right or fair for big-game hunting now to be permitted, even on a strict basis. Nearly all others should immediately be closed, for large game, for ten years. Of course such a proceeding, if carried into effect, would provoke loud protests from sportsmen, gunners, game-hogs, pot-hunters and others; but I only wish to high heaven that we had the power to carry such a program as that into effect! _Then we would see some game in ten years_; and our grand-children would thank us for some real big-game protection at a critical period. Except in the few localities above-mentioned, I regard the big-game situation in the United States and southern Canada as particularly desperate. Unless there is an immediate and complete revolution in this country from an era of slaughter to an era of preservation, as sure as the sun rises on the morrow, outside of the hard and fast game preserves, and places like Maine and the Adirondacks, this generation of Americans and near-Americans will live to see our country _swept clean of big game_! Two years ago, I did not believe this; but I do now. It is impossible to exaggerate the wide extent or the seriousness of this situation. In a country where any and every individual can rise and bluster, ""I'm-just-as-good-as-_you_-are,"" and bellow for his ""rights"" as a ""tax-payer,"" there is no stopping the millions who kill whenever there is an open season. And to many Americans, no right is dearer than the right to kill the game which by even the commonest law of equity belongs, not to the shooter exclusively, but partly to two thousand other persons who don't shoot at all! Unless we come to an ""About, face!"" in quick time, all our big game outside the preserves is doomed to sure and quick extermination. This is not an individual opinion, merely: it is a _fact_; and a hundred thousand men know it to be such. Last winter (1911-12), because the deer of Montana were driven by cold and hunger out of the mountains and far down into the ranchmen's valleys, eleven thousand of them were ruthlessly slaughtered. State Game Warden Avare says that often heads of families took out as many licenses as there were persons in the family, and the whole quota was killed. Such people deserve to go deerless into the future; but we can not allow them to rob innocent people. * * * * * OUR SPECIES OF BIG GAME THE PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE, unique and wonderful, will be one of _the first species of North American big game to become totally extinct_. We may see this come to pass within twenty years. They can not be bred in protection, _save in very large fenced ranges_. They are delicate, capricious, and easily upset. They die literally ""at the drop of a hat."" They are quite subject to actinomycosis (lumpy-jaw), which in wild animals is incurable. Already all the states that possess wild antelope, except Nevada, have passed laws giving that species long close seasons; which is highly creditable to the states that have done their duty. Nevada must get in line at the next session of her legislature! In 1908, Dr. T.S. Palmer published in his annual report of ""Progress in Game Protection"" the following in regard to the prong-horned antelope: ""Antelope are still found in diminished numbers in fourteen western states. A considerable number were killed during the year in Montana, where the species seems to have suffered more than elsewhere since the season was opened in 1907. ""A striking illustration of the decrease of the antelope is afforded by Colorado. In 1898 the State Warden estimated that there were 25,000 in the state, whereas in 1908 the Game Commissioner places the number at only 2,000. The total number of antelope now in the United States probably does not exceed 17,000, distributed approximately as follows: Colorado 2,000 Yellowstone Park 2,000 Idaho 200 Other States 2,000 Montana 4,000 ----- New Mexico 1,300 Saskatchewan 2,000 Oregon 1,500 ----- Wyoming 4,000 19,000 To-day (1912), Dr. Palmer says the total number of antelope is less than it was in 1908, and in spite of protection the number is steadily diminishing. This is indeed serious news. The existing bands, already small, are steadily growing smaller. The antelope are killed lawlessly, and the crimes of such slaughter are, in nearly every instance, successfully concealed. Previously, we have based strong hopes for the preservation of the antelope species on the herd in the Yellowstone Park, but those animals are vanishing fearfully fast. In 1906, Dr. Palmer reported that ""About fifteen hundred antelope came down to the feeding grounds near the haystacks in the vicinity of Gardiner."" In 1908 the Yellowstone Park was credited with two thousand head. _To-day, the number alive, by actual count, is only five hundred head_; and this after twenty-five years of protection! Where have the others gone? This shows, alas! that perpetual close seasons can not _always_ bring back the vanished thousands of game! [Illustration: PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE] Here is a reliable report (June 29, 1912) regarding the prong-horned antelope in Lower California, from E.W. Nelson: ""Antelope formerly ranged over nearly the entire length of Lower California, but are now gone from a large part of their ancient range, and their steadily decreasing numbers indicate their early extinction throughout the peninsula."" In captivity the antelope is exasperatingly delicate and short-lived. It has about as much stamina as a pet monkey. As an exhibition animal in zoological gardens and parks it is a failure; for it always looks faded, spiritless and dead, like a stuffed animal ready to be thrown into the discard. Zoologists can not save the prong-horn species save at long range, in preserves so huge that the sensitive little beast will not even suspect that it is confined. Two serious attempts have been made to transplant and acclimatize the antelope--in the Wichita National Bison Range, in Oklahoma, and in the Montana Bison Range, at Ravalli. In 1911 the Boone and Crockett Club provided a fund which defrayed the expenses of shipping from the Yellowstone Park a small nucleus herd to each of those ranges. Eight were sent to the Wichita Range, of which five arrived alive. Of the seven sent to the Montana Range, four arrived alive and were duly set free. While it seems a pity to take specimens from the Yellowstone Park herd, the disagreeable fact is that there is no other source on which to draw for breeding stock. The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, in Canada, still permit the hunting and killing of antelope; which is wholly and entirely wrong. THE BIG-HORN SHEEP.--Of North American big game, the big-horn of the Rockies will be, after the antelope, the next species to become extinct outside of protected areas. In the United States that event is fast approaching. It is far nearer than even the big-game sportsmen realize. There are to-day only two localities in the four states that still _think_ they have killable sheep, in which it is worth while to go sheep-hunting. One is in Montana, and the other is in Wyoming. In the United States a really big, creditable ram may now be regarded as an impossibility. There are now perhaps half a dozen guides who can find killable sheep in our country, but the game is nearly always young rams, under five years of age. That Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Washington still continue to permit sheep slaughter is outrageous. Their answer is that ""The sportsmen won't stand for stopping it altogether."" I will add:--and the great mass of people are too criminally indifferent to take a hand in the matter, and _do their duty_ regardless of the men of blood. The seed stock of big-horn sheep now alive in the United States aggregates a pitifully small number. After twenty-five years of unbroken protection in Colorado, Dillon Wallace estimates, after an investigation on the ground, that the state possesses perhaps thirty-five hundred head. He credits Montana and Wyoming with five hundred each--which I think is far too liberal a number. I do not believe that either of those states contains more than one hundred unprotected sheep, at the very utmost limit. If there are more, where are they? In the Yellowstone Park there are 210 head, safe and sound, and slowly increasing. I can not understand why they have not increased more rapidly than they have. In Glacier Park, now under permanent protection, three guides on Lake McDonald, in 1910, estimated the number of sheep at seven hundred. Idaho has in her rugged Bitter Root and Clearwater Mountains and elsewhere, a remnant of possibly two hundred sheep, and Washington has only what chemists call ""a trace."" It has recently been discovered that California still contains a few sheep, and in southwestern Nevada there are a few more. In Utah, the big-horn species is probably quite extinct. In Arizona, there are a few very small bands, very widely scattered. They are in the Santa Catalina Mountains, the Grand Canyon country, the Gila Range, and the Quitovaquita Mountains, near Sonoyta. But who can protect from slaughter those Arizona sheep? Absolutely no one! They are too few and too widely scattered for the game wardens to keep in touch with them. The ""prospectors"" have them entirely at their mercy, and the world well knows what prospectors' ""mercy"" to edible big game looks like on the ground. It leads straight to the frying-pan, the coyotes and the vultures. The Lower California peninsula contains about five hundred mountain sheep, without the slightest protection save low, desert mountains, heat and thirst. But that is no real protection whatever. Those sheep are too fine to be butchered the way they have been, and now are being butchered. In 1908 I strongly called the attention of the Mexican Government to the situation; and the Departmento de Fomento secured the issue of an executive order forbidding the hunting of any big game in Lower California without the written authority of the government. I am sure, however, that owing to the political and military upheaval it never stopped the slaughter of sheep. In such easy mountains as those of Lower California, it is a simple matter to exterminate quickly all the mountain sheep that they possess. The time for President Madero and his cabinet to inaugurate serious protective measures has fully arrived. Both British Columbia and Alberta have even yet fine herds of big-horn, and we can count three large game preserves in which they are protected. They are Goat Mountain Park (East Kootenay district, between the Elk and Bull Rivers); the Rocky Mountains Park, near Banff, and Waterton Lakes Park, in the southwestern corner of Alberta. In view of the number of men who desire to hunt them, the bag limit on big-horn rams in British Columbia and Alberta still is too liberal, by half. One ram per year for one man is _quite enough_; quite as much so as one moose is the limit everywhere. To-day ""a big, old ram"" is regarded by sportsmen as a much more desirable and creditable trophy than a moose; because moose-killing is easy, and the bagging of an old mountain ram in real mountains requires five times as much effort and skill. The splendid high and rugged mountains of British Columbia and Alberta form an ideal home for the big-horn (and mountain goat), and it would be an international calamity for that region to be denuded of its splendid big game. With resolute intent and judicial treatment that region can remain a rich and valuable hunting ground for five hundred years to come. Under falsely ""liberal"" laws, it can be shot into a state of complete desolation within ten years, or even less. OTHER MOUNTAIN SHEEP.--In northern British Columbia, north of Iskoot Lake, there lies a tremendous region, extending to the Arctic Ocean, and comprehending the whole area between the Rocky Mountain continental divide and the waters of the Pacific. Over the southern end of this great wilderness ranges the black mountain sheep, and throughout the remainder, with many sheepless intervals, is scattered the white mountain sheep. Owing to the immensity of this wilderness, the well-nigh total lack of railroads and also of navigable waters, excepting the Yukon, it will not be thoroughly ""opened up"" for a quarter of a century. The few resolute and pneumonia-proof sportsmen who can wade into the country, pulling boats through icy-cold mountain streams, are not going to devastate those millions of mountains of their big game. The few head of game which sportsmen can and will take out of the great northwestern wilderness during the next twenty-five years will hardly be missed from the grand total, even though a few easily-accessible localities are shot out. It is the deadly resident trappers, hunters and prospectors who must be feared! And again,--_who_ can control them? Can any wilderness government on earth make it possible? Therefore, _in time, even the great wilderness will be denuded of big game_. This is absolutely fixed and certain; for within much less than another century, every square rod of it will have been gone over by prospectors, lumbermen, trappers and skin-hunters, and raked again and again with fine-toothed combs. A railway line to Dawson, the Copper River and Cook Inlet is to-day merely the next thing to expect, after Canada's present railway program has been wrought out. Yes, indeed! In time the wilderness will be opened up, and the big game will _all_ be shot out, save from the protected areas. THE MOUNTAIN GOAT.--Even yet, this species is not wholly extinct in the United States. It survives in Glacier Park, Montana, and the number estimated in that region by three guide friends is too astoundingly large to mention. This animal is much more easily killed than the big-horn. Its white coat renders it fatally conspicuous at long range during the best hunting season; it is almost devoid of fear, and it takes altogether too many chances on man. Thanks to the rage for sheep horns, the average sportsman's view-point regarding wild life ranks a goat head about six contours below ""old ram"" heads, in desirability. Furthermore, most guides regard the flesh of the goat as almost unfit for use as food, and far inferior to that of the big-horn. These reasons, taken together, render the goats much less persecuted by the sportsmen, ranchmen and prospectors who enter the home of the two species. It was because of this indifference toward goats that in 1905 Mr. John M. Phillips and his party saw 243 goats in thirty days in Goat Mountain Park, and only fourteen sheep. Unless the preferences of western sportsmen and gunners change very considerably, the coast mountains of the great northwestern wilderness will remain stocked with wild mountain goats until long after the last big-horn has been shot to death. Fortunately, the skin of the mountain goat has no commercial value. I think it was in 1887 that I purchased, in Denver, 150 nicely tanned skins of our wild white goat _at fifty cents each_! They were wanted for the first exhibit ever made to illustrate the extermination of American large mammals, and they were shown at the Louisville Exposition. It must have cost the price of those skins to tan them; and I was pleased to know that some one lost money on the venture. [Illustration MAP OF THE FORMER AND EXISTING RANGES OF THE AMERICAN ELK From ""Life History of Northern Animals,"" Copyright 1909 by E.T. Seton] At present the mountain goat extends from north-western Montana to the head of Cook Inlet, but it is not found in the interior or in the Yukon valley. Whenever man decides that the species has lived long enough, he can quickly and easily exterminate it. It is one of the most picturesque and interesting wild animals on this continent, and there is not the slightest excuse for shooting it, save as a specimen of natural history. Like the antelope, it is so unique as a natural curiosity that it deserves to be taken out of the ranks of animals that are regularly pursued as game. THE ELK.--The story of the progressive extermination of the American elk, or wapiti, covers practically the same territory as the tragedy of the American bison--one-third of the mainland of North America. The former range of the elk covered absolutely the garden ground of our continent, omitting the arid region. Its boundary extended from central Massachusetts to northern Georgia, southern Illinois, northern Texas and central New Mexico, central Arizona, the whole Rocky Mountain region up to the Peace River, and Manitoba. It skipped the arid country west of the Rockies, but it embraced practically the whole Pacific slope from central California to the north end of Vancouver Island. Mr. Seton roughly calculated the former range of _canadensis_ at two and a half million square miles, and adds: ""We are safe, therefore, in believing that in those days there may have been ten million head."" The range of the elk covered a magnificent domain. The map prepared by Mr. Ernest T. Seton, after twenty years of research, is the last word on the subject. It appears on page 43, Vol. I, of his great work, ""Life Histories of Northern Animals,"" and I have the permission of author and publisher to reproduce it here, as an object lesson in wild-animal extermination. Mr. Seton recognizes (for convenience, only?) four forms of American elk, two of which, _C. nannodes_ and _occidentalis_, still exist on the Pacific Coast. The fourth, _Cervus merriami_, was undoubtedly a valid species. It lived in Arizona and New Mexico, but became totally extinct near the beginning of the present century. In 1909 Mr. Seton published in the work referred to above a remarkably close estimate of the number of elk then alive in North America. Recently, a rough count--the first ever made--of the elk in and around the Yellowstone Park, revealed the real number of that largest contingent. By taking those results, and Mr. Seton's figures for elk outside the United States, we obtain the following very close approximation of the wild elk alive in North America in 1912: LOCALITY NUMBER AUTHORITY Yellowstone Park and vicinity 47,000 U.S. Biological Survey. Idaho (permanently), 600 Washington 1,200 Game Warden Chris. Morgenroth. Oregon 500 California 400 New York, Adirondacks 400 State Conservation Commission. Minnesota 50 E.T. Seton. Vancouver Island 2,000 E.T. Seton. British Columbia (S.-E.) 200 E.T. Seton. Alberta 1,000 E.T. Seton. Saskatchewan 500 E.T. Seton In various Parks and Zoos 1,000 E.T. Seton. ------ Total, for all America. 54,850 In 1905, a herd of twenty of the so-called dwarf elk of the San Joaquin Valley, California, were taken to the Sequoia National Park, and placed in a fenced range that had been established for it on the Kaweah River. The extermination of the wapiti began with the settlement of the American colonies. Naturally, the largest animals were the ones most eagerly sought by the meat-hungry pioneers, and the elk and bison were the first game species to disappear. The colonists believed in the survival of the fittest, and we are glad that they did. The one thing that a hungry pioneer cannot withstand is--temptation--in a form that embraces five hundred pounds of succulent flesh. And let it not be supposed that in the eastern states there were only a few elk. The Pennsylvania salt licks were crowded with them, and the early writers describe them as existing in ""immense bands"" and ""great numbers."" Of course it is impossible for wild animals of great size to exist in countries that are covered with farms, villages and people. Under such conditions the wild and the tame cannot harmonize. It is a fact, however, that elk could exist and thrive in every national forest and national park in our country, and also on uncountable hundreds of thousands of rough, wild, timbered hills and mountains such as exist in probably twenty-five different states. There is no reason, except man's short-sighted greed and foolishness, why there are not to-day one hundred thousand elk living in the Allegheny Mountains, furnishing each year fifty thousand three-year-old males as free food for the people. The trouble is,--the greedy habitants _could not_ be induced to kill only the three-year-old-males, in the fall, and let the cows, calves and breeding bulls alone! By sensible management the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Range would support enough wild elk to feed a million people. But we Americans seem utterly incapable of maintaining anywhere from decade to decade a large and really valuable supply of wild game. Outside the Yellowstone Park and northwestern Wyoming, the American elk exists only in small bands--mere remnants and samples of the millions we could and should have. _If_ they could be protected, and the surplus presently killed according to some rational, working system, then _every national forest in the United States should be stocked with elk_! In view of the awful cost of beef (to-day 10-1/2 cents per pound in Chicago _on the hoof_!), it is high time that we should consider the raising of game on the public domain on such lines that it would form a valuable food supply without diminishing the value of the forests. Just now (1912) the American people are sorely puzzled by a remarkable elk problem that each winter is presented for solution in the Jackson Hole country, Wyoming. Driven southward by the deep snows of winter, the elk thousands that in summer graze and grow fat in the Yellowstone Park march down into Jackson Hole, to find in those valleys less snow and more food. Now, it happens that the best and most of the former winter grazing grounds of the elk are covered by fenced ranches! As a result, the elk that strive to winter there, about fifteen thousand head, are each winter threatened with starvation; and during three or four winters of recent date, an aggregate of several thousand calves, weak yearlings and weakened cows perished of hunger. The winters of 1908, 1909 and 1910 were progressively more and more severe; and 1911 saw about 2500 deaths, (S.N. Leek). In 1909-10, the State of Wyoming spent $7,000 for hay, and fed it to the starving elk. In 1911, Wyoming spent $5,000 more, and appealed to Congress for help. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Lodge and others, Congress instantly responded with a splendid emergency appropriation of $20,000, partly for the purpose of feeding the elk, and also to meet the cost of transporting elsewhere as many of the elk as it might seem best to move. The starving of the elk ceased with 1911. _Outdoor Life_ magazine (Denver, Colo.) for August, 1912, contains an excellent article by Dr. W.B. Shore, entitled, ""Trapping and Shipping Elk."" I wish I could reprint it entire, for the solid information that it contains. It gives a clear and comprehensive account of last spring's operations by the Government and by the state of Montana in capturing and shipping elk from the Yellowstone Park herd, for the double purpose of diminishing the elk surplus in the Park and stocking vacant ranges elsewhere. The operations were conducted on the same basis as the shipping of cattle--the corral, the chute, the open car, and the car-load in bulk. Dr. Shore states that the undertaking was really no more difficult than the shipping of range cattle; but the presence of a considerable proportion of young and tender calves, such as are never handled with beef cattle, led to 8.8 per cent of deaths in transit. The deaths and the percentage are nothing at which to be surprised, when it is remembered, that the animals had just come through a hard winter, and their natural vitality was at the lowest point of the year. The following is a condensed summary of the results of the work: Number of Hours on Killed or Died After Destination Elk Road Died in Car Unloading 1 Car. Startup, Washington 60: calves, 94 11 7 yearlings and two-year olds 1 "" Hamilton, Montana 43: cows & 30 4 1 calves 1 "" Thompson Falls, Montana 40 -- 2 O 1 "" Stephensville, Montana 36 -- 1 1 1 "" Deer Lodge, Montana 40 24 2 O 1 "" Hamilton, Montana 40 -- O O 1 "" Mt. Vernon, Washington 46 4 days; 7 O unloaded & fed twice --- -- - 305 27 9 The total deaths in transit and after, of 36 elk out of 305, amounted to 11.4 per cent. All those shipped to Montana points were shipped by the state of Montana. In order to provide adequate winter grazing grounds for the Yellowstone-Wyoming elk, it seems imperative that the national government should expend between $30,000 and $40,000 in buying back from ranchmen certain areas in the Jackson valley, particularly a tract known as ""the swamp,"" and others on the surrounding foothills where the herds annually go to graze in winter, A measure to render this possible was presented to Congress in the winter of 1912, and without opposition an appropriation of $45,000 was made. The splendid photographs of the elk herds that recently have been made by S.N. Leek, of Jackson Hole, clearly reveal the fact that the herds now consist chiefly of cows, calves, yearlings and young bulls with small antlers. In one photograph showing about twenty-five hundred elk, there are not visible even half a dozen pairs of antlers that belong to adult bulls. There should be a hundred! This condition means that the best bulls, with the finest heads, are constantly being selected and killed by sportsmen and others who want their heads; and the young, immature bulls are left to do the breeding that alone will sustain the species. [Illustration: HUNGRY ELK IN JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING Part of a Herd of About 2,500 Head, being fed on hay, in the Winter of 1910-11 Note the Absence of Adult Bulls. Copyright, 1911, by S.N. Leek] It is a well-known principle in stock-breeding that sires should be fully adult, of maximum strength, and in the prime of life. No stockbreeder in his senses ever thinks of breeding from a youthful, immature sire. The result would be weak offspring not up to the standard. This inexorable law of inheritance and transmission is just as much a law for the elk, moose and deer of North America as it is for domestic cattle and horses. If the present conditions in the Wyoming elk herds continue to prevail for several generations, as sure as time goes on we shall see a marked deterioration in the size and antlers of the elk. If the foundation principles of stock-breeding are correct, then it is impossible to maintain any large-mammal species at its zenith of size, strength and virility by continuous breeding of the young and immature males. By some sportsmen it is believed that through long-continued killing of the finest and largest males, the red deer of Europe have been growing smaller; but on that point I am not prepared to offer evidence. In regard to the in-breeding of the elk herds in large open parks and preserves throughout North America, there are positively _no ill effects to fear_. Wild animals that are _closely_ confined generation after generation are bound to deteriorate physically; but with healthy wild animals living in large open ranges, feeding and breeding naturally, the in-breeding that occurs produces no deterioration. In the twin certainties of over-population, and deterioration from excessive killing of the good sires, we have to face two new problems of very decided importance. Nothing short of very radical measures will provide a remedy. For the immediate future, I can offer a solution. While it seems almost impossible deliberately to kill females, I think that the present is a very exceptional case, and one that compels us to apply the painful remedy that I now propose. _Premises_: 1.--There are at present _too many_ breeding cows in the Yellowstone herds. 2.--There are far too few good breeding bulls. _Conclusion_:--For five years, entirely prohibit the killing of adult male elk, and kill only females, and young males. This would gradually diminish the number of calves born each year, by about 2,500, and by the end of five years it would reduce the number, _and the annual birth_, of females to a figure sufficiently limited that the herds could be maintained on existing ranges. _Corollary_.--At the end of five years, stop killing females, and kill only _young_ males. This plan would permit a large number of bull elk to mature; and then the largest and strongest animals would do the breeding,--just as Nature always intends shall be done. * * * * * SOUTH AMERICA Of all the big-game regions of the earth, South America is the poorest. Of hoofed game she possesses only a dozen species that are worth the attention of sportsmen; and like all other animal life in that land of little game, they are desperately hard to find. In South America you must work your heart out in order to get either game or specimens that will be worth showing. At present, we need not worry about the marsh deer, the pampas deer, the guemal, or the venado, nor the tapir, jaguar, ocelot and bears. All these species are abundantly able to take care of themselves; and to find and kill any one of them is a man's task. In Patagonia the natives do wastefully slaughter the guanacos; and there are times also when great numbers of guanacos come down in winter to certain mountain lakes, presumably in search of food, and perish by hundreds through starvation. (H. Hesketh Prichard.) * * * * * MEXICO About ten years more will see the extinction of the mountain sheep of Lower California,--in the wake of the recently exterminated Mexican sheep of the Santa Maria Lakes region. In 1908, I solemnly warned the government of President Diaz, and at that time the Mexican government expressed much concern. It is a great pity that just now political conditions are completely estopping wild-life protection in Mexico; but it is true. If the code of proposed laws that I drew up (by request) in 1908 and submitted to Minister Molina were adopted, it would have a good effect on the fauna of Mexico. In Mexico there is little hoofed game to kill,--deer of the white-tail groups, seven or eight species; the desert mule deer; the brocket; the prong-horned antelope, the mountain sheep and the peccary. The deer will not so easily be exterminated, but the antelope and sheep will be utterly destroyed. They will be the first to go; and I think they can not by any possibility last longer than ten years. Is it not too bad that Mexico should permit her finest species of hoofed and horned game to be obliterated before she awakens to the desirability of conservation! The Mexicans could protect their small stock of big game if they would; but in Lower California they are leasing huge tracts of land to cattle companies, and they permit the lessees to kill all the wild game they please on their leased lands, even with the aid of dogs. This is a vicious and fatal system, and contrary to all the laws of nations. * * * * * CHAPTER XVII PRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAME (Concluded) THE WHITE-TAILED DEER.--Five hundred years hence, when the greed and rapacity of ""civilized"" man has completed the loot and ruin of the continent of North America, the white-tailed deer will be the last species of our big game to be exterminated. Its mental traits, its size, its color and its habits all combine to render it the most persistent of our large animals, and the best fitted to survive. It neither bawls nor bugles to attract its enemies, it can not be called to a sportsman, like the moose, and it sticks to its timber with rare and commendable closeness. When it sees a strange living thing walking erect, it does not stop to stare and catch soft-nosed bullets, but dashes away in quest of solitude. The worst shooting that I ever did or saw done at game was at running white-tailed deer, in the Montana river bottoms. For the reasons given, the white-tail exists and persists in a hundred United States localities from which all other big game save the black bear have been exterminated. For example, in our Adirondacks the moose were exterminated years and years ago, but the beloved wilderness called the ""North Woods"" still is populated by about 20,000 deer, and about 8,000 are killed annually. The deer of Maine are sufficiently numerous that in 1909 a total of 15,879 were killed. With some assistance from the thin sprinkling of moose and caribou, the deer of Maine annually draw into that state, for permanent dedication, a huge sum of money, variously estimated at from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. In spite of heavy slaughter, and vigorous attempts at extermination by over-shooting, the deer of northern Michigan obstinately refuse to be wiped out. There is, however, a large group of states in which this species has been exterminated. The states comprising it are Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and adjacent portions of seven other states. As if to shame the people of Iowa, a curious deer episode is recorded. In 1885, W.B. Cuppy, of Avoca, Iowa, purchased five deer, and placed them in a paddock on his 600-acre farm. By 1900 they had increased to 32 head; and then one night some one kindly opened the gate of their enclosure, and gave them the freedom of the city. Mr. Cuppy made no effort to capture them, possibly because they decided to annex his farm as their habitat. When a neighbor led them with a bait of corn to their owner's door, he declined to impound them, on the ground that it was unnecessary. By 1912, those deer had increased to 400, and the portion of this story that no one will believe is this: they spread all through the suburbs and hinterland farms of Avoca, and _the people not only failed to assassinate all of them and eat them, but they actually killed only a few, protected the rest, and made pets of many!_ Queer people, those men and boys of Avoca. Nearly everywhere else in the world that I know, that history would have been ended differently. Here in the East, 90 per cent of our people are like the Avocans, but the other 10 per cent think only of slaying and eating, sans mercy, sans decency, sans law. Now the State of Iowa has taken hold, to capture some of those deer, and set them free in other portions of the state. Elsewhere I shall note the quick and thorough success with which the white-tailed deer has been brought back in Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and southern New York. No state having waste lands covered with brush or timber need be without the ubiquitous white-tailed deer. Give them a semblance of a fair show, and they will live and breed with surprising fecundity and persistence. If you start a park herd with ten does, soon you will have more deer than you will know how to dispose of, unless you market them under a Bayne law, duly tagged by the state. In close confinement this species fares rather poorly. In large preserves it does well, but during the rutting season the bucks are to be dreaded; and those that develop aggressive traits should be shot and marketed. This is the only way in which the deer parks of England are kept safe for unarmed people. Dr. T.S. Palmer has taken much pains to ascertain the number of deer killed in the eastern United States. His records, as published in May, 1910, are as follows: STATE 1908 1909 1910 Maine 15,000 15,879 15,000 New Hampshire (a) (a) (a) Vermont 2,700 4,736 3,649 New York 6,000 9,000 9,000 New Jersey (a) 120 Pennsylvania 500 500 800 Michigan 9,076 6,641 13,347 Wisconsin 11,000 6,000 6,000 Minnesota 6,000 6,000 3,147 West Virginia 107 51 49 Maryland 16 13 6 Virginia 207 210 224 North Carolina (a) (a) (a) South Carolina 1,000 (a) (a) Georgia (a) 367 369 Florida 2,209 2,021 1,526 Alabama 152 148 132 Mississippi 411 458 500 Louisiana 5,500 5,470 5,000 Massachusetts 1,281 ------ ------ ------ Total 59,878 57,494 60,150 (a) No statistics available. At this date deer hunting is not permitted at any time in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas,--where there are no wild deer; nor in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Tennessee or Kentucky. The long close seasons in Massachusetts, Connecticut and southern New York have caused a great migration of deer into those once-depopulated regions,--in fact, right down to tide-water. THE MULE DEER.--This will be the first member of the Deer Family to become extinct in North America outside of the protected portions of its haunts. Its fatal preference for open ground and its habit of pausing to stare at the hunter have been, and to the end will be, its undoing. Possibly there are now two of these deer in the United States and British Columbia for every 98 that existed forty years ago, but no more. It is a deer of the bad lands and foothills, and its curiosity is fatal. The number of sportsmen who have hunted and killed this fine animal in its own wild and picturesque bad-lands is indeed quite small. It has been four-fifths exterminated by the resident hunter and ranchman, and to-day is found in the Rocky Mountain region most sparingly. Ten years ago it seemed right to hunt the so-called Rocky Mountain ""black-tail"" in northwestern Montana, because so many deer were there it did not seem to spell extermination. Now, conditions have changed. Since last winter's great slaughter in northwestern Montana, of 11,000 hungry deer, the species has been so reduced that it is no longer right to kill mule deer anywhere in our country, and a universal close season for five years is the duty of every state which contains that species. THE REAL BLACK-TAILED DEER, of the Pacific coast, (_Odocoileus columbianus_) is, to most sportsmen of the Rocky Mountains and the East actually less known than the okapi! Not one out of every hundred of them can recognize a mounted head of it at sight. It is a small, delicately-formed, delicately-antlered understudy of the big mule deer, and now painfully limited in its distribution. It is _the_ deer of California and western Oregon, and it has been so ruthlessly slaughtered that today it is going fast. As conditions stand to-day, and without a radical change on the part of the people of the Pacific coast, this very interesting species is bound to disappear. It will not be persistent, like the white-tailed deer, but in the heavy forests, it will last much longer than the mule deer. My information regarding this deer is like the stock of specimens of it in museum collections,--meager and unsatisfactory. We need to know in detail how that species is faring to-day, and what its prospects are for the immediate future. In 1900, I saw great piles of skins from it in the fur houses of Seattle, and the sight gave me much concern. THE CARIBOU, GENERALLY.--I think it is not very difficult to forecast the future of the Genus _Rangifer_ in North America, from the logic of the conditions of to-day. Thanks to the splendid mass of information that has been accumulated regarding this group, we are able to draw certain conclusions. I think that the caribou of the Canadian Barren Grounds and northeastern Alaska will survive in great numbers for at least another century; that the caribou herds of Newfoundland will last nearly as long, and that in fifty years or less all the caribou of the great northwestern wilderness will be swept away. The reasons for these conclusions are by no means obscure, or farfetched. In the first place, the barren-ground caribou are to-day enormously numerous,--undoubtedly running up into millions. It can not be possible that they are being killed faster than they are breeding; and so they must be increasing. Their food supply is unlimited. They are protected by two redoubtable champions,--Jack Frost and the Mosquito. Their country never will contain a great human population. The natives are so few in number, and so lazy, that even though they should become supplied with modern firearms, it is unlikely that they ever will make a serious impression on the caribou millions. The only thing to fear for the barren-ground caribou throngs is disease,--a factor that is beyond human prediction. It is reasonably certain that the Barren Grounds never will be netted by railways,--unless gold is discovered over a wide area. The fierce cold and hunger, and the billions of mosquitoes of the Barren Grounds will protect the caribou from the wholesale slaughter that ""civilized"" man joyously would inflict--if he had the chance. The caribou thousands of Newfoundland are fairly accessible to sportsmen and pot-hunters, but at the same time the colonial government can protect them from extermination if it will. Already much has been done to check the reckless and wicked slaughter that once prevailed. A bag limit of three bull caribou per annum has been fixed, which is enforced as to non-residents and sportsmen, but in a way that is much too ""American"" it is often ignored by residents in touch with the game. For instance, the guide of a New York gentleman whom I know admitted to my friend that each year he killed ""about 25"" caribou for himself and his family of four other persons. He explained thus: ""When the inspector comes around, I show him two caribou hanging in my woodshed, but back in the woods I have a little shack where I keep the others until I want them."" The real sportsmen of the world never will make the slightest perceptible impression on the caribou of Newfoundland. For one thing, the hunting is much too tame to be interesting. If the caribou of that Island ever are exterminated, it will be strictly by the people of Newfoundland, themselves. If the government will tighten its grip on the herds, they need never be exterminated. The caribou of New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario are few and widely scattered. Unless carefully conserved, they are not likely to last long; for their country is annually penetrated in every direction by armed men, white and red. There is no means by which it can be proven, but from the number of armed men in those regions I feel sure that the typical woodland caribou species is being shot faster than it is breeding. The sportsmen and naturalists of Canada and New Brunswick would render good service by making a close and careful investigation of that question. The caribou of the northwestern wilderness are in a situation peculiarly their own. They inhabit a region of naked mountains and _thin_ forests, wherein they are conspicuous, easily stalked and easily killed. Nowhere do they exist in large herds of thousands, or even of many hundreds. They live in small bands of from ten to twenty head, and even those are far apart. The region in which they live is certain to be thoroughly opened up by railways, and exploited. Fifty years from now we will find every portion of the now-wild Northwest fairly accessible by rail. The building of the railways will be to the caribou--and to other big game--the day of doom. In that wild, rough region, no power on earth,--save that which might be able to deprive _all_ the inhabitants and all visitors of firearms,--can possibly save the game outside of a few preserves that are diligently patroled. The big game of the northwest region, in which I include the interior of Alaska, _will go_! It is only a question of time. Already the building of the city of Fairbanks, and the exploitation of the mining districts surrounding it, have led to such harassment and slaughter of the migrating caribou that the great herd which formerly traversed the Tanana country once a year has completely changed its migration route, and now keeps much farther north. The ""crossing"" of the Yukon near Eagle City has been abandoned. A hundred years hence, the northwestern wilderness will be dotted with towns and criss-crossed with railways; but the big game of it will be gone, except in the preserves that are yet to be made. This will particularly involve the caribou, moose, and mountain sheep of all species, which will be the first to go. The mountain goat and the forest bears will hold out longer than their more exposed neighbors of the treeless mountains. THE MOOSE.--In the United States the moose is found in five states,--Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. There are 550 in the Yellowstone Park. In Maine and Minnesota only may moose be hunted and killed. In the season of 1909, 184 moose were killed in Maine,--a large number, considering the small moose population of that state. In northern Minnesota, we now possess a great national moose preserve of 909,743 acres; and in 1908 Mr. Fullerton, after a personal inspection in which he saw 189 moose in nine days, estimated the total moose population of the present day at 10,000 head. This is a moose preserve worth while. Outside of protected areas, the moose is the animal that is most easily exterminated. Its trail is easily followed, and its habits are thoroughly known, down to three decimal places. As a hunter's reward it is Great. Strange to say, New Brunswick has found that the moose is an animal that it is possible, and even easy, to protect. The death of a moose is an event that is not easily concealed! Wherever it is thoroughly understood that the moose law will be enforced, the would-be poacher pauses to consider the net results to him of a jail sentence. In New Brunswick we have seen two strange things happen, during our own times. We have seen the moose migrate into, and permanently occupy, an extensive area that previously was destitute of that species. At the same time, we have seen a reasonable number of bull moose killed by sportsmen without disturbing in the least the general equanimity of the general moose population! And at this moment, the moose population of New Brunswick is almost incredible. Every moose hunter who goes there sees from 20 to 40 moose, and two of my friends last year saw, ""in round numbers, about 100!"" Up to date the size of adult antlers seem to be maintaining a high standard. In summer, the photographing of moose in the rivers, lakes and ponds of Maine and New Brunswick amounts to an industry. I am uneasy about the constant picking off of the largest and best breeding bulls of the Mirimachi country, lest it finally reduce the size and antlers of the moose of that region; but only the future can tell us just how that prospect stands to-day. In Alaska, our ever thoughtful and forehanded Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has by legal proclamation at one stroke converted the whole of the Kenai Peninsula into a magnificent moose preserve. This will save _Alces gigas_, the giant moose of Alaska, from extermination; and New Brunswick and the Minnesota preserve will save _Alces americanus_. But in the northwest, we can positively depend upon it that eventually, wherever the moose may legally be hunted and killed by any Tom, Dick or Harry who can afford a twenty-dollar rifle and a license, the moose surely will disappear. The moose laws of Alaska are strict--toward sportsmen, only! The miners, ""prospectors"" and Indians may kill as many as they please, ""for food purposes."" This opens the door to a great amount of unfair slaughter. Any coffee-cooler can put a pan and pick into his hunting outfit, go out after moose, and call himself a ""prospector."" I grant that the _real_ prospector, who is looking for ores and minerals with an intelligent eye, and knows what he is doing, should have special privileges on game, to keep him from starving. The settled miner, however, is in a different class. No miner should ask the privilege of living on wild game, any more than should the farmer, the steamboat man, the railway laborer, or the soldier in an army post. The Indian should have no game advantages whatever over a white man. He does not own the game of a region, any more than he owns its minerals or its water-power. He should obey the general game laws, just the same as white men. In Africa, as far as possible, the white population wisely prohibits the natives from owning or using firearms, and a good idea it is, too. I am glad there is one continent on which the ""I'm-just-as-good-as-you-are"" nightmare does not curse the whole land. THE MUSK-OX.--Now that the north pole has been safely discovered, and the south pole has become the storm-center of polar exploration, the harried musk-ox herds of the farthest north are having a rest. I think that most American sportsmen have learned that as a sporting proposition there is about as much fun and glory in harrying a musk-ox herd with dogs, and picking off the members of it at ""parade rest,"" as there is in shooting range cattle in a round-up. The habits of the animal positively eliminate the real essence of sport,--difficulty and danger. When a musk-ox band is chased by dogs, or by wolves, the full-grown members of it, bulls and cows alike, instantly form a close circle around the calves, facing outward shoulder to shoulder, and stand at bay. Without the aid of a gunner and a rifle, such a formation is invincible! Mr. Paul Rainey's moving pictures tell a wonderful story of animal intelligence, bravery and devotion to the parental instinct. For some reason, the musk-ox herds do not seem to have perceptibly increased since man first encountered them. The number alive to-day appears to be no greater than it was fifty years ago; and this leads to the conclusion that the present delicate balance could easily be disturbed the wrong way. Fortunately, it seems reasonably certain that the Indians of the Canadian Barren Grounds, the Eskimo of the far north, and the stray explorers all live outside the haunts of the species, and come in touch only with the edge of the musk-ox population as a whole. This leads us to hope and believe that, through the difficulties involved in reaching them, the main bodies of musk-ox of both species are safe from extermination. At the same time, the time has come for Canada, the United States and Denmark to join in formulating a stiff law for the prevention of wholesale slaughter of musk-ox for sport. It should be rendered impossible for another sportsman to kill twenty-three head in one day, as once occurred. Give the sportsman a bag of three bulls, and no more. To this, no true sportsman will object, and the objections of game-hogs only serve to confirm the justice of the thing they oppose. THE GRIZZLY BEAR.--To many persons it may seem strange that anyone should feel disposed to accord protection to such fierce predatory animals as grizzly bears, lions and tigers. But the spirit of fair play springs eternal in some human breasts. The sportsmen of the world do not stick at using long-range, high-power repeating rifles on big game, but they draw the line this side of traps, poisons and extermination. The sportsmen of India once thought,--for about a year and a day,--that it was permissible to kill troublesome and expensive tigers by poison. Mr. G.P. Sanderson tried it, and when his strychnine operations promptly developed three bloated and disgusting tiger carcasses, even his native followers revolted at the principle. That was the alpha and omega of Sanderson's poisoning activities. I am quite sure that if the extermination of the tiger from the whole of India were possible, and the to-be or not-to-be were put to a vote of the sportsmen of India, the answer would be a thundering _""No!""_ Says Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton in his ""Animal Life in Africa:"" ""It is impossible to contemplate the use against the lion of any other weapon than the rifle."" The real sportsmen and naturalists of America are decidedly opposed to the extermination of the grizzly bear. They feel that the wilds of North America are wide enough for the accommodation of many grizzlies, without crowding the proletariat. A Rocky Mountain without a grizzly upon it, or at least a bear of some kind, is only half a mountain,--commonplace and tame. Put one two-year-old grizzly cub upon it, and presto! every cubic yard of its local atmosphere reeks with romantic uncertainty and fearsome thrills. A few persons have done considerable talking and writing about the damage to stock inflicted by bears, but I think there is little justification for such charges. Certainly, there is not one-tenth enough real damage done by bears to justify their extermination. At the present time, we hear that the farmers (!) of Kadiak Island, Alaska, are being seriously harassed and damaged by the big Kadiak bear,--an animal so rare and shy that it is very difficult for a sportsman to kill one! I think the charges against the bears,--if the Kadiak Islanders ever really have made any,--need to be proven, by the production of real evidence. In the United States, outside of our game preserves, I know of not one locality in which grizzly bears are sufficiently numerous to justify a sportsman in going out to hunt them. The California grizzly, once represented by ""Monarch"" in Golden Gate Park, is almost, if not wholly, extinct. In Montana, outside of Glacier Park it is useless to apply for wild grizzlies. In the Bitter Root Mountains and Clearwater Mountains of Idaho, there are grizzlies, but they hide so effectually under the snow-bent willows on the ""slides"" that it is almost impossible to get a shot. Northwestern Wyoming still contains a few grizzlies, but there are so many square miles of mountains around each animal it is now almost useless to go hunting for them. British Columbia, western Alberta and the coast mountains at least as far as Skaguay, and Yukon Territory generally, all contain grizzlies, and the sportsman who goes out for sheep, caribou and moose is reasonably certain to see half a dozen bears and kill at least one or two. In those countries, the grizzly species will hold forth long after all killable grizzlies have vanished from the United States. I think that it is now time for California, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming to give grizzly bears protection of some sort. Possibly the situation in those states calls for a five-year close season. Even British Columbia should now place a bag limit on this species. This has seemed clear to me ever since two of my friends killed (in the spring of 1912) _six_ grizzlies in one week! But Provincial Game Warden A. Bryan Williams says that at present it would be impossible to impose a bag limit of one per year on the grizzlies of British Columbia; and Mr. Williams is a sincere game-protector. THE BROWN BEARS OF ALASKA.--These magnificent monsters present a perplexing problem, which I am inclined to believe can be satisfactorily solved by the Biological Survey only in short periods, say of three or four years each. Naturally, the skin hunters of Alaska ardently desire the skins of those bears, for the money they represent. That side of the bear problem does not in the least appeal to the ninety odd millions of people who live this side of Alaska. The skins of the Alaskan brown bears have little value save as curiosities, nailed upon the wall, where they can not be stepped upon and injured. The _hunting_ of those bears, however, is a business for men; and it is partly for that reason they should be preserved. A bear-hunt on the Alaska Peninsula, Admiralty or Montagu Islands, is an event of a lifetime, and with a bag limit of _one_ brown bear, the species would be quite safe from extermination. [Illustration: THE WICHITA NATIONAL BISON HERD Presented by the New York Zoological Society] In Alaska there is some dissatisfaction over the protection accorded the big brown bears; but those rules are right _as far as they go_! A governor of Alaska once said to me: ""The preservation of the game of Alaska should be left to the _people_ of Alaska. It is their game; and they will preserve it all right!"" The answer? _Not by a long shot_! Only three things were wrong with the ex-governor's view: 1.--The game of Alaska does _not_ belong to the people who live in Alaska--with the intent to get out to-morrow! It belongs to the 93,000,000 people of the Nation. 2.--The preservation of the Alaskan fauna on the public domain should not be left unreservedly to the people of Alaska, because 3.--As sure as shooting, they will _not_ preserve it! Congress is right in appropriating $15,000 for game protection in Alaska. It is very necessary that the regulations for conserving the wild life should be fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture, with the advice of the Biological Survey. THE BLACK BEAR is an interesting citizen. He harms nobody nor anything; he affords good sport; he objects to being exterminated, and wherever in North America he is threatened with extermination, he should at once be given protection! A black bear _in the wilds_ is harmless. In captivity, posed as a household ""pet,"" he is decidedly dangerous, and had best be given the middle of the road. In big forests he is a grand stayer, and will not be exterminated from the fauna of the United States until Washington is wrecked by anarchists. THE AMERICAN BISON.--I regard the American bison species as now reasonably secure against extermination. This is due to the fact that it breeds persistently and successfully in captivity, and to the great efforts that have been put forth by the United States Government, the Canadian Government, the American Bison Society, the New York Zoological Society, and several private individuals. The species reached its lowest ebb in 1889, when there were only 256 head in captivity and 835 running wild. The increase has been as follows: 1888--W.T. Hornaday's census 1,300 1902--S.P. Langley's census 1,394 1905--Frank Baker's census 1,697 1908--W.T. Hornaday's census 2,047 1910--W.P. Wharton's census (in North America) 2,108 1912--W.P. Wharton's census (in North America) 2,907 To-day, nearly one-half of the living bison are in very large governmental parks, perpetually established and breeding rapidly, as follows: IN THE UNITED STATES. Yellowstone Park fenced herd, founded by Congress 125 Montana National Bison Range, founded by The American Bison Society 69 Wichita Bison Range, founded by The New York Zoological Society 39 Wind Cave Bison Range, S. Dakota, founded by Am. Bison Society To be stocked Niobrara (Neb.) National Bison Range, now in process of creation To be stocked IN CANADA. Buffalo Park, Wainwright, Alberta 1,052 Elk Island Park, Alberta 53 Rocky Mountains Park, Banff, Alberta 27 Total National and Provincial Preserves 1,365 Of wild bison there are only three groups: 49 head in the Yellowstone National Park, about 75 Pablo ""outlaws"" around the Montana Bison Range, and between 300 and 400 head in northern Athabasca, southwest of Fort Resolution, existing in small and widely scattered bands. The efforts of man to atone for the great bison slaughter by preserving the species from extinction have been crowned with success. Two governments and two thousand individuals have shared this task,--solely for sentimental reasons. In these facts we find reason to hope and believe that other efforts now being made to save other species from annihilation will be equally successful. * * * * * CHAPTER XVIII THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF AFRICAN GAME Thanks to the diligence with which sportsmen and field naturalists have recorded their observations in the haunts of big game, it is not at all difficult to forecast the immediate future of the big game of the world. We may safely assume that all lands well suited to agriculture, mining and grazing will become populated by rifle-bearing men, with the usual result to the wild mammals and birds. At the same time, the game of the open mountains everywhere is thinly distributed and easily exterminated. On the other hand, the unconquerable forest jungles of certain portions of the tropics will hold their own, and shelter their four-footed inhabitants for centuries to come. On the open mountains of the world and on the grazing lands most big game is now being killed much faster than it breeds. This is due to the attacks of five times too many hunters, open seasons that are too long, and bag limits that are far too liberal. As an example, consider Africa Viewed in any way it may be taken, the bag limit in British East Africa is appallingly high. Notice this astounding array of wild creatures that _each hunter_ may kill under a license costing _only $250!_ 2 Buffalo 2 Rhinoceros 2 Hippopotamus 1 Eland 2 Grevy Zebra 20 Common Zebra 2 Fringe-eared Oryx 4 Beisa Antelope 4 Waterbuck 1 Sable Antelope 1 Roan Antelope 1 Greater Kudu 4 Lesser Kudu 10 Topi 20 Coke Hartebeest 2 Neumann Hartebeest 4 Jackson Hartebeest 6 Hunter's Antelope 4 Thomas Kob 2 Bongo 4 Pallah 2 Sitatunga 3 Gnu 12 Grant Gazelle 4 Waller's Gazelle 10 Harvey's Duiker 10 Isaac's Duiker 10 Blue Duiker 10 Kirk's Dik-dik 10 Guenther's Dik-dik 10 Hinde's Dik-dik 10 Cavendish Dik-dik 10 Abyssinian Oribi 10 Haggard's Oribi 10 Kenya Oribi 10 Suni 10 Klipspringer 10 Ward's Reedbuck 10 Chanler's Reedbuck 10 Thompson Gazelle 10 Peters Gazelle 10 Soemmerring Gazelle 10 Bushbuck 10 Haywood Bushbuck The grand total is a possible 300 large hoofed and horned animals representing _44 species_! Add to this all the lions, leopards, cheetahs, cape hunting dogs and hyaenas that the hunter can kill, and it will be enough to stock a zoological garden! Quite a number of these species, like the sable antelope, kudu, Hunter's antelope, bongo and sitatunga are already rare, and therefore they are all the more eagerly sought. Into the fine grass-lands of British East Africa, suitable for crops and stock grazing, settlers are steadily going. Each one is armed, and at once becomes a killer of big game. And all the time the visiting sportsmen are increasing in number, going farther from the Uganda Railway, and persistently seeking out the rarest and finest of the game. The buffalo has recovered from the slaughter by rinderpest only in time to meet the onset of oversea sportsmen. Mr. Arthur Jordan has seen much of the big game of British East Africa, and its killing. Him I asked to tell me how long, in his opinion, the big game of that territory will last outside of the game preserves, as it is now being killed. He said, ""Oh, it will last a long time. I think it will last fifteen years!"" _Fifteen years!_ And this for the richest big-game fauna of any one spot in the whole world, which Nature has been _several million years in developing and placing there_! At present the marvelous herds of big game of British East Africa and Uganda constitute the grandest zoological spectacle that the world ever has seen in historic times. For such an area, the number of species is incredible, and until they are seen, the thronging masses of individuals are beyond conception. It is easy to say ""a herd of 3,000 zebras;"" but no mere words can give an adequate impression of the actual army of stripes and bars, and hoofs thundering in review over a grassy plain. But the settlers say, ""The zebras must go! They break through our best wire fences, ruin our crops, despoil us of the fruits of long and toilsome efforts, and much expenditure. We simply can not live in a country inhabited by herds of wild zebras."" And really, their contention is well founded. When it is necessary to choose between wild animals and peaceful agriculture for millions of men, the animals must give way. In those portions of the great East African plateau region that are suited to modern agriculture, stretching from Buluwayo to northern Uganda, the wild herds are doomed to be crowded out by the farmer and the fruit-grower. This is the inevitable result of civilization and progress in wild lands. Marauding battalions of zebras, bellicose rhinoceroses and murderous buffaloes do not fit in with ranches and crops, and children going to school. Except in the great game preserves, the swamps and the dense jungles it is certain that the big game of the whole of eastern Africa is foredoomed to disappear,--the largest and most valuable species first. Five hundred years from now, when North America is worn out, and wasted to a skeleton of what it now is, the great plateau region of East Africa between Cape Town and Lake Rudolph will be a mighty empire, teeming with white population. Giraffes and rhinoceroses now are trampling over the sites of the cities and universities of the future. Then the herds of grand game that now make Africa a sportsman's wonderland will exist only in closed territory, in books, and in memory. [Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LION Incidentally, it is also an Index of the Disappearance of African Big Game Generally. From an Article in the Review of Reviews, for August, 1912, by Cyrus C. Adams, and Based Largely upon the Exhaustive Studies of Dr. C.M. Engel, of Copenhagen.] From what has befallen in South Africa, we can easily and correctly forecast the future of the big game of British East Africa and Uganda. Less than fifty years ago, Cape Colony, Natal, Zululand, and every country up to the Zambesi was teeming with herds of big wild animals, just as the northern provinces now are. As late as 1890, when Rhodesia was taken over by the Chartered Company, and the capital city of Salisbury was staked out, an American boy in the Pioneer Corps, now Honorable William Harvey Brown, of Salisbury, wrote thus of the Gwibi Flats, near Salisbury: ""That evening I beheld on those flats a sight which probably will never again be seen there to the end of the world. The variety deploying before me was almost incredible! There, within the range of my vision were groups of roan, sable and tsessebi antelopes, Burchell zebras, [now totally extinct!] elands, reedbucks, steinbucks and ostriches. It was like Africa in the days of Livingstone. As I sat on my horse, viewing with amazement this wonderful panorama of wild life, I was startled by a herd that came galloping around a small hill just behind me.""--(""_On the South African Frontier_,"" p. 114.) That was in 1890. And how is it to-day? Salisbury is a modern city, endorsed by two lines of railway. The Gwibi Flats are farms. There is some big game yet, in Rhodesia south of the Zambesi, but to find it you must go at least a week's journey from the capital, to the remote corners that have not yet been converted into farms or mining settlements. North of the Zambesi, Rhodesia yet contains plenty of big game. The Victoria Falls station is a popular starting point for hunting expeditions headed northeast and northwest. In the northwest the game is yet quite in a state of nature. Unfortunately the Barotse natives of that region can procure from the Portuguese traders all the firearms and ammunition that they can pay for, and by treaty they retain their hunting rights. The final result will be--extermination of the game. Elsewhere throughout Rhodesia the natives are not permitted to have guns and gunpowder,--a very wise regulation. In Alaska our Indians are privileged to kill game all the year round, and they have modern firearms with which to do it. And how is it with the game of that day? The true Burchell's zebra is now regarded as _extinct_! In Cape Colony and Natal, that once teemed with big game in the old-fashioned African way, they are _counting the individual wild animals that remain_! Also, they are making game preserves, literally everywhere. Now that the best remaining game districts of Africa are rapidly coming under British control, it is a satisfaction to observe that the governing bodies and executive officers are alive to the necessity of preserving the big game from actual extinction. Excepting German East Africa, from Uganda to Cape Colony the game preserves form an almost continuous chain. It is quite impossible to enumerate all of them; but the two in British East Africa are of enormous size, and are well stocked with game. South Africa contains a great many smaller preserves and a few specimen herds of big game, but that is about all. Except in a few localities the hunting of big game in that region is done forever. The Western Districts Game and Trout Protective Association of South Africa recently, (1911), has made careful counts and estimates of the number of individual game animals remaining in Cape Colony, with the following result: * * * * * BIG GAME IN THE CAPE PROVINCE From information kindly placed at the disposal of the Association by the Government, it was found that the following varieties of big game are still found in the Province. The numbers, however, are only approximate: _Blesbok_: About 400 in Steynsburg, and 35 in Queen's Town divisions. _Bontebok_: About 30 in Bredasdorp and 45 in Swellendam divisions. _Buffalo_: About 340 in Uitenhage, 120 in Alexandria, and 75 in Bathurst divisions. _Elephants_: About 130 in Alexandria, 160 in Uitenhage, 40 in Bathurst, and 20 in Knysna divisions. _Gemsbok_: About 2,450 in Namaqualand, 4,500 in Vryburg, 4,000 in Gordonia, and 670 in the Kenhardt, Mafeking and Barkly West divisions. _Koodoo_: About 10,000, found chiefly in the divisions of Albany, Barkly West, Fort Beaufort, Hay, Herbert, Jansenville, Kuruman, Ladismith, Mafeking, Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn, Riversdale, Steytlerville, Uitenhage, Victoria East and Vryburg. _Oribi_: About 120, in the divisions of Albany and Alexandria. _Rietbok_: About 170, in the Komgha division. _Zebra_: About 560, most of which are to be found in the divisions of Cradock, George and Oudtshoorn. A few are to be found in the divisions of Uniondale and Uitenhage. _Springbok_: Being migratory, it is difficult to estimate their number. In some years they are compelled by drought to invade the Province in large numbers. They are then seen as far south as Calvinia and Fraserburg. Large numbers are, however, fenced in on private estates in various parts of the Province. _Klipspringers_: About 11,200, in the following divisions, viz.: Namaqualand, 6,559; Kuruman, 2,100; Steytlerville, 1,530; Oudtshoorn, 275; Hay, 250; Ladismith, 220; Graaff-Reinet, 119; Kenhardt, 66; and Cradock, 56. _Hartebeest_: About 9,700, principally in the divisions of Vryburg, Gordonia, Kuruman, Mafeking, Kimberley, Hay and Beaufort West. _Wildebeest_: About 3,450 in Vryburg, 80 each in Gordonia and Kuruman, 65 in Mafeking, 20 in Queen's Town, and a few in the Bredasdorp divisions. _Eland_: About 12 in the Graaff-Reinet division, privately bred. * * * * * The above showing of the pitifully small numbers of the specimens that constitute the remnant of the big-game of the Cape suggest just one thing:--a universal close season throughout Cape Colony, and no hunting whatever for ten years. And yet, what do we see? The Report from which the above census was taken contains half a column of solid matter, in small type, giving a list of the _open seasons_ all over Cape Colony, during which killing may be done! So it seems that the spirit of slaughter is the same in Africa that it is in America,--_kill_, as long as there is _anything_ alive to kill! This list is of startling interest, because it shows how closely the small remnants of big game are now marked down in South Africa. In view of the success with which Englishmen protect their game when once they have made up their minds to do so, it is fair to expect that the herds now under protection, as listed above, will save their respective species from extinction. It is alarming, however, to note the wide territory covered by the deadly ""open seasons,"" and to wonder when the bars really will be put up. To-day, Mashonaland is a very-much-settled colony. The Cape to Cairo railway and trains de luxe long ago attained the Palls of the Zambesi, and now the Curator of the Salisbury Museum will have to search diligently in far off Nyassaland, and beyond the Zambesi River, to find enough specimens to fill his cases with representatives of the vanished Rhodesian fauna. Once (1892) the white rhinoceros was found in northern Rhodesia; but never again. In Salisbury, elands and zebras are nearly as great a curiosity as they are in St. Louis. But for the discovery of white rhinoceroses in the Lado district, on the western bank of the Nile below Gondokoro, we would now be saying that _Rhinoceros simus_ is within about ten specimens of total extinction. From South Africa, as far up as Salisbury, in central Rhodesia, at least 99 per cent of the big game has disappeared before the white man's rifle. Let him who doubts this scan the census of wild animals still living in Cape Colony. From all the other regions of Africa that are easily accessible to gunners, the animal life is vigorously being shot out, and no man in his senses will now say that the big game is breeding faster than it is being killed. The reverse is painfully true. Mr. Carl Akeley, in his quest for a really large male elephant for the American Museum found and looked over _a thousand_ males without finding one that was really fine and typical. All the photographs of elephant herds that were taken by Kermit Roosevelt and Akeley show a striking absence of adult males and of females with long tusks. There are only young males, and young females with small, short tusks. The answer is--the white ivory hunters have killed nearly all the elephants bearing good ivory. The slaughter of big game is going on furiously in British East Africa because the Uganda Railway opens up the entire territory to hunters. Anyone, man or woman, who can raise $5,000 in cash can go there and make a huge ""bag"" of big game. With a license costing only $250 he can kill enough big game to sink a ship. The bag limit in British East Africa is ruinously extravagant. If the government desires the extermination of the game, such a bag limit surely will promote that end. It is awful to think that for a petty sum any man may buy the right to kill 300 _head_ of hoofed and horned animals, of 44 species, not counting the carnivorous animals that also may be killed. That bag limit should _immediately_ be reduced _75 per cent_! As matters stand to-day in British East Africa, the big game of the country, outside the three preserves, is absolutely certain to disappear, in about one-fourth of the time that it took South Africa to accomplish the same result. The reasons are obvious:--superior accessibility, more deadly rifles, expert professional guides, and a widespread craze for killing big game. With care and economy, British East Africa should furnish good hunting for two centuries, but as things are going on to-day, twenty years will see a tremendous change for the worse, and a disappearance of game that will literally astonish the natives. German East Africa and Uganda will not exterminate their quotas of big game quite so soon. The absence of railways is a great factor in game-existence. The Congo Free State contains game and sporting possibilities--on the unexplored uplands _between the rivers_,--that are as yet totally unknown to sportsmen at large. We are accustomed to thinking of the whole basin of the Congo as a vast, gloomy and impenetrable forest. There is to-day in Africa a vast reserve supply of grand game. It inhabits regions that are either unknown, or most difficult to penetrate. As a species in point, consider the okapi. Only the boldest and most persistent explorers ever have set foot in its tangled and miasmatic haunts. It may be twenty years before a living specimen can be brought out. The gorilla and the chimpanzee are so well protected by the density of their jungles that they never can be exterminated--until the natives are permitted to have all the firearms that they desire! When that day arrives, it is ""good-night"" to all the wild life that is large enough to eat or to wear. The quagga and the blaubok became _extinct_ before the world learned that their existence was threatened! The giant eland, the sable antelope, the greater kudu, the bontebok, blessbok, the mountain and Burchell zebras, all the giraffes save that of Nigeria, the big waterbucks, the nyala, the sitatunga, the bongo, and the gerenuk--all will go in the same way, everywhere outside the game preserves. The buffalo, zebra and rhinoceros are especially marked for destruction, as annoyances to colonists. You who read of the killing of these species to-day will read of their total disappearance to-morrow. So long as the hunting of them is permitted, their ultimate disappearance is fixed and certain. It is not the way of rifle-shooting English colonists to permit herds of big game to run about merely to be looked at. Naturally, the open plains of Africa, and the thin forests of the plateau regions, will be the first to lose their big game. In the gloomy fastnesses of the great equatorial forests, and other really dense forests wherever found, the elephants, the Derby eland, the bongo, the okapi, the buffaloes (of three species), the bush-pigs, the bushbucks and the forest-loving antelopes generally will live, for possibly one hundred years,--_or until the natives secure plenty of modern firearms and ammunition_. Whenever and wherever savages become supplied with rifles, then it is time to measure each big-game animal for its coffin. The elephants of the great equatorial forest westward of the lake region will survive long after the last eastern elephant has bitten the dust. The pygmy elephant of the lower Congo region (_Elephas pumilio_) will be the last African elephant species to disappear--because it inhabits dense miasmatic jungles, its tusks are of the smallest size, and it has the least commercial value. * * * * * CHAPTER XIX THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THE GAME OF ASIA After a successful survival of man's influence through two thousand years, at last the big game of India has made a good start on the road to vanishment. Up to 1870 it had held its own with a tenacity that was astonishing. In 1877, I found the Ganges--Jumna dooab, the Animallai Hills, the Wynaad Forest and Ceylon literally teeming with herds of game. The Animallais in particular were a hunter's paradise. In each day of hunting, large game of some kind was a certainty. The Nilgiri Hills had been quite well shot out, but in view of the very small area and open, golf-links character of the whole top of that wonderful sky plateau, that was no cause for wonderment. In those days no native shikaree owned and operated a gun,--or at the most very, very few of them did. If a rogue elephant, a man-eating tiger or a nasty leopard became a public nuisance, it was a case for a sahib to come and doctor it with a .577 double-barreled express rifle, worth $150 or more; and the sahibs had shooting galore. I think that no such great wild-life sights as those of the plateau regions of Africa ever were seen in southern Asia. Conditions there are different, and usually the game is widely scattered. The sambar deer and muntjac of the dense forests, the axis of the bamboo glades, the thameng deer of the Burmese jungles, the sladang, or gaur, of the awful Malay tangle, and the big cats and canines will last long and well. The ibexes, markhors, tahr and all the wild sheep eventually will be shot out by sportsmen who are ""sheep crazy."" The sheep and goats of Asia will disappear soon after the plains animals of Africa, because no big game that lives in the open can much longer endure the modern, inexpensive long-range rifles of deadly accuracy and limitless repetition of fire. Eventually, I fear that by some unlucky turn of Fortune's wheel all the native hunters of Asia will obtain rifles; and when they do, we soon will see the end of the big game. Even to-day we find that the primitive conditions of 1877 have been greatly changed. In the first place, about every native shikaree (hunter) owns a rifle, at a cost of about $25; and many other natives possess guns, and assume to hunt with them. The logical conclusion of this is more hunting and less game. The development of the country has reduced the cover for game. New roads and railways have made the game districts easily accessible, and real sportsmen are now three or four times as numerous as they were in 1877. At Toonacadavoo, in the Animallai Hills where thirty-five years ago there modestly nestled on the ridge beside the river only Forest Ranger Theobold's bungalow, built of mud and covered with grass thatch and bamboo rats, there is now a regular hill station lighted by electricity, a modern sanatorium high up on the bluff, a _club_, golf links, and other modern improvements. In my day there were exactly four guns on the Animallais. Now there are probably one hundred; and it is easy to guess how much big game remains on the Delectable Mountains in comparison with the golden days of 1877. I should say that there is now only one game animal for every twenty-five that were there in my day. I am told that it is like that all over India. Beyond question, the gun-sellers and gun-users have been busy there, as everywhere else. The game of India is on the toboggan slide, and the old days of abundance have gone forever. The first fact that strikes us in the face is the impending fate of the great Indian rhinoceros, an animal as wonderful as the Titanothere or the Megatherium. It is like a gift handed down to us straight out of the Pleistocene age, a million years back. The British paleontologists to-day marvel at _Elephas ganesa_, and by great labor dig his bones out of the Sewalik rocks, but what one of them all has yet made a move to save _Rhinoceros indicus_ from the quick extermination that soon will be his portion unless he is accorded perpetual and real protection from the assaults of man? Let the mammalogists of the world face this fact. The available cover of the Indian rhinoceros is _alarmingly_ decreasing, throughout Assam and Bengal where the behemoth of the jungle has a right to live. It is believed that the few remaining rhinos are being shot much faster then they are breeding; and what will be the effect of this upon an animal that requires fourteen years to reach full maturity? To-day, the most wonderful hoofed mammal of all Asia is booked for extermination, and unless very radical measures for its preservation are at once carried into effect, it is probable that twenty years more will see the last Indian rhino go down to rise no more. One remedy would be a good, ample rhinoceros preserve; and another, the most absolute and permanent protection for the species, all along the line. Half-way measures will not suffice. It is time to ring in a general alarm. During the past eighteen years, only three specimens of that species have come out of India for the zoological gardens and parks of the world, and I think there are only five in captivity, all told. We are told that in India now the natives are permitted to have about all the firearms they can pay for. Naturally, in a country containing over 300,000,000 people this is a deadly thing. Of course there are shooting regulations, many of them; but their enforcement is so imperfect that it is said that the natives are attacking the big game on all sides, with deadly effect. I fear it is utterly impossible for the Indian government to put enough wardens into the field to watch the doings of the grand army of native poachers. Fortunately, the Indian native,--unlike the western frontiersman,--does not contend that _he owns_ the big game, or that ""all men are born free and equal."" At the same time, he means to have his full share of it, to eat, and to sell in various forms for cash. Even in India, the sale-of-game dragon has reared its head, and is to-day in need of being scotched with an iron hand. When I received direct from a friend in the native state of Kashmir a long printed circular setting forth the hunting laws and game-protective measures of that very interesting principality, it gave me a shock. It was disquieting to be thus assured that the big game of Kashmir has disappeared to such an extent that strong protective measures are necessary. It was as if the Chief Eskimo of Etah had issued a strong proclamation for the saving of the musk-ox. In Kashmir, the destruction of game has become so serious that a Game Preservation Department has been created, with the official staff that such an organization requires. The game laws are printed annually, and any variations from them may be made only by the authority of the Maharajah himself. Up to date, _eight_ game preserves have been created, having a total area of about thee hundred square miles. In addition to these, there are twelve small preserves, each having an area of from twenty-five to fifty square miles. By their locations, these seem to provide for all the species of big game that are found in Kashmir,--the ibex, two forms of markhor, the tahr. Himalayan bighorn sheep, burrhel and goral. In our country we have several states that are very large, very diversified in surface, and still inhabited by large game. Has any one of those states created a series of game preserves even half way comparable with those of Kashmir? I think not. Montana has made a beginning with two preserves,--Snow Creek and the Pryor Mountains,--but beside the splendid series of Kashmir they are not worthy of serious mention. And then following closely in the wake of that document came a lengthy article in the ""Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,"" by E.C. Stebbing, in which a correspondent of the Indian _Field_ clearly sets forth the fact that the big game of the Himalayas now is menaced by a peril new to our consideration, but of a most deadly character. Hear him: ""In this inventory (of game destroyers in India), the Gurkha soldier does not find a place, for he belongs to a class which he amply fills by himself with his small but very important personality. He deserves separate notice. From the banks of the Sarda on the frontier of Nepal, to the banks of the Indus, the battalions of these gallant little men are scattered in cantonments all along the outer spurs of the Himalayan range. In seven or eight of these locations there are at least 14,000 of these disciplined warriors, who, in the absence of opportunities for spilling human blood legitimately, are given a free hand for slaughtering wild animals, along five-hundred miles of the best hunting grounds of Upper India."" Now, since those facts must be true as reported, do they not in themselves constitute a severe arraignment of the Indian government? Why should that state of game slaughter endure, when a single executive order to the C.O. of each post would effectually stop it? In the making of game preserves, or ""sanctuaries"" as they are called out there, the Government of India has shown rare and commendable diligence. The total number is too great for enumeration here. The native state of Mysore has seven, and the Nilgiri Hills have sanctuaries aggregating about 100,000 acres in area. In the Wynaad Forest, my old hunting-grounds at Mudumallay have been closed to bison shooting, because of the alarming decrease of bison (gaur) through shooting and disease. The Kundah Forest Reserve has been made a partial game preserve, but the door might as well have been left wide open as so widely ajar. In eastern Bengal and Assam, several game preserves have been created. On the whole, by the diligence and thoroughness with which sanctuaries, as they are termed, have been created quite generally throughout India, it is quite evident that the government and the sportsmen of India have become thoroughly alarmed by the great decrease of the game, and the danger of the extermination of species. In the past India has been the finest and best-stocked hunting-ground of all Asia, quite beyond compare, and the destruction of her once-splendid fauna of big game would be a zoological calamity. _Tibet_.--As yet, Tibet offers free hunting, without legal let or hindrance, to every sportsman who can climb up to her lofty, wind-swept and whizzing-cold plateau. The man who hunts the _Ovis poli_, superb creature though it be, pays in full for his trophies. The ibex of the south help out the compensatory damages, but even with that, the list of species available in southern Tibet is painfully small. The Mitchell takin can be reached from China, via Chungking, after a long, hard journey, over Consul Mason Mitchell's trail; but the takin is about the only large hoofed game available. _The Altai Mountains_, of western China, contain the magnificent Siberian argali, the grandfather of all sheep species, whose horns must be seen to be believed. Through a quest for that species the Russian military authorities played upon Mr. George L. Harrison and his comrade a very grim and unsportsmanlike joke. At the frontier military post, on the Russo-Chinese border, the two Americans were courteously halted, hospitably entertained, and _prevented_ from going into the argali-infested mountains that loomed up before them only a few miles away! The Russian officers said: ""Sheep? Why, if you really want sheep, we will send out some of our brave soldiers to shoot some for you; but there is no need for _you_ to take the trouble to go after them!"" After Mr. Harrison and his comrade had spent $5,000, and traveled half way around the world for those sheep, that is in brief the story of how the cup of Tantalus was given them by the Russians, actually _at their goal_! As spoil-sports, those Russian officers were the champions of the world. Seven hundred miles southeastward of the Altai Mountains of western China, guarded by the dangerous hostility of savage native tribes, there exists and awaits the scientific explorer, according to report, an undiscovered wild horse. The Bicolored Wild Horse is black and white, and joy awaits the zoologist or sportsman who sees it first. Evidently it will not soon be exterminated by modern rifles. _The Impenetrable Forests_.--Although the mountains of central Asia will in time be cleared of their big game,--when by hook and by crook the natives secure plenty of modern firearms,--there are places in the Far East that we know will contain big game forever and a day. Take the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra as examples. Mr. C. William Beebe, who recently has visited the Far East, has described how the state of Selangor, between Malacca and Penang, has taken on many airs of improvement since 1878, and sections of Sarawak Territory are being cut down and burned for the growing of rubber. Despite this I am trying to think that those developments menace the total volume of the wild life of those regions but little. I wonder if those tangled, illimitable, ever-renewing jungles yet know that their faces have been scratched. White men never will exterminate the big game of the really dense jungles of the eastern tropics; but with enough axes, snares, guns and cartridges _the natives_ may be able to accomplish it! In Malayana there are some jungles so dense, so tangled with lianas and so thorny with Livistonias and rattan that nothing larger than a cat can make way through them. There are thousands of square miles so boggy, so swampy, so dark, gloomy and mosquito-ridden that all men fear them and avoid them, and in them rubber culture must be impossible. In those silent places the gaur, the rhino, the Malay sambar, the clouded leopard and the orang-utan surely are measurably safe from the game-bags and market gunners of the shooting world. It is good to think that there is an equatorial belt of jungle clear around the world, in Central and South America as well as in the old World, in which there will be little extermination in our day, except of birds for the feather market. But the open plains, open mountains, and open forests of Asia and Australasia are in different case. Eventually they will be ""shot out."" China, all save Yunnan and western Mongolia, is now horribly barren of wild life. Can it ever be brought back? We think it can not. The millions of population are too many; and except in the great forest tracts, the spread of modern firearms will make an end of the game. Already the pheasants are being swept out of China for the London market, and extinction is staring several species in the face. On the whole, the pheasants of the Old World are being hit hard by the rubber-planting craze. Mr. Beebe declares that owing to the inrush of aggressive capital, the haunts of many species of pheasants are being denuded of all their natural cover, and some mountain species that are limited to small areas are practically certain to be exterminated at an early date. DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS FOR FUR.--In the far North, only the interior of Kamchatka seems to be safe from the iron heel of the skin-hunter. A glance at the list of furs sold in London last year reveals one or two things that are disquieting. The total catch of furs for the year 1911 is enormous,--considering the great scarcity of wild life on two continents. Incidentally it must be remembered that every trapper carries a gun, and in studying the fur list one needs no help in trying to imagine the havoc wrought with firearms on the edible wild life of the regions that contributed all that fur. I have been told by trappers that as a class, trappers are great killers of game. In order that the reader may know by means of definite figures the extent to which the world is being raked and combed for fur-bearing animals, we append below a statement copied from the _Fur News Magazine_ for November, 1912, of the sales of the largest London fur house during the past two years. With varying emotions we call attention to the wombat of Australia, 3,841; grebe, 51,261, and house cat, 92,407. Very nearly all the totals of Lampson & Co. for each species are much lower for the sales of 1912 than for those of 1911. Is this fact significant of a steady decline? * * * * * FURS SOLD BY C.M.

WILLIAM BEEBE Curator of Birds, New York Zoological Park [Footnote G: The observations which furnished this valuable chapter were made by Mr. Beebe in 1911 while conducting an expedition in southern Asia, Borneo and Java for the purpose of studying in life and nature all the members of the Pheasant Family inhabiting that region. The results of these studies and collections will shortly appear in a very complete monograph of the Phasianidae.--W.T.H.] In chapter XIII, treating of the ""Extermination of Birds for Women's Hats,"" Dr. Hornaday has dealt fully with the feather and plumage traffic after it enters the brokers' hands, and has proved conclusively that the plumes of egrets are gathered from the freshly killed birds. We may trace the course of the plumes and feathers backward through the tightly-packed bales and boxes in the holds of the vessels to the ports of the savage lands whence they were shipped; then to the skilful, dark hands of Mexican peon, Venezuelan Indian, African negro or Asiatic Chinaman or Malay, who stripped the skin from the flesh; and finally to the jungle or mountain side or terai where the bird gave up its life to blowpipe, cross-bow, blunderbuss or carefully set snare. In various trips to Mexico, Venezuela and other countries in the tropics of the New World I have seen many such scenes, but not until I had completed a seventeen months' expedition in search of pheasants, through some twenty wild countries of Asia and the East Indies, did I realize the havoc which is being wrought week by week everywhere on the globe. While we were absent even these few months from the great centers of civilization, tremendous advances had been made in air-ships and the thousand and one other modern phases of human development, but evolution in the world of Nature as we observed it was only destructive--a world-wide katabolism--a retrogression often discernible from month to month. We could scarcely repeat the trip and make the same observations upon pheasants, so rapidly is this group of birds approaching extinction. The causes of this destruction of wild life are many and diverse, and resemble one another only in that they all emanate from mankind. To the casual traveller the shooting and trapping of birds for millinery purposes at first seems to hold an insignificant place among the causes. But this is only because in many of the larger ports, the protective laws are more or less operative and the occupation of the plume hunter is carried on in secret ways. But it is as far-reaching and insidious as any; and when we add to the actual number of birds slain, the compound interest of eggs grown cold, of young birds perishing slowly from hunger, of the thousands upon thousands of birds which fall wounded or dead among the thick tropical jungle foliage and are lost, the total is one of ghastly proportions. Not to weaken my argument with too many general statements, let me take at once some concrete cases. First, that of the Himalayan pheasants and game-birds. In a recent interesting article by E.P. Stebbing[H] the past, present and hoped-for future of game birds and animals in India is reviewed. Unfortunately, however, most of the finest creatures in Asia live beyond the border of the British sphere of influence, and though within sight, are absolutely beyond reach of civilized law. The heart of the Himalayas,--the haunts of some of the most beautiful birds in the world, the tragopans, the blood and impeyan pheasants--lies within the limits of Nepal, a little country which time and time again has bade defiance to British attacks, and still maintains its independence. From its northern border Mt. Everest looks down from its most exalted of all earthly summits and sees valley after valley depleted of first one bird and then another. I have seen and lived with Nepalese shepherds who have nothing to do month after month but watch their flocks. In the lofty solitudes time hangs heavy on their hands, and with true oriental patience they weave loop after loop of yak-hair snares, and then set them, not in dozens or scores, but in hundreds and thousands up and down the valleys. [Footnote H: ""Game Sanctuaries and Game Protection in India,"" Proc. Zool. Soc., London, 1912. pp. 23-35.] In one locality seven great valleys had been completely cleared of pheasants, only a single pair of tragopans remaining; and from one of these little brown men I took two hundred nooses which had been prepared for these lone survivors. In these cases, the birds were either cooked and eaten at once, or sold to some passing shepherd or lama for a few annas. But in other parts of this unknown land systematic collecting of skins goes on, for bale after bale of impeyan and red argus (tragopan) pheasant skins goes down to the Calcutta wharves, where its infamous contents, though known, are safe from seizure under the Nepal Raja's seal! Thus it is that the London feather sales still list these among the most splendid of all living birds. And shame upon shame, when we read of 80 impeyan skins ""dull,"" or ""slightly defective,"" we know that these are female birds. Then, if ever, we realize that the time of the bird and the beast is passing, the acme of evolution for these wonderful beings is reached, and at most we can preserve only a small fragment of them. To the millinery hunter, what the egret is to America, and the bird of paradise to New Guinea, the impeyan pheasant is to India--the most coveted of all plumages. There is a great tendency to blame the native hunter for the decrease of this and other pheasants, and from what I have personally seen in many parts of the Himalayas there is no question that the Garwhalese and Nepalese hill-men have wrought havoc among the birds. But these men are by no means the sole cause. As long ago as 1879 we read that ""The great demand for the brilliant skins of the moonal that has existed for many years has led to their almost total extermination in some parts of the hills, as the native shikaris shoot and snare for the pot as well as for skins, and kill as many females as males. On the other hand, though for nearly thirty years my friend Mr. Wilson has yearly sent home from 1,000 to 1,500 skins of this species and the tragopan, there are still in the woods whence they were obtained as many as, if not more than, when he first entered them, simply because he has rigidly preserved females and nests, and (as amongst English pheasants) one cock suffices for several hens."" [Illustration: PHEASANT SNARES Made of Yak Hair, Taken from a Shepherd in Nepal by Mr. Beebe] Ignoring the uncertainty of the last statement, it is rather absurd to think of a single man ""preserving"" females and nests in the Himalayas from 1850 to 1880, when the British Government, despite most efficient laws and worthy efforts is unable to protect the birds of these wild regions to-day. The statement that after thirty to forty-five thousand cock impeyans were shot or snared, as many or more than the original quota remained, could only emanate from the mind of a professional feather-hunter, and Hume should not be blamed for more than the mere repetition of such figures. Let it be said to the credit of Wilson, the slaughterer of something near forty-five thousand impeyans, that he was a careful observer of the birds' habits, and has given us an excellent account, somewhat coloured by natives, but on the whole, the best we have had in the past. But it is not pleasant to read of his waiting until ""twenty or thirty have got up and alighted in the surrounding trees, and have then walked up to the different trees and fired at those I wished to procure without alarming the rest, only those very close to the one fired at being disturbed at each report."" Hume's opinion that in 1879 there were scores of places where one might secure from ten to eighteen birds in a day, is certainly not true to-day. Indeed, as early as 1858 we read that ""This splendid bird, once so abundant on the Western Himalayas is now far from being so, in consequence of the numbers killed by sportsmen on account of its beauty. Whole tracts of mountain forest once frequented by the moonal are now almost without a single specimen."" The same author goes on naively to tell the reader that ""Among the most pleasant reminiscences of bygone days is a period of eleven days, spent by the author and a friend on the Choor Mountain near Simia, when among other trophies were numbered sixty-eight moonal pheasants, etc."" [Illustration: SILVER PHEASANT SKINS SEIZED AT RANGOON, BRITISH BURMA About 600 Skins out of Several Thousand Confiscated in the Custom House, on their way to the London Feather Market. Photographed by Mr. Beebe] For some unaccountable reason there is, or was for many years, a very prevalent idea that the enormous number of skins which have poured into the London market were from birds bred in the vicinity of Calcutta. When we remember the intense heat of that low-lying city, and learn from the records of the Calcutta Zoological Garden that impeyans and tragopans are even shorter-lived than in Europe, the absurdity of the idea is apparent. In spite of numberless inquiries throughout India, I failed to learn of a single captive young bird ever hatched and reared even in the high, cool, hill-stations. The commercial value of an impeyan skin has varied from five dollars to twenty dollars, according to the number received annually. In 1876 an estimate placed the monthly average of impeyans received in London at from two to eight hundred. In such a case as Nepal, direct protective laws are of no avail. All humane arguments are useless, but if the markets at the other end _can be closed_, the slaughter will cease instantly and automatically. [Illustration: DEADFALL TRAPS IN BURMA A Long Series set Across a Valley, by the Kachins of the Burma-Chinese Border. A Wholesale Method of Wild-life Slaughter, Photographed by C. William Beebe, 1910] As a contrast to the millinery hunter of fifty years ago it is refreshing to find that at last sincere efforts are being made in British possessions to stop this traffic. I happened to be at Rangoon when six large bales of pheasant skins were seized by the Custom officials. A Chinaman had brought them from Yunnan via Bhamo, and was preparing to ship them as ducks' feathers. Two of the bales were opened for my inspection. The first contained about five hundred Lady Amherst pheasant skins, falling to pieces and lacking heads and legs. The second held over four hundred silver pheasants, in almost perfect condition. The chief collector had put the absolutely prohibitive fine of 200 pounds on them, and was waiting for the expiration of the legal number of days before burning the entire lot. They must have represented years of work in decimating the pheasant fauna of western China. Far up in the wilderness of northern Burma, and over the Yunnan border, we often came upon some of the most ingenious examples of native trapping, a system which we found repeated in the Malay States, Borneo, China and other parts of the Far East. A low bamboo fence is built directly across a steep valley or series of valleys, about half way from the summit to the lower end, and about every fifteen feet a narrow opening is left, over which a heavy log is suspended. Any creature attempting to make its way through, treads upon several small sticks and by so doing springs the trap and the dead-fall claims a victim. When a country is systematically strung with traps such as these, sooner or later all but a pitiful remnant of the smaller mammals, birds and reptiles are certain to be wiped out. Morning after morning I have visited such a runway and found dead along its path, what must have been all the walking, running or crawling creatures which the night before had sought the water at the bottom; pheasants, cobras, mouse-deer, rodents, civets, and members of many other groups. In some countries nooses instead of dead-falls guard the openings, but the result is equally deadly. I have described this method of trapping because of its future importance in the destruction of wild life in the Far East. The Chinaman in all his many millions is undergoing a remarkably swift and radical evolution both of character and dress. In many ways, if only from the viewpoint of the patient, thrifty store-keeper he is a most powerful factor in the East, and is becoming more so. In many cases he imitates the white nations by cutting off his queue and altering his dress. In some mysterious correlated way his diet seems simultaneously affected, and while for untold generations rice and fish has satisfied all his gastronomic desires, a new craving, that for meat, has come to him. The result is apparent in many parts of the East. The Chinaman is willing and able to pay for meat, and the native finds a new market for the creatures about him. Again and again when I wished a few specimens of some certain pheasant I had but to hail passing canoes and bid a few annas or ""cash"" or ""ringits"" higher than the prospective Chinese purchaser would give, and the pheasants were mine. In the catalogues of the brokers' sales of feathers we read of many thousands of the wonderful ocellated wing feathers of the argus pheasant, but no less horrible is the sight of a canoe crammed with the bedraggled bodies of these magnificent birds on their way to some Chinese hamlet where they will be sold for a pittance, the flesh eaten to the last tendon and the feathers given to the children and puppies to play with. The newly-aroused appetite of the Mongolian will soon be an important factor in the extermination of animals and birds, few species being exempt, for the Chinaman lives up to his reputation and is not squeamish as to the nature of his meat. Before we leave the subject of Chinamen let us consider another recent factor in the destruction of wild life which is at present widely operative in China itself. This is the cold storage warehouse, of which six or eight enormous ones have gone up in different parts of the East. To speak in detail only of the one at Hankow, six hundred miles up the Yangtze, we found it to be the largest structure in the city. Surrounded by a high wall, with each entrance and exit guarded by armed Sikhs, it seemed like the feudal castle of some medieval baron. Why such secrecy is necessary I could not learn, as there are no laws against its business. But so carefully guarded is its premises that until a short time ago even the British consul-general of Hankow had not been allowed to enter. He, however, at last refused to sign the papers for any more outgoing shipments until he should be allowed to see what was going on within the warehouse. I hoped to be able to look over some of the frozen pheasants for interesting scientific material, but of course was not allowed to do so. Although here in the heart of China, outside changes are not felt so strongly and the newly-acquired meat diet of the border and emigrant Chinese is hardly apparent, these warehouses have opened up a new source of revenue, which has met with instant response. Thousands and tens of thousands of wild shot or trapped pheasants and other birds are now brought to these establishments by the natives from far and near. The birds are frozen, and twice a year shipped on specially refrigerated P. and O. steamships to England and the continent of Europe where they seem to find a ready sale. Pigs and chickens also figure in the shipments. Now the pheasants have for centuries existed in enormous numbers in the endless ricefields of China, without doing any damage to the crops. In fact they could not be present in such numbers without being an important factor in keeping down insect and other enemies of the grain. When their numbers are decimated as they are being at present, there must eventually result a serious upsetting of the balance of nature. Let us hope that in some way this may be avoided, and that the present famine deaths of thirty thousand or more in some provinces will not be increased many fold. When I started on this search for pheasants I was repeatedly told by old explorers in the east that my task would be very different from theirs of thirty years ago; that I would find steamers, railroads and automobiles where formerly were only canoes and jungle. I indeed found this as reported, but while my task was different it was made no easier. Formerly, to be sure, one had from the start to paddle slowly or push along the trails made by natives or game animals. But then the wild life was encountered at once, while I found it always far from the end of the steamer's route or the railroad's terminal, and still to be reached only by the most primitive modes of travel. I cite this to give point to my next great cause of destruction; the burning and clearing of vast stretches of country for the planting of rubber trees. The East seems rubber mad, and whether the enormous output which will result from the millions of trees set out month after month will be profitable, I cannot say. I can think only of the vanishing of the _entire fauna_ and _flora_ of many districts which I have seen as a direct result of this commercial activity. One leaves Port Swettenham on the west coast of Selangor, and for the hour's run to Kuala Lumpur sees hardly anything but vast radiating lines of spindling rubber trees, all underbrush cleared, all native growths vanished. From Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Kubu at the very foot of the mountain backbone of the Malay Peninsula, the same holds true. And where some area appears not under cultivation, the climbing fern and a coarse, useless ""lalang"" grass covers every inch of ground. One can hardly imagine a more complete blotting out of the native fauna and flora of any one limited region. And ever-extending roads for the increasing motor cars are widening the cleared zone, mile after mile to the north and south. In this region, as we pushed on over the mountains into the wilderness of Pahang, we saw little of the actual destruction of the primeval native growth, but elsewhere it became a common sight. Once, for many days we studied the wonderful life of a jungle which stretched up to our very camp. Troops of rollicking wa-was or gibbons frequented the forest; squirrels, tupaias, birds and insects in myriads were everywhere during the day. Great fruit-bats, flying lemurs, owls and other nocturnal creatures made the evenings and nights full of interest. And then, one day without warning came the sound of an ax, and another and another. From that moment the songs, cries, chirps and roars of the jungle were seldom heard from our camp. Every day saw new phalanxes of splendid primeval trees fallen, or half suspended in their rigging of lianas. The leaves withered, the flower petals fell and we heard no more the crackling of bamboos in the wind. Then the pitiful survivors of the destruction were brought to us; now a baby flying lemur, flung from its hole by the falling of some tree; young tupaias, nestling birds; a few out of the thousands of creatures from insects to mammals which were slain so that a Chinaman or Malay might eke a few dollars, four or five years hence, from a grove of rubber trees. I do not say it is wrong. Man has won out, and might is right, as since the dawn of creation; but to the onlooker, to the lover of nature and the animal world it is a terrible, a hopeless thing. One cannot at present leave the tourist line of travel in the East without at once encountering evidence of the wholesale direct slaughter of wild life, or its no less certain extermination by the elimination of the haunts and the food plants of the various beasts and birds. * * * * * CHAPTER XXI THE SAVAGE VIEW-POINT OF THE GUNNER The mental attitude of the men who shoot constitutes a deadly factor in the destruction of wild life and the extermination of species. Fully ninety-five per cent of the sportsmen, gunners and other men and boys who kill game, all over the world and in all nations, regard game birds and mammals only as things to be killed _and eaten_, and not as creatures worth preserving for their beauty or their interest to mankind. This is precisely the viewpoint of the cave-man and the savage, and it has come down from the Man-with-a-Club to the Man-with-a-Gun absolutely unchanged save for one thing: the latter sometimes is prompted to save to-day in order to slaughter to-morrow. The above statement of an existing fact may seem harsh; and some persons may be startled by it; but it is based on an acquaintance with thousands of men who shoot all kinds of game, all over the world. My critics surely will admit that my opportunities to meet the sportsmen and gunners of the world are, and for thirty-five years have been, rather favorable. As a matter of fact, I think the efforts of the hunters of my personal acquaintance have covered about seven-tenths of the hunting grounds of the world. If the estimate that I have formed of the average hunter's viewpoint is wrong, or even partially so, I will be glad to have it proven in order that I may reform my judgment and apologize. In working with large bodies of bird-shooting sportsmen I have steadily--and also painfully--been impressed by their intentness on. killing, and by the fact that _they seek to preserve game only to kill it!_ Who ever saw a bird-shooter rise in a convention and advocate the preservation of any species of game bird on account of its beauty or its esthetic interest _alive?_ I never did; and I have sat in many conventions of sportsmen. All the talk is of open seasons, bag limits and killing rights. The man who has the hardihood to stand up and propose a five-year close season has ""a hard row to hoe."" Men rise and say: ""It's all nonsense! There's plenty of quail shooting on Long Island yet."" Throughout the length and breadth of America, the ruling passion is to kill as long as anything killable remains. The man who will openly advocate the stopping of quail-shooting because the quails are of such great value to the farmers, or because they are so _beautiful_ and companionable to man, receives no sympathy from ninety per cent of the bird-killing sportsmen. The remaining ten per cent think seriously about the matter, and favor long close seasons. It is my impression that of the men who shoot, it is only among the big-game hunters that we find much genuine admiration for game animals, or any feeling remotely resembling regard for it. The moment that a majority of American gunners concede the fact that game birds are worth preserving for their beauty, and their value as living neighbors to man, from that moment there is hope for the saving of the Remnant. That will indeed be the beginning of a new era, of a millennium in fact, in the preservation of wild life. It will then be easy to enact laws for ten-year close seasons on whole groups of species. Think what it would mean for such a close season to be enacted for all the grouse of the United States, all the shore-birds of the United States, or the wild turkey wherever found! To-day, the great--indeed, the _only_--opponents of long close seasons on game birds are the gunners. Whenever and wherever you introduce a bill to provide such a season, you will find that this is true. The gun clubs and the Downtrodden Hunters' and Anglers' Protective Associations will be quick to go after their representatives, and oppose the bill. And state senators and assemblymen will think very hard and with strong courage before they deliberately resolve to do their duty regardless of the opposition of ""a large body of sportsmen,""--men who have votes, and who know how to take revenge on lawmakers who deprive them of their ""right"" to kill. The greatest speech ever made in the Mexican Congress was uttered by the member who solemnly said: ""I rise to sacrifice ambition to honor!"" Unfortunately, the men who shoot have become possessed of the idea that they have certain inherent, God-given ""rights"" to kill game! Now, as a matter of fact, a sportsman with a one-hundred-dollar Fox gun in his hands, a two-hundred-dollar dog at his heels and five one-hundred-dollar bills in his pocket has no more ""right"" to kill a covey of quail on Long Island than my milkman has to elect that it shall be let alone for the pleasure of his children! The time has come when the people who don't shoot must do one of two things: 1. They must demonstrate the fact that they have rights in the wild creatures, and demand their recognition, or 2. See the killable game all swept off the continent by the Army of Destruction. Really, it is to me very strange that gunners never care to save game birds on account of their beauty. One living bob white on a fence is better than a score in a bloody game-bag. A live squirrel in a tree is poetry in motion; but on the table a squirrel is a rodent that tastes as a rat smells. Beside the ocean a flock of sandpipers is needed to complete the beautiful picture; but on the table a sandpiper is beneath contempt. A live deer trotting over a green meadow, waving a triangular white flag, is a sight to thrill any human ganglion; but a deer lying dead,--unless it has an exceptionally fine head,--is only so much butcher's meat. One of the finest sights I ever saw in Montana was a big flock of sage grouse slowly stalking over a grassy flat thinly sprinkled with sage-brush. It was far more inspiring than any pile of dead birds that I ever saw. I remember scores of beautiful game birds that I have seen and not killed; but of all the game birds that I have eaten or tried to eat in New York, I remember with sincere pleasure only _one_. Some of the ancient cold-storage candidates I remember ""for cause,"" as the lawyers say. [Illustration: ONE MORNING'S CATCH OF TROUT, NEAR SPOKANE Another Line of Extermination According to law. Three Times too Many Fish for one rod. In those Cold Mountain Streams, Fish Grow Slowly, and a Stream is Quickly ""Fished out""] Sportsmen and gunners, for God's sake elevate your viewpoint of the game of the world. Get out of the groove in which man has run ever since the days of Adam! There is something in a game bird over and above its pound of flesh. You don't ""need"" the meat any longer; for you don't know what hunger is, save by reading of it. Try the field-glass and the camera, instead of the everlasting gun. Any fool can take a five-dollar gun and kill a bird; but it takes a genius to photograph one wild bird and get ""a good one."" As hunters, the camera men have the best of it. One good live-bird photograph is more of a trophy and a triumph than a bushel of dead birds. The birds and mammals now are literally dying for _your_ help in the making of long close seasons, and in the real stoppage of slaughter. Can you not hear the call of the wild remnant? It is time for the people who don't shoot to call a halt on those who do; ""and if this be treason, then let my enemies make the most of it!"" Since the above was written, I have read in the _Outdoor World_ for April, 1912, the views of a veteran sportsman and writer, Mr. Emerson Hough, on the wild-life situation as it seems to him to-day. It is a strong utterance, even though it reaches a pessimistic and gloomy conclusion which I do not share. Altogether, however, its breadth of view, its general accuracy, and its incisiveness, entitle it to a full hearing. The following is only an extract from a lengthy article entitled, ""God's Acre:"" * * * * * EMERSON HOUGH'S VIEW OF THE SITUATION The truth is none the less the truth because it is unpleasant to face. There is no well posted sportsman in America, no manufacturer of sporting goods in America, no man well versed in American outdoor matters, who does not know that we are at the evening of the day of open sport in America. Our old ways have failed, all of them have failed. The declining fortunes of the best sportsman's journals of America would prove that, if proof were asked. Our sportsmanship has failed. Our game laws have failed, and we know they have failed. Our game is almost gone, and we know it is almost gone. America has changed and we know that it has changed, although we have not changed with it. The old America is done and it is gone, and we know that to be the truth. The old order passeth, and we know that the new order must come soon if it is to work any salvation for our wild game and our life in the open in pursuit of it. There are many reasons for this fact, these facts. Perhaps the greatest lies in the steady advance of civilization into the wilderness, the usurpation for agricultural or industrial use of many of the ancient breeding and feeding places of the wild game. All over the West and now all over Canada, the plow advances, that one engine which cannot be gainsaid, which never turns a backward furrow. Another great agency is the rapid perfection of transportation all over the world. Take the late influx of East African literature. If there really were not access to that country we would not have this literature, would not have so many pictures from that country. And if even Africa will soon be overrun, if even Africa soon will be shot out, what hope is there for the game of the wholly accessible North American continent? It is all too easy now for the slaughterer to get to his work, all too easy for him to transport the fruits of the slaughter. At the hands of the ignorant, the unscrupulous and the unsparing, our game has steadily disappeared until it is almost gone. We have handled it in a wholly greedy, unscrupulous and selfish fashion. This has been our policy as a nation. If there is to be success for any plan to remedy this, it must come from a few large-minded men, able to think and plan, and able to do more than that--to follow their plans with deeds. I have seen the whole story of modern American sportsmanship, so called. It has been class legislation and organized selfishness--that is what it has been, and nothing else. I do not blame country legislators, game dealers, farmers, for calling the sportsmen of America selfish and thoughtless. I do not blame them for saying that the so-called protective measures advanced by sportsmen have been selfish measures, and looking to destruction rather than to protection. At least that has been their actual result. I have no more reverence for a sportsman than for anyone else, and no reverence for him at all because he is or calls himself a sportsman. He has got to be a man. He has got to be a citizen. I have seen millions of acres of breeding and feeding grounds pass under the drain and under the plow in my own time, so that the passing whisper of the wild fowl's wing has been forgotten there now for many years. I have seen a half dozen species of fine game birds become extinct in my own time and lost forever to the American people. And you and I have seen one protective society after another, languidly organized, paying in a languid dollar or so per capita each year, and so swiftly passing, also to be forgotten. We have seen one code and the other of conflicting and wholly selfish game laws passed, and seen them mocked at and forgotten, seen them all fail, as we all know. We have seen even the nation's power--under that Ark of the Covenant known as the Interstate Commerce Act--fail to stop wholly the lessening of our wild game, so rapidly disappearing for so many reasons. We have seen both selfish and unselfish sportsmen's journals attempt to solve this problem and fail to do so. Some of them were great and broad-minded journals. Their record has not been one of disgrace, although it has been one of defeat; for some of them really desired success more than they desired dividends. These, all of them, bore their share of a great experiment, an experiment in a new land, under a new theory of government, a theory which says a man should be able to restrain himself, and to govern himself. Only by following their theory through to the end of that experiment could they know that it was to fail in one of its most vitally interesting and vitally important phases. But now, as we know, all of these agencies, selfish or unselfish, have failed to effect the salvation of American wild game. Not by any scheme, device, or theory, not by any panacea can the old days of America be brought back to us. * * * * * Mr. Hough's views are entitled to respectful consideration; but on one vital point I do not follow him. I believe most sincerely--in fact, _I know_,--that it is _possible_ to make a few new laws which, in addition to the many, many good protective laws we already have, will bring back the game, just as fast and as far as man's settlements, towns, railroads, mines and schemes in general ever can permit it to come back. If the American People as a whole elect that our wild life shall be saved, and to a reasonable extent brought back, then by the Eternal it will be saved and brought back! The road lies straight before us, and the going is easy--_if_ the Mass makes up its mind to act. But on one vital point Mr. Hough is right. The sportsman alone never will save the game! The people who do not kill must act, independently. * * * * * PART II.--PRESERVATION CHAPTER XXII OUR ANNUAL LOSSES BY INSECTS ""You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live."" ""In no country in the world,"" says Mr. C.L. Marlatt, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ""do insects impose a heavier tax on farm products than in the United States."" These attacks are based upon an enormous and varied annual output of cereals and fruits, and a great variety and number of trees. For every vegetable-eating insect, native and foreign, we seem to have crops, trees and plant food galore; and their ravages rob the market-basket and the dinner-pail. In 1912 there were riots in the streets of New York over the high cost of food. In 1903, this state of fact was made the subject of a special inquiry by the Department of Agriculture, and in the ""Yearbook"" for 1904, the reader will find, on page 461, an article entitled, ""The Annual Loss Occasioned by Destructive Insects in the United States."" The article is not of the sensational type, it was not written in an alarmist spirit, but from beginning to end it is a calm, cold-blooded analysis of existing facts, and the conclusions that fairly may be drawn from them. The opinions of several experts have been considered and quoted, and often their independent figures are stated. With the disappearance of our birds generally, and especially the slaughter of song and other insect-eating birds both in the South and North, the destruction of the national wealth by insects forges to the front as a subject of vital importance. The logic of the situation is so simple a child can see it. Short crops mean higher prices. If ten per cent of our vegetable food supply is destroyed by insects, as certain as fate we will feel it _in the increased cost of living_. I would like to place Mr. Marlatt's report in the hands of every man, boy and school-teacher in America; but I have not at my disposal the means to accomplish such a task. I cannot even print it here in full, but the vital facts can be stated, briefly and in plain figures. * * * * * CROPS AND INSECTS. CORN.--The principal insect enemies of corn are the chinch bug, corn-root worm (_Diabrotica longicornis_), bill bug, wire worm, boll-worm or ear-worm, cut-worm, army worm, stalk worm, grasshopper, and plant lice, in all a total of about fifty important species! Several of these pests work secretly. At husking time the wretched ear-worm that ruins the terminal quarter or fifth of an immense number of ears, is painfully in evidence. The root-worms work insidiously, and the moles and shrews are supposed to attack them and destroy them. The corn-root worm is charged with causing an annual loss of two per cent of the corn crop, or $20,000,000; the chinch bug another two per cent; the boll or ear-worm two per cent more. The remaining insect pests are charged with two per cent, which makes eight per cent in all, or a total of $80,000,000 lost each year to the American farmer through the ravages of insects. This is not evenly distributed, but some areas suffer more than others. [Illustration: THE CUT-WORM, (_Peridroma Sancia_) Very Destructive to Crops] WHEAT.--Of all our cereal crops, wheat is the one that suffers most from insects. There are three insects that cause to the wheat industry an annual loss of about ten per cent. The _chinch bug_ is the worst, and it is charged with five per cent ($20,000,000) of the total loss. The _Hessian fly_ comes next in order, and occasionally rolls up enormous losses. In the year 1900, that insect caused to Indiana and Ohio alone the loss of 2,577,000 _acres_ of wheat, and the total cost to us of that insect in that year ""undoubtedly approached $100,000,000."" Did that affect the price of wheat or not? If not, then there is no such thing as a ""law of supply and demand."" _Wheat plant-lice_ form collectively the third insect pest destructive to wheat, of which it is reported that ""the annual loss occasioned by wheat plant-lice probably does not fall short of two or three per cent of the crop."" HAY AND FORAGE CROPS.--These are attacked by locusts, grasshoppers, army worms, cut-worms, web worms, small grass worms and leaf hoppers. Some of these pests are so small and work so insidiously that even the farmer is prone to overlook their existence. ""A ten per cent shrinkage from these and other pests in grasses and forage plants is a minimum estimate."" COTTON.--The great enemies of the cotton-planter are the cotton boll weevil, the bollworm and the leaf worm; but other insects inflict serious damage. In 1904 the loss occasioned by the boll weevil, chiefly in Texas, was conservatively estimated by an expert, Mr. W.D. Hunter, at $20,000,000. The boll worm of the southwestern cotton states has sometimes caused an annual loss of $12,000,000, or four per cent of the crops in the states affected. Before the use of arsenical poisons, the leaf worm caused an annual loss of from twenty to thirty million dollars; but of late years that total has been greatly reduced. FRUITS.--The insects that reduce our annual fruit crop attack every portion of the tree and its product. The woolly aphis attacks the roots of the fruit tree, the trunk and limbs are preyed upon by millions of scale insects and borers, the leaves are devastated by the all-devouring leaf worms, canker worms and tent caterpillars, while the fruit itself is attacked by the codling moth, curculio and apple maggot. To destroy fruit is to take money out of the farmer's pocket, and to attack and injure the tree is like undermining his house itself. By an annual expenditure of about $8,250,000 in cash for spraying apple trees, the destructiveness of the codling moth and curculio have been greatly reduced, but that money is itself a cash loss. Add to this the $12,000,000 of actual shrinkage in the apple crop, and the total annual loss to our apple-growers due to the codling moth and curculio is about $20,000,000. In the high price of apples, a part of this loss falls upon the consumer. In 1889 Professor Forbes calculated that the annual loss to the fruit-growers of Illinois from insect ravages was $2,375,000. In 1892, insects caused to Nebraska apple-growers a loss computed at $2,000,000 and, in 1897, New York farmers lost $2,500,000 from that cause. ""In many sections of the Pacific Northwest the loss was from fifty to seventy-five per cent."" (Yearbook, page 470.) FORESTS.--""The annual losses occasioned by insect pests to forests and forest products (in the United States) have been estimated by Dr. A.D. Hopkins, special agent in charge of forest insect investigations, at not less than $100,000,000.... It covers both the loss from insect damages to standing timber, and to the crude and manufactured forest products. The annual loss to growing timber is conservatively placed at $70,000,000."" [Illustration: THE GYPSY MOTH, (_Portheria dispar_) Very Destructive to the Finest Shade Trees] There are other insect damages that we will not pause to enumerate here. They relate to cattle, horses, sheep and stored grain products of many kinds. Even cured tobacco has its pest, a minute insect known as the cigarette beetle, now widespread in America and ""frequently the cause of very heavy losses."" The millions of the insect world are upon us.

The birds fight them for us, and when the birds are numerous and have nestlings to feed, the number of insects they consume is enormous. They require absolutely nothing at our hands save _the privilege of being let alone while they work for us!_ In fighting the insects, our only allies in nature are the songbirds, woodpeckers, shore-birds, swallows and martins, certain hawks, moles, shrews, bats, and a few other living creatures. All these wage war at their own expense. The farmers might just as well lose $8,250,000 through a short apple crop as to pay out that sum in labor and materials in spraying operations. And yet, fools that we are, we go on slaughtering our friends, and allowing others to slaughter them, under the same brand of fatuous folly that leads the people of Italy to build anew on the smoking sides of Vesuvius, after a dozen generations have been swept away by fire and ashes. In the next chapter we will consider the work of our friends, The Birds. * * * * * CHAPTER XXIII. THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF BIRDS To-day, from Halifax to Los Angeles, and from Key West to Victoria, a deadly contest is being waged. The fruit-growers, farmers, forest owners and ""park people"" are engaged in a struggle with the insect hordes for the possession of the trees, shrubs and crops. Go out into the open, with your eyes open, and you will see it for yourself. Millions of dollars are being expended in it. Look at this exhibit of what is going on around me, at this very moment,--July 19, 1912: The bag insects, in thousands, are devouring the leaves of locust and maple trees. The elm beetles are trying to devour the elms; and spraying is in progress. The hickory-bark borers are slaughtering the hickories; and even some park people are neglecting to take the measures necessary to stop it! The tent caterpillars are being burned. The aphis (scale insects) are devouring the tops of the _white potatoes_ in the New York University school garden, just as the potato beetle does. The codling moth larvae are already at work on the apples. The leaves affected by the witch hazel gall fly are being cut off and burned. These are merely the most conspicuous of the insect pests that I now see daily. I am not counting those of second or third-rate importance. Some of these hordes are being fought with poisonous sprays, some are being killed by hand, and some are being ignored. In view of the known value of the remaining trees of our country, each woodpecker in the United States is worth twenty dollars in cash. Each nuthatch, creeper and chickadee is worth from five to ten dollars, according to local circumstances. You might just as well cut down four twenty-inch trees and let them lie and decay, as to permit one woodpecker to be killed and eaten by an Italian in the North, or a negro in the South. The downy woodpecker is the relentless enemy of the codling moth, an insect that annually inflicts upon our apple crop damages estimated by the experts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture at twelve million dollars! Now, is a federal strong-arm migratory bird law needed for such birds or not? Let the owners of orchards and forests make answer. THE CASE OF THE CODLING MOTH AND CURCULIO.--The codling moth and curculio are twin terrors to apple-growers, partly because of their deadly destructiveness, and partly because man is so weak in resisting them. The annual cost of the fight made against them, in sprays and labor and apparatus, has been estimated at $8,250,000. And what do the birds do to the codling moth,--when there are any birds left alive to operate? The testimony comes from all over the United States, and it is worth while to cite it briefly as a fair sample of the work of the birds upon this particularly deadly pest. These facts and quotations are from the ""Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture,"" for 1911. [Illustration: DOWNY WOODPECKER] _The Downy Woodpecker_ is the champion tree-protector, and also one of the greatest enemies of the codling moth. When man is quite unable to find the hidden larvae, Downy locates it every time, and digs it out. It extracts worms from young apples so skillfully that often the fruit is not permanently injured. Mr. F.M. Webster reports that the labors of this bird ""afford actual and immediate relief to the infected fruit."" Testimony in favor of the downy woodpecker has come from New York, New Jersey, Texas and California, ""and no fewer than twenty larvae have been taken from a single stomach."" Take the _Red-Shafted Flicker_ vs. the codling moth. Mr. A.P. Martin of Petaluma, Cal., states that during the early spring months (of 1890) they were seen by hundreds in his orchard, industriously examining the trunks and larger limbs of the fruit trees; and he also found great numbers of them around sheds where he stored his winter apples and pears. As the result of several hours' search, Mr. Martin found only one worm, and this one escaped only by accident, for several of the birds had been within a quarter of an inch of it. ""So eager are woodpeckers in search, of codling moths that they have often been known to riddle the shingle traps and paper bands which are placed to attract the larvae about to spin cocoons."" Behold the array of birds that devour the larvae of the codling moth to an important extent. * * * * * BIRDS THAT DEVOUR THE CODLING MOTH Downy Woodpecker (_Dryobates pubescens_).

McAtee, thirty-six species of birds of thirteen families help man in his irrepressible conflict against his deadly enemy, the codling moth. ""In some places they destroy from sixty-six to eighty-five per cent of the hibernating larvae."" Now, are the farmers of this country content to let the Italians of the North, and the negroes of the South, shoot those birds for food, and devour them? What is the great American farmer going to _do_ about this matter? What he should do is to write and urge his members of Congress to work for and vote for the federal migratory bird bill. THE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL.--Let us take one other concrete case. The cotton boll weevil invaded the United States from Mexico in 1894. Ten years later it was costing the cotton planters an annual loss estimated at fifteen million dollars per year. Later on that loss was estimated at twenty million dollars. The cotton boll weevil strikes at the heart of the industry by destroying the boll of the cotton plant. While the total loss never can be definitely ascertained, we know that it has amounted to many millions of dollars. The figure given above has been widely quoted, and so far as I am aware, never disputed. Fortunately we have at hand a government publication on this subject which gives some pertinent facts regarding the bird enemies of the cotton boll weevil. It is Circular No. 57 of the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture. Any one can obtain it by addressing that Department. I quote the most important portions of this valuable document: * * * * * BIRDS USEFUL IN THE WAR AGAINST THE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL. By H.W. Henshaw, Chief of the Biological Survey. The main purpose of this circular is to direct the attention of cotton growers and others in the cotton growing states to the importance of birds in the boll weevil war, to emphasize the need of protection for them, and to suggest means to increase the numbers and extend the range of certain of the more important kinds. Investigations by the Biological Survey show that thirty-eight species of birds eat boll weevils. While some eat them only sparingly others eat them freely, and no fewer than forty-seven adult weevils have been found in the stomach of a single cliff swallow. Of the birds known at the present time to feed on the weevil, among the most important are the orioles, nighthawks, and, foremost of all, the swallows (including the purple martin). ORIOLES.--Six kinds of orioles live in Texas, though but two inhabit the southern states generally. Orioles are among the few birds that evince a decided preference for weevils, and as they persistently hunt for the insects on the bolls, they fill a place occupied by no other birds. They are protected by law in nearly every state in the Union, but their bright plumage renders them among the most salable of birds for millinery purposes, and despite protective laws, considerable numbers are still killed for the hat trade. It is hardly necessary to point out that their importance as insect eaters everywhere demands their protection, but more especially in the cotton belt. NIGHTHAWK.--The nighthawk, or bull-bat, also renders important service in the destruction of weevils, and catches them on the wing in considerable numbers, especially during its migration. Unfortunately, _the nighthawk is eaten for food in some sections of the South, and considerable numbers are shot for this purpose_. The bird's value for food, however, is infinitesimal as compared with the service it renders the cotton grower and other agriculturists, and every effort should be made to spread broadcast a knowledge of its usefulness as a weevil destroyer, with a view to its complete protection. SWALLOWS.--Of all the birds now known to destroy weevils, swallows are the most important. Six species occur in Texas and the southern states. The martin, the barn swallow, the bank swallow, the roughwing, and the cliff swallow breed locally in Texas, and all of them, except the cliff swallow, breed in the other cotton states. The white-bellied, or tree swallow, nests only in the North, and by far the greater number of cliff swallows nest in the North and West. [Illustration: THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE The Deadly Enemy of the Cotton-Boll Weevil From the ""American Natural History""] As showing how a colony of martins thrives when provided with sufficient room to multiply, an experiment by Mr. J. Warren Jacobs, of Waynesburg, Pa., may be cited. The first year five pairs were induced to occupy the single box provided, and raised eleven young. The fourth year three large boxes, divided into ninety-nine rooms, contained fifty-three pairs, and they raised about 175 young. The colony was thus nearly three hundred strong at the close of the fourth season. The effect of this number of hungry martins on the insects infesting the neighborhood may be imagined. From the standpoint of the farmer and the cotton grower, swallows are among the most useful birds. Especially designed by nature to capture insects in midair, their powers of flight and endurance are unexcelled, and in their own field they have no competitors. Their peculiar value to the cotton grower consists in the fact that, like the nighthawk, they capture boll weevils when flying over the fields, which no other birds do. Flycatchers snap up the weevils near trees and shrubbery. Wrens hunt them out when concealed under bark or rubbish. Blackbirds catch them on the ground, as do the killdeer, titlark, meadow lark, and others; while orioles hunt for them on the bolls. But it is the peculiar function of swallows to catch the weevils as they are making long flights, leaving the cotton fields in search of hiding places in which to winter or entering them to continue their work of devastation. Means have been taken to inform residents of the northern states of the value of the swallow tribe to agriculturists generally, and particularly to cotton planters, in the belief that the number of swallows breeding in the North can be substantially increased. The cooperation of the northern states is important, since birds bred in the North migrate directly through the southern states in the fall on their way to the distant tropics, and also in the spring on their return. [Illustration: THE NIGHTHAWK A Goatsucker, not a Song-bird; but it Feeds Exclusively Upon Insects] Important as it is to increase the number of northern breeding swallows, it is still more important to increase the number nesting in the South and to induce the birds there to extend their range over as much of the cotton area as possible. Nesting birds spend much more time in the South than migrants, and during the weeks when the old birds are feeding young they are almost incessantly engaged in the pursuit of insects. It is not, of course, claimed that birds alone can stay the ravages of the cotton boll weevil in Texas, but they materially aid in checking the advance of the pest into the other cotton states. Important auxiliaries, in destroying these insects, birds aid in reducing their numbers within safe limits, and once within safe limits in keeping them there. Hence it is for the interests of the cotton states that special efforts be made to protect and care for the weevil-eating species, and to increase their numbers in every way possible.--(End of the circular.) * * * * * CONDENSED NOTES ON THE FOOD HABITS OF CERTAIN NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. Millions of Americans and near-Americans, both old and young, now need to be shown the actual figures that represent the value of our birds as destroyers of the insects, weeds and the small rodents that are swarming to overrun and devour our fields, orchards and forests. Will our people never learn that in fighting pests the birds are worth ten times more to men than all the poisons, sprays and traps that ever were invented or used? We cannot spray our forests; and if the wild birds do not protect, them from insects, _nothing will_! If you will watch a warbler collecting the insects out of the top of a seventy-foot forest oak, busy as a bee hour after hour, it will convince you that the birds do for the forests that which man with all his resources cannot accomplish. You will then realize that to this country every woodpecker, chickadee, titmouse, creeper and warbler is easily worth its weight in gold. The killing of any member of those groups of birds should be punished by a fine of twenty-five dollars. [Illustration: THE PURPLE MARTIN A Representative of the Swallow Family. A Great Insect-eater; one of the Most Valuable of all Birds to the Southern Cotton planter, and Northern farmer. Shot for ""Food"" in the South. Driven out of the North by the English Sparrow Pest.] THE BOB-WHITE.--And take the _Bob White Quail_, for example, and the weeds of the farm. To kill weeds costs money--hard cash that the farmer earns by toil. Does the farmer put forth strenuous efforts to protect the bird of all birds that does most to help him keep down the weeds? Far from it! All that the _average_ farmer thinks about the quail is of killing it, for a few ounces of meat on the table. It is fairly beyond question that of all birds that influence the fortunes of the farmers and fruit-growers of North America, the common quail, or bob white, is one of the most valuable. It stays on the farm all the year round. When insects are most numerous and busy, Bob White devotes to them his entire time. He cheerfully fights them, from sixteen to eighteen hours per day. When the insects are gone, he turns his attention to the weeds that are striving to seed down the fields for another year. Occasionally he gets a few grains of wheat that have been left on the ground by the reapers; but he does _no damage_. In California, where the valley quail once were very numerous, they sometimes consumed altogether too much wheat for the good of the farmers; but outside of California I believe such occurrences are unknown. Let us glance over the bob white's bill of fare: _Weed Seeds_.--One hundred and twenty-nine different weeds have been found to contribute to the quail's bill of fare. Crops and stomachs have been found crowded with rag-weed seeds, to the number of one thousand, while others had eaten as many seeds of crab-grass. A bird shot at Pine Brook, N.J., in October, 1902, had eaten five thousand seeds of green fox-tail grass, and one killed on Christmas Day at Kinsale, Va., had taken about ten thousand seeds of the pig-weed. (Elizabeth A. Reed.) In Bulletin No. 21, Biological Survey, it is calculated that if in Virginia and North Carolina there are four bob whites to every square mile, and each bird consumes one ounce of seed per day, the total destruction to weed seeds from September 1st to April 30th in those states alone will be 1,341 tons. In 1910 Mrs. Margaret Morse Nice, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass., finished and contributed to the Journal of Economic Entomology (Vol. III., No. 3) a masterful investigation of ""The Food of the Bob-White."" It should be in every library in this land. Mrs. Nice publishes the entire list of 129 species of weed seeds consumed by the quail,--and it looks like a rogue's gallery. Here is an astounding record, which proves once more that truth is stranger than fiction: * * * * * NUMBER OF SEEDS EATEN BY A BOB-WHITE IN ONE DAY Barnyard grass 2,500 Milkweed 770 Beggar ticks 1,400 Peppergrass 2,400 Black mustard 2,500 Pigweed 12,000 Burdock 600 Plantain 12,500 Crab grass 2,000 Rabbitsfoot clover 30,000 Curled dock 4,175 Round-headed bush clover 1,800 Dodder 1,560 Smartweed 2,250 Evening primrose 10,000 White vervain 18,750 Lamb's quarter 15,000 Water smartweed 2,000 NOTABLY BAD INSECTS EATEN BY THE BOB-WHITE (Prof. Judd and Mrs. Nice.)

Miscellaneous insects consumed by a laying hen quail, 1,532, of which 1,000 were grasshoppers; total weigh of the lot, 24.6 grams. ""F.M. Howard, of Beeville, Texas, wrote to the U.S. Bureau of Entomology, that the bob whites shot in his vicinity had their crops filled with the weevils. Another farmer reported his cotton fields full of quail, and an entire absence of weevils."" Texas and Georgia papers (please copy.) And yet, because of its few pitiful ounces of flesh, two million gunners and ten thousand lawmakers think of the quail _only as a bird that can be shot and eaten!_ Throughout a great portion of its former range, including New York and New Jersey, the species is surely and certainly on the verge of _total extinction_. And yet sportsmen gravely discuss the ""bag limit,"" and ""enforcement of the bag-limit law"" as a means of bringing back this almost vanished species! Such folly in grown men is very trying. _To my friend, the Epicure_:--The next time you regale a good appetite with blue points, terrapin stew, filet of sole and saddle of mutton, touched up here and there with the high lights of rare old sherry, rich claret and dry monopole, pause as the dead quail is laid before you, on a funeral pyre of toast, and consider this: ""Here lies the charred remains of the Farmer's Ally and Friend, poor Bob White. In life he devoured 145 different kinds of bad insects, and the seeds of 129 anathema weeds. For the smaller pests of the farm, he was the most marvelous engine of destruction that God ever put together of flesh and blood. He was good, beautiful and true; and his small life was blameless. And here he lies, dead; snatched away from his field of labor, and destroyed, in order that I may be tempted to dine three minutes longer, after I have already eaten to satiety."" Then go on, and finish Bob White. THE CASE OF THE ROBIN.--For a long time this bird has been slaughtered in the South for food, regardless of the agricultural interests of the North. No Southern gentleman ever shoots robins, or song birds of any kind, but the negroes and poor whites do it. The worst case of recent occurrence was the slaughter in the town of Pittsboro, North Carolina. It was in January, 1912. The Mayor of the town, Hon. Bennet Nooe, was away from home; and during a heavy fall of snow ""the robins came into the town in great numbers to feed upon the berries of the cedar trees. In order that the birds might be killed without restriction, the Board of Aldermen suspended the ordinance against the firing of guns in the town, and permitted the inhabitants to kill the robins."" A disgraceful carnival of slaughter immediately followed in which ""about all the male population"" participated. Regarding this, Mayor Nooe later on wrote to the editor of Bird Lore as follows: ""Hearing of this, on my return, I went to the Aldermen, _all of whom were guilty_, and told them that they and all others who were guilty would have to be fined. Three out of the five submitted and paid up, but they insisted that the ordinance be changed to read exactly as it is written here, with the exception that _all could shoot_ robins in the town until the first of March; whereupon I resigned, as was stated.""--(_Bird Lore,_ XIV, 2. p. 140.) The Mayor was quite right. The robin butchers of Pittsboro were not worthy to be governed by him. THE MEADOW LARK is one of the most valuable birds that frequent farming regions. Throughout the year insects make up 73 per cent of its food, weed-seeds 12 per cent, and grain only 5 per cent. During the insect season, insects constitute 90 per cent of its food. THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE is as valuable to man as it is beautiful. Its nest is the most wonderful example of bird architecture in our land. In May insects constitute 90 per cent of this bird's food. For the entire year, insects and other animal food make 83.4 per cent and vegetable matter 16.6 per cent. THE CROW BLACKBIRD feeds as follows, throughout the whole year: insects, 26.9 per cent; other animal food 3.4; corn 37.2; oats, 2.9; wheat, 4.8; other grain, 1.6; fruits, 5; weed seeds and mast 18.2! This report was based on the examination (by the Biological Survey) of 2,346 stomachs, and ""the charge that the blackbird is an habitual robber of birds' nests was disproved by the examinations."" (F.E.L. Beal.) FLYCATCHERS.--The high-water mark in insect-destruction by our birds is reached by the flycatchers,--dull-colored, modest-mannered little creatures that do their work so quietly you hardly notice them. All you see in your tree-tops is a two-foot flit or glide, now here and now there, as the leaves and high branches are combed of their insect life. Bulletin No. 44 of the Department of Agriculture gives the residuum of an exhausting examination of 3,398 warbler stomachs, from seventeen species of birds, and the result is: 94.99 per cent of insect food,--mostly bad insects, too,--and 5.01 per cent vegetable food. What more can any forester ask of a bird? [Illustration: THE ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK ""The Potato-bug Bird,"" Greatest Enemy of the Potato Beetles From the ""American Natural History""] THE SPARROWS.--All our sparrows are great consumers of weed seeds. Professor Beal has calculated the total quantity consumed in Iowa in one year,--in the days when sparrows were normally numerous,--at 1,750,000 pounds. THE AMERICAN GOLDFINCH as a weed destroyer has few equals. It makes a specialty of the seeds of the members of the Order Compositae, and is especially fond of the seeds of ragweed, thistles, wild lettuce and wild sunflower. But, small and beautiful as this bird is, there are hundreds of thousands of grown men in America who would shoot it and eat it if they dared! THE HAWKS AND OWLS.--Let no other state repeat the error that once was made in Pennsylvania when that state enacted in 1885, her now famous hawk-and-owl bounty law. In order to accomplish the wholesale destruction of her birds of prey, a law was passed providing for the payment of a bounty of fifty cents each for the scalps of hawks and owls. Immediately the slaughter began. In two years 180,000 scalps were brought in, and $90,000 were paid out for them. It was estimated that the saving to the farmers in poultry amounted to one dollar for each $1,205 paid out in bounties. The awakening came even more swiftly than the ornithologists expected. By the end of two years from the passage of ""the hawk law,"" the farmers found their fields and orchards thoroughly overrun by destructive rats, mice and insects, and they appealed to the legislature for the quick repeal of the law. With all possible haste this was brought about; but it was estimated by competent judges that in damages to their crops the hawk law cost the people of Pennsylvania nothing less than two million dollars. Moral: Don't make any laws providing for the destruction of hawks and owls until you have exact knowledge, and know in advance what the results will be. In the space at my disposal for this subject, it is impossible to treat our species of hawks and owls separately. The reader can find in the ""American Natural History"" fifteen pages of text, numerous illustrations and many figures elucidating this subject. Unfortunately Dr. Fisher's admirable work on ""The Hawks and Owls"" has long been out of print, and unobtainable. There are, however, a few observations that must be recorded here. Each bird of prey is a balanced equation. Each one, I think without a single exception, does _some_ damage, chiefly in the destruction of valuable wild birds. The value of the poultry destroyed by hawks and owls is very small in comparison with their killing of wild prey. _Many of the species do not touch domestic poultry_! At the same time, when a hawk of any kind, or an owl, sets to work deliberately and persistently to clean out a farmer's poultry yard, and is actually doing it, that farmer is justified in killing that bird. But, the _occasional_ loss of a broiler is not to be regarded as justification for a war of extermination on _all_ the hawks that fly! Individual wild-animal nuisances can occasionally become so exasperating as to justify the use of the gun,--when scarecrows fail; but in all such circumstances the greatest judgment, and much forbearance also, is desirable and necessary. The value of hawks and owls rests upon their perpetual warfare on the millions of destructive rats, mice, moles, shrews, weasels, rabbits and English sparrows that constantly prey upon what the farmer produces. On this point a few illustrations must be given. One of the most famous comes via Dr. Fisher, from one of the towers of the Smithsonian buildings, and relates to THE BARN OWL, (_Strix flammea_).--Two hundred pellets consisting of bones, hair and feathers from one nesting pair of these birds were collected, and found to contain 454 skulls, of which 225 were of meadow mice, 179 of house mice, 2 of pine mice, 20 were of rats, 6 of jumping mice, 20 were from shrews, 1 was of a mole and 1 a vesper sparrow. _One_ bird, and 453 noxious mammals! Compare this with the record of any cat on earth. Anything that the barn owl wants from me, or from any farmer, should at once be offered to it, on a silver tray. This bird is often called the Monkey-Faced Owl, and it should be called the Farmer's-Friend Owl. THE LONG-EARED OWL, (_Asio wilsonianus_) has practically the same kind of a record as the barn owl,--scores of mice, rats and shrews destroyed, and only an occasional small bird. Its nearest relative, the _Short-eared Owl (A. accipitrinus_) may be described in the same words. [Illustration: THE BARN OWL Wonderfully Destructive of Rats and Mice, and Almost Never Touches Birds] The GREAT HORNED OWL fills us with conflicting passions. For the long list of dead rats and mice, pocket gophers, skunks, and weasels to his credit, we think well of him, and wish his prosperity. For the song-birds, ruffed grouse, quail, other game birds, domestic poultry, squirrels, chipmunks and hares that he kills, we hate him, and would cheerfully wring his neck, wearing gauntlets. He does an unusual amount of good, and a terrible amount of harm. It is impossible to strike a balance for him, and determine with mathematical accuracy whether he should be shot or permitted to live. At all events, whenever _Bubo_ comes up for trial, we must give the feathered devil his due. The names ""CHICKEN HAWK or HEN HAWK"" as applied usually refer to the RED-SHOULDERED or RED-TAILED species. Neither of these is really very destructive to poultry, but both are very destructive to mice, rats and other pestiferous creatures. Both are large, showy birds, not so very swift in flight, and rather easy to approach. Neither of them should be destroyed,--not even though they do, once in a great while, take a chicken or wild bird. They pay for them, four times over, by rat-killing. Mr. J. Alden Loring states that he once knew a pair of red-shouldered hawks to nest within fifty rods of a poultry farm on which there were 800 young chickens and 400 ducks, not one of which was taken. (See the American Natural History, pages 229-30.) HAWKS THAT SHOULD BE DESTROYED.--There are two small, fierce, daring, swift-winged hawks both of which are so very destructive that they deserve to be shot whenever possible. They are COOPER'S HAWK _(Accipiter cooperi_) and the SHARP-SHINNED HAWK _(A. velox_). They are closely related, and look much alike, but the former has a rounded tail and the latter a square one. In killing them, _please do not kill any other hawk by mistake_; and if you do not positively recognize the bird, don't shoot. THE GOSHAWK is a bad one, and so is the PEREGRINE FALCON, or DUCK HAWK. Both deserve death, but they are so rare that we need not take them into account. Some of the hawks and owls are very destructive to song-birds, and members of the grouse family. In 159 stomachs of sharp-shinned hawks, 99 contained song-birds and woodpeckers. In 133 stomachs of Cooper's hawks, 34 contained poultry or game birds, and 52 contained other birds. The game birds included 8 quail, 1 ruffed grouse and 5 pigeons. THE WOODPECKERS.[I]--These birds are the natural guardians of the trees. If we had enough of them, our forests would be fairly safe from insect pests. Of the six or seven North American species that are of the most importance to our forests, the DOWNY WOODPECKER, (_Dryobates pubescens_) is accorded first rank. It is one of the smallest species. The contents of 140 stomachs consisted of 74 per cent insects, 25 per cent vegetable matter and 1 per cent sand. The insects were ants, beetles, bugs, flies, caterpillars, grasshoppers and a few spiders. [Footnote I: The reader is advised to consult Prof. F.E.L. Beale's admirable report on ""The Food of Woodpeckers,"" Bulletin No. 7, U.S. Department of Agriculture.] THE HAIRY WOODPECKER, (_Dryobates villosus_), a very close relation of the preceding species, is also small, and his food supply is as follows: insects, 68 per cent, vegetable matter 31, mineral 1. THE GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER, (_Colaptes auratus_), is the largest and handsomest of all the woodpeckers that we really see in evidence. The Pileated is one of the largest, but we never see it. This bird makes a specialty of ants, of which it devours immense numbers. Its food is 56 per cent animal matter (three-fourths of which is ants), 39 per cent is vegetable matter, and 5 per cent mineral matter. THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER is a serious fruit-eater, and many complaints have been lodged against him. Exactly one-half his food supply consists of vegetable matter, chiefly wild berries, acorns, beechnuts, and the seeds of wild shrubs and weeds. We may infer that about one-tenth of his food, in summer and fall, consists of cultivated fruit and berries. His proportion of cultivated foods is entirely too small to justify any one in destroying this species. In view of the prevalence of insect pests in the state of New York, I have spent hours in trying to devise a practical plan for making woodpeckers about ten times more numerous than they now are. Contributions to this problem will be thankfully received. Yes; we _do_ put out pork fat and suet in winter, quantities of it; but I grieve to say that to-day in the Zoological Park there is not more than one woodpecker for every ten that were there twelve years ago. Where have they gone? Only one answer is possible. They have been shot and eaten, by the guerrillas of destruction. [Illustration: GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER A Bird of Great Value to Orchards and Forests, now Rapidly Disappearing, Undoubtedly Through Slaughter as ""Food""] Surely no man of intelligence needs to be told to protect woodpeckers to the utmost, and to _feed them in winter_. Nail up fat pork, or large chunks of suet, on the south sides of conspicuous trees, and encourage the woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees and titmice to remain in your woods through the long and dreary winter. THE ENGLISH SPARROW is a nuisance and a pest, because it drives away from the house and the orchard the house wren, bluebird, phoebe, purple martin and swallow, any one of which is more valuable to man than a thousand English sparrows. I never yet have seen one of the pest sparrows catch an insect, but Chief Forester Merkel says that he has seen one catching and eating small moths. There is one place in the country where English sparrows have not yet come; and whenever they do appear there, they will meet a hostile reception. I shall kill every one that comes,--for the sake of retaining the wrens, catbirds, phoebes and thrushes that now literally make home happy for my family. A good way to discourage sparrows is to shoot them en masse when they are feeding on road refuse, such as the white-throated, white-crowned and other sparrows never touch. Persistent destruction of their nests will check the nuisance. THE SHORE BIRDS.--Who is there who thinks of the shore-birds as being directly beneficial to man by reason of their food habits? I warrant not more than one man in every ten thousand! We think of them only as possible ""food."" The amount of actual cash value benefit that the shore-birds confer upon man through the destruction of bad things is, in comparison with the number of birds, enormous. The Department of Agriculture never publishes and circulates anything that has already been published, no matter how valuable to the public at large. Our rules are different. Because I know that many of the people of our country need the information, I am going to reprint here, as an object lesson and a warning, the whole of the Biological Survey's valuable and timely circular No. 79, issued April 11, 1911, and written by Prof. W.L. McAtee. It should open the eyes of the American people to two things: the economic value of these birds, and the fact that they are everywhere far on the road toward extermination! * * * * * OUR VANISHING SHOREBIRDS By Prof. W.L. McAtee The term shorebird is applied to a group of long-legged, slender-billed, and usually plainly colored birds belonging to the order Limicolae. More than sixty species of them occur in North America. True to their name they frequent the shores of all bodies of water, large and small, but many of them are equally at home on plains and prairies. Throughout the eastern United States shorebirds are fast vanishing. While formerly numerous species swarmed along the Atlantic coast and in the prairie regions, many of them have been so reduced that extermination seems imminent. The black-bellied plover or beetlehead, which occurred along the Atlantic seaboard in great numbers years ago, is now seen only as a straggler. The golden plover, once exceedingly abundant east of the Great Plains, is now rare. Vast hordes of long-billed dowitchers formerly wintered in Louisiana; now they occur only in infrequent flocks of a half dozen or less. The Eskimo curlew within the last decade has probably been exterminated and the other curlews greatly reduced. In fact, all the larger species of shorebirds have suffered severely. So adverse to shorebirds are present conditions that the wonder is that any escape. In both fall and spring they are shot along the whole route of their migration north and south. Their habit of decoying readily and persistently, coming back in flocks to the decoys again and again, in spite of murderous volleys, greatly lessens their chances of escape. The breeding grounds of some of the species in the United States and Canada have become greatly restricted by the extension of agriculture, and their winter ranges in South America have probably been restricted in the same way. Unfortunately, shorebirds lay fewer eggs than any of the other species generally termed game birds. They deposit only three or four eggs, and hatch only one brood yearly. Nor are they in any wise immune from the great mortality known to prevail among the smaller birds. Their eggs and young are constantly preyed upon during the breeding season by crows, gulls, and jaegers, and the far northern country to which so many of them resort to nest is subject to sudden cold storms, which kill many of the young. In the more temperate climate of the United States small birds, in general, do not bring up more than one young bird for every two eggs laid. Sometimes the proportion of loss is much greater, actual count revealing a destruction of 70 to 80 per cent of nests and eggs. Shorebirds, with sets of three or four eggs, probably do not on the average rear more than two young for each breeding pair. It is not surprising, therefore, that birds of this family, with their limited powers of reproduction, melt away under the relentless warfare waged upon them. Until recent years shorebirds have had almost no protection. Thus, the species most in need of stringent protection have really had the least. No useful birds which lay only three or four eggs should be retained on the list of game birds. The shorebirds should be relieved from persecution, and if we desire to save from extermination a majority of the species, action must be prompt. The protection of shorebirds need not be based solely on esthetic or sentimental grounds, for few groups of birds more thoroughly deserve protection from an economic standpoint. Shorebirds perform an important service by their inroads upon mosquitoes, some of which play so conspicuous a part in the dissemination of diseases. Thus, nine species are known to feed upon mosquitoes, and hundreds of the larvae or ""wigglers"" were found in several stomachs. Fifty-three per cent of the food of twenty-eight northern phalaropes from one locality consisted of mosquito larvae. The insects eaten include the salt-marsh mosquito (_Aedes sollicitans_), for the suppression of which the State of New Jersey has gone to great expense. The nine species of shorebirds known to eat mosquitoes are: Northern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_). Semipalmated sandpiper (_Ereunetes pusillus_). Wilson phalarope (_Steganopus tricolor_). Stilt sandpiper (_Micropalama himantopus_). Killdeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_). Pectoral sandpiper (_Pisobia maculata_). Semipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_). Baird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_). Least sandpiper (_Pisobia minutilla_). Cattle and other live stock also are seriously molested by mosquitoes as well as by another set of pests, the horse-flies. Adults and larvae of these flies have been found in the stomachs of the dowitcher, the pectoral sandpiper, the hudsonian godwit, and the killdeer. Two species of shorebirds, the killdeer and upland plover, still further befriend cattle by devouring the North American fever tick. Among other fly larvae consumed are those of the crane flies (leather-jackets) devoured by the following species: Northern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_). Pectoral sandpiper (_Pisobia maculata_). Wilson phalarope (_Steganopus tricolor_). Baird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_). Woodcock (_Philohela minor_). Upland plover (_Bartramia longicauda_). Jacksnipe (_Gallinago delicata_). Killdeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_). Crane-fly larvae are frequently seriously destructive locally in grass and wheat fields. Among their numerous bird enemies, shorebirds rank high. Another group of insects of which the shorebirds are very fond is grasshoppers. Severe local infestations of grasshoppers, frequently involving the destruction of many acres of corn, cotton, and other crops, are by no means exceptional. Aughey found twenty-three species of shorebirds feeding on Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska, some of them consuming large numbers, as shown below. 9 killdeer stomachs contained an average of 28 locusts each. 11 semipalmated plover stomachs contained an average of 38 locusts each. 16 mountain plover stomachs contained an average of 45 locusts each. 11 jacksnipe stomachs contained an average of 37 locusts each. 22 upland plover stomachs contained an average of 36 locusts each. 10 long-billed curlew stomachs contained an average of 48 locusts each. [Illustration: TWO MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OF SHORE-BIRDS The Killdeer Plover The Jacksnipe These, with 28 other species, destroy enormous numbers of locusts, grasshoppers, crane-fly larvae, mosquito larvae, army-worms, cut-worms, cotton-worms, boll-weevils, curculios, wire-worms and clover-leaf weevils. It is insane folly to shoot any birds that do such work! Many species of the shore-birds are rapidly being exterminated.] Even under ordinary conditions grasshoppers are a staple food of many members of the shorebird family, and the following species are known to feed on them: Northern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_). Avocet (_Recurvirostra americana_). Black-necked stilt (_Himantopus mexicanus_). Woodcock (_Philohela minor_). Jacksnipe (_Gallinago delicata_). Dowitcher (_Macrorhamphus griseus_). Robin snipe (_Tringa canutus_). White-rumped sandpiper (_Pisobia fuscicollis_). Baird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_). Least sandpiper (_Pisobia minutilla_). Buff-breasted sandpiper (_Tryngites subruficollis_). Spotted sandpiper (_Actitis macularia_). Long-billed curlew (_Numenius americanus_). Black-bellied plover (_Squatarola squatarola_). Golden plover (_Charadrius dominicus_). Killdeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_). Semipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_). Marbled godwit _(Limosa fedoa)_. Ringed plover _(Aegialitis hiaticula)_. Yellowlegs _(Totanus flavipes)_. Mountain plover _(Podasocys montanus)_. Solitary sandpiper _(Helodromas solitarius)_. Turnstone _(Arenaria interpres)_. Upland plover _(Bartramia longicauda)_. Shorebirds are fond of other insect pests of forage and grain crops, including the army worm, which is known to be eaten by the killdeer and spotted sandpiper; also cutworms, among whose enemies are the avocet, woodcock, pectoral and Baird sandpipers, upland plover, and killdeer. Two caterpillar enemies of cotton, the cotton worm and the cotton cutworm, are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer. The latter bird feeds also on caterpillars of the genus _Phlegethontius_, which includes, the tobacco and tomato worms. The principal farm crops have many destructive beetle enemies also, and some of these are eagerly eaten by shorebirds. The boll weevil and clover-leaf weevil are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer, the rice weevil by the killdeer, the cowpea weevil by the upland plover, and the clover-root curculio by the following species of shorebirds: Northern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_. White-rumped sandpiper _(Pisobia fuscicollis)_. Pectoral sandpiper _(Pisobia maculata_). Upland plover _(Bartramia longicauda)_. Baird sandpiper _(Pisobia bairdi)_. Killdeer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_. The last two eat also other weevils which attack cotton, grapes and sugar beets. Bill-bugs, which often do considerable damage to corn, seem to be favorite food of some of the shorebirds. They are eaten by the Wilson phalarope, avocet, black-necked stilt, pectoral sandpiper, killdeer, and upland plover. They are an important element of the latter bird's diet, and no fewer than eight species of them have been found in its food. Wireworms and their adult forms, click beetles, are devoured by the northern phalarope, woodcock, jacksnipe, pectoral sandpiper, killdeer, and upland plover. The last three feed also on the southern corn leaf-beetle and the last two upon the grapevine colaspis. Other shorebirds that eat leaf-beetles are the Wilson phalarope and dowitcher. Crayfishes, which are a pest in rice and corn fields in the South and which injure levees, are favorite food of the black-necked stilt, and several other shorebirds feed upon them, notably the jacksnipe, robin snipe, spotted sandpiper, upland plover, and killdeer. Thus it is evident that shorebirds render important aid by devouring the enemies of farm crops and in other ways, and their services are appreciated by those who have observed the birds in the field. Thus W.A. Clark, of Corpus Christi, Tex., reports that upland plovers are industrious in following the plow and in eating the grubs that destroy garden stuff, corn, and cotton crops. H.W. Tinkham, of Fall River, Mass., says of the spotted sandpiper: ""Three pairs nested in a young orchard behind my house and adjacent to my garden. I did not see them once go to the shore for food (shore about 1,500 feet away), but I did see them many times make faithful search of my garden for cutworms, spotted squash bugs, and green flies. Cutworms and cabbage worms were their special prey. After the young could fly, they still kept at work in my garden, and showed no inclination to go to the shore until about August 15th. They and a flock of quails just over the wall helped me wonderfully."" In the uncultivated parts of their range also, shorebirds search out and destroy many creatures that are detrimental to man's interest. Several species prey upon the predaceous diving beetles _(Dytiscidae),_ which are a nuisance in fish hatcheries and which destroy many insects, the natural food of fishes. The birds now known to take these beetles are: Northern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_. Dowitcher _(Macrorhamphus griseus)_. Wilson phalarope _(Steganopus tricolor)_. Robin snipe _(Tringa canutus)_. Avocet _(Recurvirostra americana)_. Pectoral sandpiper _(Pisobia maculata)_. Black-necked stilt _(Himantopus mexicanus_). Red-backed sandpiper _(Pelidna alpina sakhalina)_. Jacksnipe _(Gallinago delicata)_. Kill deer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_. Large numbers of marine worms of the genus _Nereis_, which prey upon oysters, are eaten by shorebirds. These worms are common on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and are eaten by shorebirds wherever they occur. It is not uncommon to find that from 100 to 250 of them have been eaten at one meal. The birds known to feed upon them are: Northern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_. White-rumped sandpiper _(Pisobia fuscicollis)_. Dowitcher _(Macrorhamphus griseus_). Stilt sandpiper _(Micropalama himantopus)_. Red-backed sandpiper _(Pelidna alpina sakhalina)_. Robin snipe _(Tringa canutus)_. Purple sandpiper _(Arquatella maritima_). Killdeer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_. The economic record of the shorebirds deserves nothing but praise. These birds injure no crop, but on the contrary feed upon many of the worst enemies of agriculture. It is worth recalling that their diet includes such pests as the Rocky Mountain locust and other injurious grasshoppers, the army worm, cutworms, cabbage worms, cotton worm, cotton cutworm, boll weevil, clover leaf weevil, clover root curculio, rice weevil, corn bill-bugs, wireworms, corn leaf-beetles, cucumber beetles, white grubs, and such foes of stock as the Texas fever tick, horseflies, and mosquitoes. Their warfare on crayfishes must not be overlooked, nor must we forget the more personal debt of gratitude we owe them for preying upon mosquitoes. They are the most important bird enemies of these pests known to us. Shorebirds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast numbers is left. Their limited powers of reproduction, coupled with the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their increase slow, and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination. In the way of protection a beginning has been made, and a continuous close season until 1915 has been established for the following birds: The killdeer, in Massachusetts and Louisiana; the upland plover, in Massachusetts, and Vermont; and the piping plover in Massachusetts. But, considering the needs and value of these birds, this modicum of protection is small indeed. The above-named species are not the only ones that should be exempt from persecution, for all the shorebirds of the United States are in great need of better protection. They should be protected, first, to save them from the danger of extermination, and, second, because of their economic importance. So great, indeed, is their economic value, that their retention on the game list and their destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture.--(End of the circular.) * * * * * The following appeared in the _Zoological Society Bulletin_, for January, 1909, from Richard Walter Tomalin, of Sydney, N.S.W.: ""In the subdistricts of Robertson and Kangaloon in the Illawarra district of New South Wales, what ten years ago was a waving mass of English cocksfoot and rye grass, which had been put in gradually as the dense vine scrub was felled and burnt off, is now a barren desert, and nine families out of every ten which were renting properties have been compelled to leave the district and take up other lands. This is through the grubs having eaten out the grass by the roots. Ploughing proved to be useless, as the grubs ate out the grass just the same. Whilst there recently I was informed that it took three years from the time the grubs were first seen until to-day, to accomplish this complete devastation;. in other words, three years ago the grubs began work in the beautiful country of green mountains and running streams. ""The birds had all been ruthlessly shot and destroyed in that district, and I was amazed at the absence of bird life. The two sub-districts I have mentioned have an area of about thirty square miles, and form a table-land about 1200 feet above sea level."" The same kind of common sense that teaches men to go in when it rains, and keep out of fiery furnaces, teaches us that as a business proposition it is to man's interest to protect the birds. Make them plentiful and keep them so. When we strike the birds, we hurt ourselves. The protection of our insect-eating and seed-eating birds is a cash proposition,--protect or pay. Were I a farmer, no gun ever should be fired on my premises at any bird save the English sparrow and the three bad hawks. Any man who would kill my friend Bob White I would treat as an enemy. The man who would shoot and eat any of the song-birds, woodpeckers, or shorebirds that worked for me, I would surely molest. _Every farmer should post every foot of his lands, cultivated and not cultivated_. The farmer who does not do so is his own enemy; and he needs a guardian. At this stage of wild life extermination, it is impossible to make our bird-protection laws too strict, or too far-reaching. The remnant of our birds should be protected, with clubs and guns if necessary. All our shore birds should be accorded a ten-year close season. Don't ask the gunners whether they will _agree_ to it or not. _Of course they will not agree to it,--never_! But our duty is clear,--to go ahead and _do it_! * * * * * CHAPTER XXIV GAME AND AGRICULTURE; AND DEER AS A FOOD SUPPLY As a state and county asset, the white-tailed deer contains possibilities that as yet seem to be ignored by the American people as a whole. It is quite time to consider that persistent, prolific and toothsome animal. The proposition that large herds of horned game can not becomingly roam at will over farms and vineyards worth one hundred dollars per acre, affords little room for argument. Generally speaking, there is but one country in the world that breaks this well-nigh universal rule; and that country is India. On the plains between and adjacent to the Ganges and the Jumna, for two thousand years herds of black-buck, or sasin antelope, have roamed over cultivated fields so thickly garnished with human beings that to-day the rifle-shooting sportsman stands in hourly peril of bagging a five-hundred-rupee native every time he fires at an antelope. Wherever rich agricultural lands exist, the big game must give way,--_from those lands_. To-day the bison could not survive in Iowa, eastern Nebraska or eastern Kansas, any longer than a Shawnee Indian would last on the Bowery. It was foredoomed that the elk, deer, bear and wild turkey should vanish from the rich farming regions of the East and the middle West. To-day in British East Africa lions are being hunted with dogs and shot wholesale, because they are a pest to the settlers and to the surviving herds of big game. At the same time, the settlers who are striving to wrest the fertile plains of B.E.A, from the domain of savagery declare that the African buffalo, the zebra, the kongoni and the elephant are public nuisances that must be suppressed by the rifle. Even the most ardent friend of wild life must admit that when a settler has laboriously fenced his fields, and plowed and sowed, only to have his whole crop ruined in one night by a herd of fence-breaking zebras, the event is sufficient to abrade the nerves of the party most in interest. While I take no stock in stories of dozens of ""rogue"" elephants that require treatment with the rifle, and of grown men being imperiled by savage gazelles, we admit that there are times when wild animals can make nuisances of themselves. Let us consider that subject now. WILD ANIMAL NUISANCES.--Complaints have come to me, at various times, of great destruction of lambs by eagles; of trout by blue herons; of crops (on Long Island) by deer; of pears destroyed by birds, and of valuable park trees by beavers that chop down trees not wisely but too well. I do not, however, include in this category any cherries eaten by robins, or orioles, or jays; for they are of too small importance to consider in this court. [Illustration: A FOOD SUPPLY OF WHITE-TAILED DEER The Killing of the Does was Wrong] To meet the legitimate demands for the abatement of unbearable wild-animal nuisances, I recommend the enactment of a law similar to Section 158 of the Game laws of New York, which provides for the safe and legitimate abatement of unbearable wild creatures as follows: Section 158. _Power to Take Birds and Quadrupeds_. In the event that any species of birds protected by the provisions of section two hundred and nineteen of this article, or quadrupeds protected by law, shall at any time, in any locality, become destructive of private or public property, the commission shall have power in its discretion to direct any game protector, or issue a permit to any citizen of the state, to take such species of birds or quadrupeds and dispose of the same in such manner as the commission may provide. Such permit shall expire within four months after the date of issuance. This measure should be adopted by every state that is troubled by too many, or too aggressive, wild mammals or birds. But to return to the subject of big game and farming. We do not complain of the disappearance of the bison, elk, deer and bear from the farms of the United States and Canada. The passing of the big game from all such regions follows the advance of real civilization, just so surely and certainly as night follows day. But this vast land of ours is not wholly composed of rich agricultural lands; not by any means. There are millions of acres of forest lands, good, bad and indifferent, worth from nothing per acre up to one hundred dollars or more. There are millions of acres of rocky, brush-covered mountains and hills, wholly unsuited to agriculture, or even horticulture. There are other millions of acres of arid plains and arboreal deserts, on which nothing but thirst-proof animals can live and thrive. The South contains vast pine forests and cypress swamps, millions of acres of them, of which the average northerner knows less than nothing. We can not stop long enough to look it up, but from the green color on our national map that betokens the forest reserves, and from our own personal knowledge of the deserts, swamps, barrens and rocks that we have seen, we make the estimate that _fully one-third_ of the total area of the United States is incapable of supporting the husbandman who depends for his existence upon tillage of the soil. People may talk and write about ""dry farming"" all they please, but I wish to observe that from Dry-Farming to Success is a long shot, with many limbs in the way. When it rains sufficiently, dry farming is a success; but otherwise it is not; and we heartily wish it were otherwise. The logical conclusion of our land that is utterly unfit for agriculture is a great area of land available for occupancy by valuable wild animals. Every year the people of the United States are wasting uncountable millions of pounds of venison, because we are neglecting our opportunities for producing it practically without cost. Imagine for a moment bestowing upon land owners the ability to stock with white-tailed and Indian sambar deer all the wild lands of the United States that are suitable for those species, and permitting only bucks over one year of age to be shot. With the does even reasonably protected, the numerical results in annual pounds of good edible flesh fairly challenges the imagination. About six years ago, Mr. C.C. Worthington's deer, in his fenced park, at Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania, became so numerous and so burdensome that he opened his fences and permitted about one thousand head to go free. We are losing each year a very large and valuable asset in the intangible form of a million hardy deer that we might have raised but did not! Our vast domains of wooded mountains, hills and valleys lie practically untenanted by big game, save in a few exceptional spots. We lose because we are lawless. We lose because we are too improvident to conserve large forms of wild life unless we are compelled to do so by the stern edict of the law! The law-breakers, the game-hogs, the conscienceless doe-and-fawn slayers are everywhere! Ten per cent of all the grown men now in the United States are to-day poachers, thieves and law-breakers, or else they are liable to become so to-morrow. If you doubt it, try risking your new umbrella unprotected in the next mixed company of one hundred men that you encounter, in such a situation that it will be easy to ""get away"" with it. We could raise two million deer each year on our empty wild lands; but without fences it would take half a million real game-wardens, on duty from dawn until dark, to protect them from destructive slaughter. At present our land of liberty contains only 9,354 game wardens.[J] The states that contain the greatest areas of wild lands naturally lack in population and in tax funds, and not one such state can afford to put into the field even half enough salaried game wardens to really protect her game from surreptitious slaughter. The surplus of ""personal liberty"" in this liberty-cursed land is a curse to the big game. The average frontiersman never will admit the divine right of kings, but he does ardently believe in the divine right of settlers,--to reach out and take any of the products of Nature that they happen to fancy. [Footnote J: Of this force, there are only 1,200 salaried wardens. The most of those who serve without salaries naturally render but little continuous or regular service.] WILD MEAT AS A FOOD SUPPLY.--We hear much these days about the high cost of living, but thus far we have made no move to mend the situation. With coal going straight up to ten dollars per ton, beef going up to fifteen dollars per hundred on the hoof and wheat and hay going-up--heaven alone knows where, it is time for all Americans who are not rich to arouse and take thought for the morrow. _What are we going to do about it_? The tariff on the coarser necessities of life is now booked to come down; but what about the fresh meat supply? I desire to point out that between Bangor and San Diego and from Key West to Bellingham, our country contains millions of acres of wild, practically uninhabited forests, rough foot-hills, bad-lands and mountains that could produce two million deer each year, without deducting $50,000 a year from the wealth of the country. I grant that in the total number of deer that would be necessary to produce two million deer per annum, the farms situated on the edges of forests, and actually within the forests, would suffer somewhat from the depredations of those deer. As I will presently show by documentary records, every one of those individual damages that exceeds two dollars in value could be compensated in cash, and afterward leave on the credit side of the deer account an enormous annual balance. Stop for a moment, you enterprising and restless men and women who travel all over the United States, and think of the illimitable miles of unbroken forest that you have looked upon from your Pullman windows in the East, in the South, in the West and in southern Canada. Recall the wooded mountains of the Appalachian system, the White Mountain region, the pine forests of the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf States, the forests of Tennessee, Arkansas and southern Missouri; of northern Minnesota, and every state of the Rocky Mountain region. Then, think of the silent and untouched forests of the Pacific Coast and tell me whether you think five million deer scattered through all those forests would make any visible impression upon them. That would be only about twenty-five times as many as are there now! I think the forests would not be over populated; and they would produce _two million killable deer each year_! Last year, 11,000 deer were forced down out of their hiding places in the Rocky Mountains, and were killed in Montana. Even the natives had not dreamed there were so many available; and they were slaughtered not wisely but too ill. It is not right that six members of one family should ""hog"" twelve deer in one season. At present no deer supply can stand such slaughter. Assuming that the people of the United States _could_ be educated into the idea of so conserving deer that they could draw two million head per year from the general stock, what would it be worth? It is not very difficult to estimate the value of a deer, when the whole animal can be utilized. In various portions of the United States, deer vary in size, but I shall take all this into account, and try to strike a fair average. In some sections, where deer are large and heavy, a full-grown buck is easily worth twenty-five dollars. Let him who doubts it, try to replace those generous pounds of flesh with purchased beef and mutton and veal, and see how far twenty-five dollars will go toward it. Every man who is a householder knows full well how little meat one dollar will buy at this time. I think that throughout the United States as a whole every full-grown deer, male or female contains on an average ten dollars worth of good meat. I know of one large preserve which annually sells its surplus of deer at that price, wholesale, to dealers; and in New York City (doubtless in many other cities, also) venison often has sold in the market at one dollar per pound! Two million deer at $10 each mean $20,000,000. The licenses for the killing of two million deer should cost one million men one dollar each; and that would pay 1,666 new game wardens each fifty dollars per month, all the year round. The damages that would need to be paid to farmers, on account of crops injured by deer, would be so small that each county could take care of its own cases, from its own treasury, as is done in the State of Vermont. There are certain essentials to the realization of a dream of two million deer per year that are absolutely required. They are neither obscure nor impossible. Each state and each county proposing to stock its vacant woods with deer must resolutely educate its own people in the necessity of playing fair about the killing of deer, and giving every man and every deer a square deal. This is _not_ impossible! Not as a general thing, even though it may be so in some specially lawless communities. If the _leading men_ of the state and the county will take this matter seriously in hand, it can be done in two years' time. The American people are not insensible to appeals to reason, when those appeals are made by their own ""home folks."" The governors, senators, assemblymen, judges, mayors and justices of the peace could, _if they would_, make a campaign of education and appeal that would result in the creation of an immense volume of free wild food in every state that possesses wild lands. When the shoe of Necessity pinches the People hard enough, remember the possibilities in deer. [Illustration: WHITE-TAILED DEER If Honestly and Intelligently Conserved, this Species could be made to Produce on our Wild Lands Two Million Deer per annum, as a new Food Supply From the ""American Natural History""] The best wild animal to furnish a serious food supply is the white-tailed deer. This is because of its persistence and fertility. The elk is too large for general use. An elk carcass can not be carried on a horse; it is impossible to get a sled or a wagon to where it lies; and so, fully half of it usually is wasted! The mule deer is good for the Rocky Mountains, and can live where the white-tail can not; but it is _too easy to shoot_! The Columbian black-tail is the natural species for the forests of the Pacific states; but it is a trifle small in size. THE EXAMPLE OF VERMONT.--In order to show that all the above is not based on empty theory,--regarding the stocking of forests with deer, their wonderful powers of increase, and the practical handling of the damage question,--let us take the experience and the fine example of Vermont. In April, 1875, a few sportsmen of Rutland, of whom the late Henry W. Cheney was one, procured in the Adirondacks thirteen white-tailed deer, six bucks and seven does. These were liberated in a forest six miles from Rutland, and beyond being protected from slaughter, they were left to shift for themselves. They increased, slowly at first, then rapidly, and by 1897, they had become so numerous that it seemed right to have a short annual open season, and kill a few. From first to last, many of those deer have been killed contrary to law. In 1904-5, it was known that 294 head were destroyed in that way; and undoubtedly there were others that were not reported.

DAMAGES TO CROPS BY DEER.--For several years past, the various counties of Vermont have been paying farmers for damages inflicted upon their crops by deer. Clearly, it is more just that counties should settle these damages than that they should be paid from the state treasury, because the counties paying damages have large compensation in the value of the deer killed each year. The hunting appears to be open to all persons who hold licenses from the state. In order that the public at large may know the cost of the Vermont system, I offer the following digest compiled from the last biennial report of the State Fish and Game Commissioner: DAMAGES PAID FOR DEER DEPREDATIONS IN VERMONT DURING TWO YEARS Total damages paid from June 8, 1908, to June 22, 1910 $4,865.98 Total number of claims paid 311 Total number of claims under $5 80 Number between $5 and $10, inclusive 102 Number over $25 and under $51 23 Number between $50 and $100 11 Number in excess of $100 4 Number in excess of $200 1 Largest claim paid $326.50 VALUE OF WHITE-TAILED DEER.--Having noted the fact that in two years (1908-9), the people of Vermont paid out $4,865 in compensation for damages inflicted by deer, it is of interest to determine whether that money was wisely expended. In other words, did it pay? We have seen that in the years 1908 and 9, the people of Vermont killed, legally and illegally, and converted to use, 7,186 deer. This does not include the deer killed by dogs and by accidents. Regarding the value of a full-grown deer, it must be remembered that much depends upon the locality of the carcass. In New York or Pittsburg or Chicago, a whole deer is worth, at wholesale, at least twenty-five dollars. In Vermont, where deer are plentiful, they are worth a less sum. I think that fifteen dollars would be a fair figure,--at least low enough! Even when computed at fifteen dollars per carcass, those deer were worth to the people of Vermont $107,790. It would seem, therefore, that the soundness of Vermont's policy leaves no room for argument; and we hope that other states, and also private individuals, will profit by Vermont's very successful experiment in bringing back the deer to her forests, and in increasing the food supply of her people. KILLING FEMALE DEER.--To say one word on this subject which might by any possibility be construed as favoring it, is like juggling with a lighted torch over a barrel of gunpowder. Already, in Pennsylvania at least one gentleman has appeared anxious to represent me as favoring the killing of does, which in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of every thousand I distinctly and emphatically do not. The slaughter of female hoofed game animals is necessarily destructive and reprehensible, and not one man out of every ten thousand in this country ever will see the place and time wherein the opposite is true. At present there are just two places in America, and I think only two, wherein there exists the slightest exception on this point. The state of Vermont is becoming overstocked with deer, and the females have in _some_ counties (not in all), become so tame and destructive in orchards, gardens and farm crops as to constitute a great annoyance. For this reason, the experiment is being made of permitting does to be killed under license, until their number is somewhat reduced. The first returns from this trial have now come in, from the county game wardens of Vermont to the state game warden. Mr. John W. Titcomb. I will quote the gist of the opinion of each. The State Commissioner says: ""This law should remain in force at least until there is some indication of a decrease in the number of deer."" Warden W.H. Taft (Addison County) says: ""The killing of does I believe did away with a good many of these tame deer that cause most of the damage to farmers' crops."" Harry Chase (Bennington County) says the doe-killing law is ""a good law, and I sincerely trust it will not be repealed."" Warden Hayward of Rutland County says: ""The majority of the farmers in this county are in favor of repealing the doe law.... A great many does and young deer (almost fawns) were killed in this county during the hunting season of 1909."" R.W. Wheeler, of Rutland County says: ""Have the doe law repealed! We don't need it!"" H.J. Parcher of Washington County finds that the does did more damage to the crops than the bucks, and he thinks the doe law is ""a just one."" R.L. Frost, of Windham County, judicially concludes that ""the law allowing does to be killed should remain in force one or two seasons more."" C.S Parker, of Orleans County, says his county is not overstocked with deer, and he favors a special act for his county, to protect females. A summary of the testimony of the wardens is easily made. When deer are too plentiful, and the over-tame does become a public nuisance too great to be endured, the number should be reduced by regular shooting in the open season; but, As soon as the proper balance of deer life has been restored, protect the does once more. The pursuit of this policy is safe and sane, provided it can be wrought out without the influence of selfishness, and reckless disregard for the rights of the next generation. On the whole, its handling is like playing with fire, and I think there are very, very few states on this earth wherein it would be wise or safe to try it. As a wise friend once remarked to me, ""Give some men a hinch, and they'll always try to take a hell."" In Vermont, however, the situation is kept so well in hand we may be sure that at the right moment the law providing for the decrease of the number of does will be repealed. HIPPOPOTAMI AND ANTELOPES.--Last year a bill was introduced in the lower House of Congress proposing to provide funds for the introduction into certain southern states of various animals from Africa, especially hippopotami and African antelopes. The former were proposed partly for the purpose of ridding navigation of the water hyacinths that now are choking many of the streams of Louisiana and Mississippi. The antelopes were to be acclimatized as a food supply for the people at large. This measure well illustrates the prevailing disposition of the American people to-day,--to ignore and destroy their own valuable natural stock of wild birds and mammals, and when they have completed their war of extermination, reach out to foreign countries for foreign species. Instead of preserving the deer of the South, the South reaches out for the utterly impossible antelopes of Africa, and the preposterous hippopotamus. The North joyously exterminates her quail and ruffed grouse, and goes to Europe for the Hungarian partridge. That partridge is a failure here, and I am _heartily glad of it_, on the ground that the exterminators of our native species do not deserve success in their efforts to displace our finest native species with others from abroad. The hippo-antelope proposition is a climax of absurdity, in proposing the replacing of valuable native game with impossible foreign species. * * * * * CHAPTER XXV LAW AND SENTIMENT AS FACTORS IN PRESERVATION There is grave danger that through ignorance of the true character of about 80 per cent of the men and boys who shoot wild creatures, a great wrong will be done the latter. Let us not make a fatal mistake. After more than thirty years of observation among all kinds of sportsmen, hunters and gunners, I am convinced that it is utterly futile and deadly dangerous to rely on humane, high-class sentiment to diminish the slaughter of wild things by game-hogs and pot-hunters. In some respects, the term ""game-hog"" is a rude, rough word; but it is needed in the English language, and it has come to stay. It is a disagreeable term, but it was brought into use to apply to a class of very disagreeable persons. A ""game-hog"" is a hunter of game who knows no such thing as sentiment or conscience in the killing of game, so long as he keeps within the limit of the law. Regardless of the scarcity of game, or of its hard struggle for existence, he will kill right up to the bag limit every day that he goes out, provided it is possible to do so. He uses the ""law"" as a salve for the spot where his conscience should be. He will shoot with any machine gun, or gun of big calibre, in every way that the law allows, and he knows no such thing as giving the game a square deal. He brags of his big bags of game, and he loves to be photographed with a wagon-load of dead birds as a background. He believes in automatic and pump guns, spring shooting, longer open seasons and ""more game."" He is quite content to shoot half tame ducks in a club preserve as they fly between coop and pond, whenever he secures an opportunity. He will gladly sell his game whenever he can do so without being found out, and sometimes when he is. Often a true sportsman drifts without realizing it into some one way of the confirmed game-hog; but the moment he is made to realize his position, he changes his course and his standing. The game-hog is impervious to argument. You can shame a horse away from his oats more easily than you can shame him from doing ""what the Law allows."" There are hundreds of thousands of gentlemen and gentlewomen who never once have come in touch with real cloven-footed game-hogs, who do not understand the species at all, and do not recognize its ear-marks. Thousands of such persons will tell you: ""In my opinion, the best way to save the wild life is to _educate the people_!"" I have heard that, many, many times. For right-hearted people, a little law is quite sufficient; and the best people need none at all! But the game-hogs are different. For them, the strict letter of the law, backed up by a strong-arm squad, is the only controlling influence that they recognize. To them it is necessary to say: ""You shall!"" and ""You shall not!"" Only yesterday the latest game-hog case was related to me by a game-protector from Kansas. Into a certain county of southern Kansas, from which the prairie-chicken had been totally gone for a dozen years or more, a pair of those birds entered, settled down and nested. Their coming was to many habitants a joyous event. ""Now,"" said the People, ""we will care for these birds, and they will multiply, and presently the county will be restocked."" But Ahab came! Two men from another county, calling themselves sportsmen but not entitled to that name, heard of those birds, and resolved to ""get them."" They waited until the young were just leaving the nest: and they went down and camped near by. On the first day they killed the two parent birds and half the flock of young birds, and the next day they got all the rest. But there is a sequel to this story. One of those men was a dealer in guns and ammunition; and when his customers heard what he had done, ""they simply put him out of business, by refusing to trade with him any more."" He is now washing dirty dishes in a restaurant; but at heart he is a game-hog, just the same. Near Bridgeport, Connecticut, a gentleman of my acquaintance owns a fine estate which is adorned with a trout stream and a superfine trout pond. Once he invited a business man of Bridgeport to be his guest, and fish for trout in his pond. On that guest, during a visit of three days all the finest forms of hospitality were bestowed. Two weeks later, my friend's game-warden caught that guest, early on a Sunday morning, _poaching_ on the trout-pond, and spoiled his carefully arranged get-away. In his book ""Saddle and Camp in the Rockies,"" Mr. Dillon Wallace tells a story of a man from New York who in the mountains of Colorado deliberately corrupted his guides with money or other influences, shot mountain sheep _in midsummer_, and ""got away with it."" In northern Minnesota, George E. Wood has been having a hand-to-hand fight with the worst community of game-hogs and alien-born poachers of which I have heard. There appears to be no game law that they do not systematically violate. The killers seem determined to annihilate the last head of game, in spite of fines and imprisonments. The foreigners are absolutely uncontrollable. The latest feature of the war is the discovery of a tannery in the woods, where the hides of illegally-slaughtered deer and moose are dressed. Apparently the only kind of a law that will save the game of northern Minnesota is one that will totally disarm the entire population. In Pennsylvania, there exists an association which was formed for the express purpose of fighting the State Game Commission, preventing the enactment of a hunter's license law and repealing the law against the killing of female deer and hornless fawns. The continued existence of that organization on that basis would be a standing disgrace to the fair name of Pennsylvania. I think, however, that that organization was founded on secret selfish purposes, and that ere long the general body of members will awaken to a realizing sense of their position, and range themselves in support of the excellent policies of the commission. A POT-HUNTER is a man or boy who kills game as a business, for the money that can be derived from its sale, or other use. Such men have the same feelings as butchers. From their point of view, they can see no reason why all the game in the world should not be killed and marketed. Like the feather-dealers, they wish to get out of the wild life all the money there is in it; that is all. Left to themselves, with open markets they would soon exterminate the land fauna of the habitable portions of the globe. No one can ""educate"" such people. For the gunners, game-hogs and pot-hunters, there is no check, save specific laws that sternly and amply safeguard the rights of the wild creatures that can not make laws for themselves. Nor can anyone educate the heartless woman of fashion who is determined to wear aigrettes as long as her money can buy them. The best women of the world have _already been educated_ on the bird-millinery subject, and they are already against the use of the gaudy badges of slaughter and extermination. But in the great cities of the world there are thousands of women who are at heart as cruel as Salome herself, and whose vicious tastes can be curbed only by the strong hand of the law. ""Sentiment"" for wild birds is not in them. Because of the vicious and heartless elements among men and women, we say, Give us _far-reaching, iron-bound_ LAWS for the protection of wild life, _and plenty of courageous men to enforce them_. * * * * * CHAPTER XXVI THE ARMY OF THE DEFENSE It now seems that the friends of wild life who themselves are not on the firing-line should be afforded some definite information regarding the Army of the Defense, and its strength and weakness. It is an interesting subject, but the limitations of space will not permit an extended treatment. Over the world at large, I think the active Destroyers outnumber the active Defenders of wild life at least in the ratio of 500 to 1; and the money available to the Destroyers is to the funds of the Defenders as 500 is to 1. The _average_ big-game sportsman cheerfully expends from $500 to $1,000 on a hunting trip, but resents the suggestion that he should subscribe from $50 to $100 for wild life preservation. If he puts down $10, he thinks he has done a Big Thing. Worse than this, I am forced to believe that at least 75 per cent of the big-game sportsmen of the world never have contributed one dollar in money, or one hour of effort, to that cause. But there are exceptions; and I can name at least fifty sportsmen who have subscribed $100 each to campaign funds, and some who have given as high as $1,000. Once I sat down beside a financially rich slaughterer of game, and asked him to subscribe a sum of real money in behalf of a very important campaign. I needed funds very much; and I explained, exhorted and besought. I pointed out his duty--_to give back something_ in return for all the game slaughter that he had _enjoyed_. For ten long minutes he stood fire without flinching, and without once opening his lips to speak. He made no answer no argument, no defense and finally he never gave up one cent. Wherever the English language is spoken, from Tasmania to Scotland, and from Porto Rico to the Philippines, the spirit of wild life protection exists. Elsewhere there is much more to be said on this point. To all cosmopolitan sportsmen, the British ""Blue Book"" on game protection, the annual reports of the two great protective societies of London, and the annual ""Progress"" report of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are reassuring and comforting. It is good to know that Uganda maintains a Department of Game Protection (A.L. Butler, Superintendent), that so good a man as Maj. J. Stevenson-Hamilton is in control of protection in the Transvaal, and that even the native State of Kashmir officially recognizes the need to protect the Remnant. There are of course many parts of the world in which game laws and limits to slaughter are quite unknown: all of which is entirely wrong, and in need of quick correction. No state or nation can be accounted wholly civilized that fails to recognize the necessity to protect wild life. I am tempted to make a list of the states and nations that were at latest advices destitute of game laws and game protectors, but I fear to do injustice through lack of the latest information. However, the time has come to search out delinquents, and hold up to each one a mirror that will reflect its shortcomings. Naturally, we are most interested in our own contingent of the Army of the Defense. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.--To-day the feeling in Congress, toward the conservation of wild life and forests is admirable. Both houses are fully awake to the necessity of saving while there is yet something to be saved. The people of the United States may be assured that the national government is active and sympathetic in the prosecution of such conservation measures as it might justly be expected to promote. For example, during the past five years we have seen Congress take favorable action on the following important causes, nearly every one of which cost money: The saving of the American bison, in four National ranges. The creation of fifty-eight bird refuges. The creation of five great game preserves. The saving of the elk in Jackson Hole. The protection of the fur seal. The protection of the wild life of Alaska. There are many active friends of wild life who confidently expect to see this fine list gloriously rounded out by the passage in 1913 of an ideal bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds. To name the friends of wild life in Congress would require the printing of a list of at least two hundred names, and a history of the rise and progress of wild life conservation by the national government would fill a volume. Such a volume would be highly desirable. When the story of the national government's part in wild-life protection is finally written, it will be found that while he was president, THEODORE ROOSEVELT made a record in that field that is indeed enough to make a reign illustrious. He aided every wild-life cause that lay within the bounds of possibility, and he gave the vanishing birds and mammals the benefit of every doubt. He helped to establish three national bison herds, four national game preserves, fifty-three federal bird refuges, and to enact the Alaska game laws of 1902 and 1907. It was in 1904 that the national government elected to accept its share of the white man's burden and enter actively into the practical business of wild life protection. This special work, originally undertaken and down to the present vigorously carried on by Dr. Theodore S. Palmer, has considerably changed the working policy of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, and greatly influenced game protection throughout the states. The game protection work of that bureau is alone worth to the people of this country at least twenty times more per annum than the entire annual cost of the Bureau. Next to the splendid services of Dr. Palmer, all over the United States, one great value of the Bureau is found in the fact-and-figure ammunition that it prepares and distributes for general use in assaults on the citadels of Ignorance and Greed. The publications of the Bureau are of great practical value to the people of the United States. [Illustration: NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (1) MADISON GRANT Secretary and Chairman Executive Committee, New York Zoological Society HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN President, New York Zoological Society JOHN F. LACEY Ex-Member of Congress; Author of the ""Lacey Bird Law"" WILLIAM DUTCHER Founder and President, National Association of Audubon Societies] Dr. Palmer is a man of incalculable value to the cause of protection. No call for advice is too small to receive his immediate attention, no fight is too hot and no danger-point too remote to keep him from the fray. Wherever the Army of Destruction is making a particularly dangerous fight to repeal good laws and turn back the wheels of progress, there will he be found. As the warfare grows more intense, Congress may find it necessary to enlarge the fighting force of the Biological Survey. The work that has been done by the Bureau in determining the economic value or lack of value of our most important species of insectivorous birds, has been worth millions to the agricultural interests of the United States. Through it we know where we stand. The reasons why we need to strive for protection can be expressed in figures and percentages; and it seems to me that they leave the American people no option but to _protect_! STATE GAME COMMISSIONS.--Each of our states, and each province of Canada, maintains either a State Game Commission of several persons, one Commissioner, or a State Game Warden. All such officers are officially charged with the duty of looking after the general welfare of the game and other wild life of their respective states. Theoretically one of the chief duties of a State Game Commission is to initiate new legislative bills that are necessary, and advocate their translation into law. The official standing of most game commissioners is such that they can successfully do this. In 1909 Governor Hughes of New York went so far as to let it be known that he would sign no new game bill that did not meet the approval of State Game Commissioner James S. Whipple. As a general working principle, and quite aside from Mr. Whipple, that was wrong; because even a State game commissioner is not necessarily infallible, or always on the right side of every wild-life question. As a rule, state commissioners and state wardens are keenly alive to the needs of their states in new game protective legislation, and a large percentage of the best existing laws are due to their initiative. Often, however, their usefulness is limited by the trammels of public office, and there are times when such officers can not be too aggressive without the risk of arousing hostile influences, and handicapping their own departmental work. For this reason, it is often advisable that bills which propose great and drastic reforms, and which are likely to become storm-centers, should originate outside the Commissioner's office, and be pushed by men who are perfectly free to abide the fortunes of open warfare. It should be distinctly understood, however, that lobbying in behalf of wild-life measures is _an important part of the legitimate duty of every state game commissioner_, and is a most honorable calling. [Illustration: NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (II) EDWARD HOWE FORBUSH Massachusetts State Ornithologist T. GILBERT PEARSON Secretary, National Association of Audubon Societies JOHN B. BURNHAM President, American Game Protective and Propagation Association ERNEST NAPIER President, Fish and Game Commission of New Jersey] Of the many strong and aggressive state game commissions that I would like to mention in detail, space permits the naming of only a very few, by way of illustration. NEW YORK.--Thanks to the great conservation Governor of this state, John A. Dix, the year 1911 saw our forest, fish and game business established on an ideal business basis. Realizing the folly of requiring a single man to manage those three great interests, and render to each the attention that it deserves and requires, by a well-studied legislative act a State Conservation Commission was created, consisting of three commissioners, one for each of the three great natural departments. These are salaried officers, who devote their entire time to their work, and are properly equipped with assistants. The state force of game wardens now consists of 125 picked men, each on a salary of $900 per year, and through a rigid system of daily reports (inaugurated by John B. Burnham) the activities and results of each warden promptly become known in detail at headquarters. Fortunately, New York contains a very large number of true sportsmen, who are ever ready to come forward in support of every great measure for wild-life protection. The spirit of real protection runs throughout the state, and in time I predict that it will result in a great recovery of the native game of the commonwealth. That will be after we have stopped all shooting of upland game birds and shore birds for about eight years. Even the pinnated grouse could be successfully introduced over one-third of the state, if the people would have it so. It was our great body of conscientious sportsmen who made possible the Bayne-Blauvelt law, and the new codification of the game laws of the state. TENNESSEE.--Clearly, Honorable Mention belongs to the unsalaried State Commissioner of Tennessee, Col. J.H. Acklen, ""than whom,"" says Dr. Palmer, ""there is no more active and enthusiastic game protectionist in this country. Whatever has been accomplished in that state is due to his activity and public spirit. Col. Acklen, who is now president of the National Association of Game Commissioners, is a prominent lawyer, and enjoys the distinction of being the only commissioner in the country who not only serves without pay, but also defrays a large part of the expenses of game protection out of his own pocket."" Surely the Commonwealth of Tennessee will not long permit this unsupported condition of such a game commissioner to endure. That state has a wild fauna worth preserving for her sons and grandsons, and it is inconceivable that the funds vitally necessary to this public service can not be found. ALABAMA.--I cite the case of Alabama because, in view of its position in a group of states that until recently have cared little about game protection, it may be regarded as an unusual case. Commissioner John H. Wallace, Jr., has evolved order out of chaos,--and something approaching a reign of law out of the absence of law. To-day the State of Alabama stands as an example of what can be accomplished by and through one clear-headed, determined man who is right, and knows that he is right. NEW JERSEY.--Alabama reminds one of New Jersey, and of State Game Commissioner Ernest Napier. I have seen him on the firing-line, and I know that his strong devotion to the interests of the wild life of his state, his determination to protect it at all costs, and his resistless confidence in asking for what is right, have made him a power for good. The state legislature believes in him, and enacts the laws that he says are right and necessary. He serves without salary, and gives to the state time, labor and money. It is a pleasure to work with such a man. In 1912 Commissioner Napier won a pitched battle with the makers of automatic and pump guns, both shotguns and rifles, and debarred all those weapons from use _in hunting_ in New Jersey unless satisfactorily reduced to two shots. MASSACHUSETTS.--The state of Massachusetts is fortunate in the possession of a very fine corps of ornithologists, nature lovers, sportsmen and leading citizens who on all questions affecting wild life occupy high ground and are not afraid to maintain it. It would be a pleasure to write an entire chapter on this subject. The record of the Massachusetts Army of the Defense is both an example and an inspiration to the people of other states. Not only is the cause of protection championed by the State Game Commission but it also receives constant and powerful support from the State Board of Agriculture, which maintains on its staff Mr. E.H. Forbush as State Ornithologist. The bird-protection publications of the Board are of great economic value, and they are also an everlasting credit to the state. The very latest is a truly great wild-life-protection volume of 607 pages, by Mr. Forbush, entitled ""_Game Birds, Wild-Fowl and Shore Birds_."" It is a publication most damaging to the cause of the Army of Destruction, and I heartily wish a million copies might be printed and placed in the hands of lawmakers and protectors. The fight last winter and spring for a no-sale-of-game law was the Gettysburg for Massachusetts. The voice of the People was heard in no uncertain tones, and the Destroyers were routed all along the line. The leaders in that struggle on the protection side were E.H. Forbush, William P. Wharton, Dr. George W. Field, Edward N. Goding, Lyman E. Hurd, Ralph Holman, Rev. Wm. R. Lord and Salem D. Charles. With such leaders and such supporters, any wild-life cause can be won, anywhere! PENNSYLVANIA.--The case of Pennsylvania is rather peculiar. As yet there is no large and resistless organized body of real sportsmen to rally to the support of the State Game Commission in great causes, as is the case in New York. As a result, with a paltry fund of only $20,000 for annual maintenance, and much opposition from hunters and farmers, the situation is far from satisfactory. Fortunately Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of the Commission and chief executive officer, is a man of indomitable courage and determination. But for this state of mind he would ere this have given up the fight for the hunter's license law (of one dollar per year), which has been bitterly opposed by a very aggressive and noisy group of gunners who do not seem to know that they are grievously misled. Fortunately, Commissioner John M. Phillips, of Pittsburgh is the ardent supporter of Dr. Kalbfus and a vigorous fighter for justice to wild life. He devotes to the cause a great amount of time and effort, and in addition to serving without salary he pays all his campaign expenses out of his own pocket. His only recompense for all this is the sincere admiration of his friends, and the consciousness of having done his full duty toward the wild life and the people of his native state. THE STATE AUDUBON SOCIETIES.--It is impossible to estimate the full value of the influence and work of the State Audubon Societies of the United States. Thus far these societies exist in thirty-nine states. From the beginning, their efforts have tended especially toward the preservation of the non-game birds, and it is well that the song and other insectivorous birds have thus been specially championed. Unfortunately, however, if that policy is pursued exclusively, it leaves 154 very important species of game birds practically at the mercy of the Army of Destruction! It would seem that the time has come when all Audubon Societies should take up, as a part of their work, active co-operation in helping to save the game birds from extermination. * * * * * THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF NEW YORK CITY On January 1, 1895, the United States of America contained, so far as I am aware, not one organization of national scope which was devoting any large amount of its resources and activities to the protection of wild life. At that time the former activities of the A.O.U. Committee on Bird Protection had lapsed. To-day the city of New York contains six national organizations, and it is now a great center of nation-wide activities in behalf of preservation. Furthermore, these activities are steadily growing, and securing practical results. THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--In 1895 there was born into the world a scientific organization having for its second declared object ""the preservation of our native animals."" It was the first scientific society or corporation ever formed, so far as I am aware, having a specifically declared object of that kind. It owes its existence and its presence in the field of wild-life conservation to the initiative and persistence of Mr. Madison Grant and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn. For sixteen years these two officers have worked together virtually as one man. It is not strange to find a sportsman like Mr. Grant promoting the wild-life cause, but it is a fact well worthy of note that of all the zoologists of the world, Professor Osborn is the only one of real renown who has actively and vigorously engaged in this cause, and taken a place in the front rank of the Defenders. Mr. Grant's influence on the protection cause has been strong and far-reaching,--far more so than the majority of his own friends are aware. He has promoted important protectionist causes from Alaska to Louisiana and Newfoundland, and helped to win many important victories. THE BOONE AND CROCKETT CLUB.--This organization of big game sportsmen was founded in 1885, and is the oldest of its kind in the United States. Its members always have supported the cause of protection, by law and by the making of game preserves. In all this work Mr. George Bird Grinnell, for twenty-five years editor of _Forest and Stream_, has been an important factor. As stated elsewhere, the club's written and unwritten code of ethics in big-game hunting is very strict. In course of time a Committee on Game Protection was formed, and it actively entered that field.

PHILLIPS Member, Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners EDWARD A. McILHENNY Founder of Wild-Fowl Preserves in Louisiana CHARLES WILLIS WARD Founder of Wild-Fowl preserves in Louisiana] THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AUDUBON SOCIETIES.--This organization was founded by William Dutcher, in 1902, and in 1906 it was endowed to the extent of $322,000 by the bequest of Albert Wilcox. Subsequent endowments, together with the annual contributions of members and friends, now give the Association an annual income of $60,000. It maintains eight widely-separated field agents and lecturers and forty special game wardens of bird refuges. It maintains Secretary T. Gilbert Pearson and a number of other good men constantly on the firing-line; and these forces have achieved many valuable results. After years of stress and struggle, it now seems almost certain that this organization will save the two white egrets,--producers of ""the white badge of cruelty,""--to the bird fauna of the United States, as in a similar manner it has saved the gulls, terns and other sea birds of our lakes and coast line. This splendid organization is one of the monuments to William Dutcher. More than two years ago he was stricken with paralysis, and now sits in an invalid's chair at his home in Plainfield, New Jersey. His mind is clear and his interest in wild-life protection is keen, but he is unable to speak or to write. While he was active, he was one of the most resourceful and fearless champions of the cause of the vanishing birds. To him the farmers of America owe ten times more than they ever will know, and a thousand times more than they ever will repay, either to him or to his cause. THE CAMP-FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA.--Although founded in 1897, this organization did not, as an organization, actively enter the field of protection until 1909. Since that time its work has covered a wide field, and enlisted the activities of many of its members. In order to provide a permanent fund for its work, each year the club members pay special annual dues that are devoted solely to the wild-life cause. The Committee on Game Protective Legislation and Preserves is a strong, hard-working body, and it has rendered good service in the lines of activity named in its title. THE AMERICAN GAME PROTECTIVE AND PROPAGATION ASSOCIATION.--This is the youngest protective organization of national scope, having been organized in 1911. Its activities are directed by John B. Burnham, for five years Chief Game Protector of the State of New York, and a man thoroughly conversant with the business of protection. The organization is financed chiefly by means of a large annual fund contributed by several of the largest companies engaged in manufacturing firearms and ammunition, whose directors feel that the time has come when it is both wise and necessary to take practical measures to preserve the remnant of American game. Already the activities of this organization cover a wide range, and it has been particularly active in enlisting support for the Weeks bill for the federal protection of migratory birds. THE WILD LIFE PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION came into existence in 1910, rather suddenly, for the purpose of promoting the cause of the Bayne no-sale-of-game bill, and other measures. It raised the fund that met the chief expenses of that campaign. Since that time it has taken an important part in three other hotly contested campaigns in other states, two of which were successful. At the present moment, and throughout the future, these New York organizations need _large sums of money_ with which to meet the legitimate expenses of active campaigns for great measures. They need _some_ money from outside the state of New York! _Too much of the burden of national campaigning has been and is being left to be borne by the people of New York City_. This policy is growing monotonous. There is every reason why Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Boston should each year turn $100,000 into the hands of these well-equipped and well managed national organizations whose officers know _how to get results_, all over our country. Such organizations as these do not exist in other cities; and this is very unfortunate. New Orleans should be a center of protectionist activity for the South, San Francisco for the Pacific slope, and Chicago for the Middle West. Will they not become so? TWO INDEPENDENT WORKERS.--At the western edge of the delta of the Mississippi there have arisen two men who loom up into prominence at an outpost of the Army of Defense which they themselves have established. For what they already have done in the creation of wild-fowl preserves in Louisiana, Edward A. McIlhenny and Charles Willis Ward deserve the thanks of the American People-at-large. An account of their splendid activities, and the practical results already secured, will be found in Chapter XXXVIII, on ""Private Game Preserves,"" and in the story of Marsh Island. Already the home of these gentlemen, Avery Island, Louisiana, has become an important center of activity in wild-life protection. * * * * * CHAPTER XXVII HOW TO MAKE A NEW GAME LAW THE LINE OF ACTION.--In the face of a calamity, the saving of life and property and the check of fire and flood depends upon good judgment and quick action at the critical moment. In emergencies, the slow and academic method will not serve. It is the run, the jump, the short cut and the violent method that saves life. If a woman is drowning, the sensible man does not wait for an introduction to her; nor does he run to an acquaintance to borrow his boat, or stop to put on a collar and necktie. He seizes the first boat that he can find, and breaks its lock and chain if necessary; or, failing that, he plunges in without one. When he reaches the imperiled party, he doesn't say, ""Will you kindly let me save you?"" He seizes her by the hair, and tries to keep her head above water, without ceremony. That is to-day the condition and the treatment necessary regarding our remnant of wild life. We are compelled to act quickly, directly, and even violently at times, if we save anything worth while. There is _no time_ to depend upon the academic ""education"" of the public by the seductive illustrated lecture on birds, or the article about the habits of mammals. Those methods are all well enough in their places, but we must not depend upon them in emergencies like the present, for they do not pass laws or arrest lawbreakers. Give the public all of that material that you can supply, and the more the better, but for heaven's sake _do not_ depend upon the spread of bird-lore ""education"" to stop the work of the game-hogs! If you do, all the wild life will be destroyed while the educational work is going on. Often you can educate a gunner, and make him a protectionist; but you never can do it by showing him pictures of birds. He needs strong reasoning and exhortation, not bird-lore. To-day it is necessary to employ the most direct, forceful and at times even rude methods. Where slaughtering cannot be stopped by moral suasion, it must be stopped with a hickory club. The thing to do is to _get results, and get them quickly, before it is too late_! If the business section of a town is burning down, no one goes into the suburbs to lecture on architecture, or exhibit pictures of fire apparatus. The rush is for water, fire-engines, red-blooded men and dynamite. When the birds all around you are being shot to death by poachers who fear not God nor regard man, and you need help to stop it on the instant, run to your neighbor's house, and ring his bell. If he fails to hear the bell, pound on his door until you jar the whole house. When he comes down half-dressed, blinking and rubbing his eyes, shout at him: ""Come out! Your birds are all being shot to pieces!"" ""Are they?"" he will say. ""But what can _I_ do about it? I can't help it! I'm no game warden."" ""Put on your clothes, get your shot-gun and come out and drive off the killing gang."" ""But what good will that do? They will come back again."" ""Not if we do our duty. We must have them arrested, and appear against them in court."" ""But,"" says the sleepy citizen, ""That won't do much good. The laws are not strict enough; and besides, they are not well enforced, even as they are!"" ""Then let's make it our business to see that the present laws are enforced, and go to our members of the legislature, and have them pass some stronger laws."" And this brings me to a very important subject: * * * * * HOW TO PASS A NEW LAW We venture to say that the average citizen little realizes how possible it is to secure the passage of a law that is clearly necessary for the better protection of wild life and forests. Because of this, and of the necessity for exact knowledge, I shall here set down specific instructions on this subject. THE PERSONAL EQUATION.--One determined man can secure the passage of a good law, provided he is reasonably intelligent and sufficiently determined. The man who starts a movement must make up his mind to follow it up, direct its fortunes, stay with it when the storms of opposition beat upon it, and never give up until it is signed by the governor. He must be willing to sacrifice his personal convenience, many of his pleasures, and work when his friends are asleep or pleasuring. In working for the protection of wild life there is one mighty and unfailing source of consolation. It is this: _Your cause always gains in strength, and the cause of the destroyers always loses strength!_ THE CHOICE OF A CAUSE.--Be broad-minded. Do not rush to the legislature with a demand for a law to permit the taking of bull-heads with June-bugs in the creeks of your township, or to give your county a specially early open season on quail in order that your boy may try his new gun before he goes back to college. _Don't propose any ""local"" legislation_; for in progressive states, local game legislation is coming strongly into disfavor,--just as it should! Legislate for your whole state, and nothing less. Do not bother your legislature with a trivial bill. Choose a cause that is worth while to grown men, and it shall be well with you. It takes no more time to pass a large bill than a small one; and big men prefer to be identified with big measures. Before you have a bill drawn, advise with men whose opinions are worth having. If the end you have in mind is a great and good one, _go ahead_, whether you secure support in advance or not. If the needs of the hour clearly demand the measure, _go ahead_, even though you start absolutely alone. A good measure never goes far without attracting company. DRAFTING A BILL.--As a rule, the members of a legislative body do not have time to draft bills on subjects that are new or strange to them. A short bill is easily prepared by your own representative; but a lengthy bill, covering a serious reform, is a different matter. Hire a lawyer to draft the bill for you. A really good lawyer will not charge much for drafting a bill that is to benefit the public, and grind no private axe; but if the bill is long, and requires long study, even the good citizen must charge something. Your bill must fully recognize existing laws. It must be either prohibitory or permissive; which means that it can say what shall not be done, or else that which may be done according to law, all other acts being forbidden. Your lawyer must decide which form is best. For my part, I greatly prefer the prohibitive form, as being the stronger and more impressive of the two. I think it is the province of the law _to forbid_ the destruction of wild life and forests, under penalties. PENALTIES.--Every law should provide a penalty for its infringement; but the penalty should not be out of all proportion to the offense. It is just as unwise to impose a fine of one dollar for killing song-birds for food as it is to provide for a fine of three hundred dollars. A fine that is too small fails to impress the prisoner, and it begets contempt for the law and the courts! A fine that is altogether too high is apt to be set aside by the court as ""excessive."" In my opinion, the best fines for wild life slaughter would be as follows: Shooting, netting or trapping song-birds, and other non-game birds, each bird $5 to $25 Killing game birds out of season, each bird 10 to 50 Selling game contrary to law, each offense 100 to 200 Dynamiting fish 100 to 200 Seining or netting game fishes 50 to 200 Shooting birds with unfair weapons 10 to 100 Killing an egret, Carolina parakeet or whooping crane 100 to 200 Killing a mountain sheep or antelope anywhere in the U.S. 500 Killing an elk contrary to law 50 Killing a female deer, or fawn without horns, each offense 50 Trapping a grizzly bear for its skin 100 For killing a man ""by mistake,"" the fine should be $500, payable in five annual instalments, to the court, for the family of the victim. Whenever fines are not paid, the convicted party should be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor at the rate of one-half day for each dollar of the fine imposed; and a sentence at hard labor should be the _first option of the court_! Many a rich and reckless poacher snaps his fingers at fines; but a sentence to hard labor would strike terror to the heart of the most brazen of them. To all such men, ""labor"" is the twin terror to ""death."" THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL.--Much wisdom is called for in the selection of legislative champions for wild-life bills. It is possible to state here only the leading principles involved. Of course it is best to look for an introducer within the political party that is in the majority. A man who has many important bills on his hands is bound to give his best attention to his own pet measures; and it is best to choose a man who is not already overloaded. If a man has a host of enemies, pass him by. By all means choose a man whose high character and good name will be a tower of strength to your cause; and if necessary, _wait for him to make up his mind_. Mr. Lawrence W. Trowbridge waited three long and anxious weeks in the hope that Hon. George A. Blauvelt would finally consent to champion the Bayne bill in the New York Assembly. At last Mr. Blauvelt consented to take it up; and the time spent in waiting for his decision was a grand investment! He was the Man of all men to pilot that bill through the Assembly. Very often the ""quiet man"" of a legislative body is a good man to champion a new and drastic measure. The quiet man who makes up his mind to take hold of ""a hard bill to pass"" often astonishes the natives by his ability to get results. Representative John F. Lacey, of Iowa, made his name a household word all over the United States by the quiet, steady, tireless and finally resistless energy with which for three long years in Congress he worked for ""the Lacey bird bill."" For years his colleagues laughed at him, and cheerfully voted down his bill. But he persisted. His cause steadily gained in strength; and his final triumph laid the axe at the root of a thousand crimes against wild life, throughout the length and breadth of this land. He rendered the people of America a service that entitles him to our everlasting gratitude and remembrance. AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL.--As soon as a bill is introduced it is referred to a committee, to be examined and reported upon. If there is opposition,--and to every bill that really does something worth while there always is opposition,--then there is a ""hearing."" The committee appoints a day, when the friends and foes of the bill assemble, and express their views. The week preceding a hearing is your busy week. You must plan your campaign, down to the smallest details. Pick the men whom you wish to have speak (for ten minutes each) on the various parts of your bill, and divide the topics and the time between them. Call upon the friends of the bill in various portions of the state to attend and ""say something."" Go up with a strong body of fine men. _Have as many organizations represented as you possibly can_! The ""organizations"" represent the great mass of people, and the voters also. When you reach the hearing, hand to your bill's champion, who will be floor manager for your side, a clear and concise list of your speakers, carefully arranged and stating who's who. That being done, you have only to fill your own ten minutes and afterward enjoy the occasion. THE VALUE OF ACCURACY.--It is unnecessary to say, in working for a bill,--_always be sure of your facts_. Never let your opponents catch you tripping in accuracy of statement. If you make one serious error, your enemies will turn it against you to the utmost. Better understate facts than overstate them. This shrewd old world quickly recognizes the careful, conservative man whose testimony is so true and so rock-founded that no assaults can shake it. Legislators are quick to rely on the words and opinions of the man who can safely be trusted. If your enemies try to overwhelm you with extravagant statements, that are unfair to your cause, the chances are that the men who judge between you will recognize them by their ear-marks, and discount them accordingly. WORK WITH MEMBERS.--Sometimes a subject that is put before a legislative body is so new, and the thing proposed is so drastic, it becomes necessary to take measures to place a great many facts before each member of the body. Under such circumstances the member naturally desires to be ""shown."" The cleanest and finest campaigning for a reform measure is that in which both sides deal with facts, rather than with personal importunities. With a good cause in hand, it is a pleasure to prepare concise statements of facts and conditions from which a legislator may draw logical conclusions. Whenever a bill can be won through in that way, game protection work becomes a delight. In all important new measures affecting the rights and the property of the whole people of a state, the conscientious legislator wishes to know how the people feel about it. When you tell him that ""The wild life belongs to the whole people of the state; and this bill is in their interest,"" he needs to know for certain that your proposition is true. Sometimes there is only one way in which he can be fully convinced; and that is by the people of his district. Then it becomes necessary to send out a general alarm, and call upon the People to write to their representatives and express _their_ views. Give them, in printed matter, the _latest facts_ in the case, forecast the future as you think it should be forecast, then demand that the men and women who are interested do write to their senators and assemblyman, and express _their_ views, in _their own way!_ Let there be no ""machine letters"" sent out, all ready for signature; for such letters are a waste of effort, and belong in the waste baskets to which they are quickly consigned. The members of legislative bodies hate them, and rightly, too. They want to hear from men who can think for themselves, give reasons of their own, and express their desires in their own way. THE PRESS AND THE NEWSPAPERS.--It is impossible to overestimate the influence of the newspapers and the periodical press in general, in the protection of wild life. But for their sympathy, their support and their independent assaults upon the Army of Destruction, our game species would nearly all of them have been annihilated, long ago. Editors are sympathetic and responsive good-citizens, as keenly sensitive regarding their duties as any of the rest of us are, and from the earliest times of protection they have been on the firing line, helping to beat back the destroyers. It is indeed a rare sight to see an editor giving aid, comfort or advice to the enemy. I can not recall more than a score of articles that I have seen or heard of during thirty years in this field that opposed the cause of wild life protection.[K] At this moment, for instance, I bear in particularly grateful remembrance the active campaign work of the following newspapers: [Footnote K: Just one hour after the above paragraph was written, a long telegram from San Francisco advised me that the _Examiner_ of that city had begun an active and aggressive campaign for the sale of all kinds of game.] The New York Times The New York Tribune The New York Herald The New York Globe The New York Mail and Express The New York World The New York Sun The Springfield (Mass.) Republican The Chicago Inter-Ocean The San Francisco Call The Rochester Union and Advertiser The Victoria Colonist The Brooklyn Standard-Union The New York Evening Post The New York Press The Buffalo News The Minneapolis Journal The Pittsburgh Index-Appeal The St. Louis Globe-Democrat The Philadelphia North American The Utica Observer The Washington Star. These magazines have done good service in the cause; and some of them have spent many years on the firing line: Forest and Stream The American Field Field and Stream Recreation (old and new) Rod and Gun in Canada In the Open Sports Afield Western Field Outdoor Life Shield's Magazine Sportsman's Review Outing Collier's Weekly The Independent Country Life Outdoor World Bird Lore In campaigning, always appeal for the help of the newspapers. If there are no private axes to grind, they help generously. The weekly journals are of value, but the monthlies are printed so long in advance of their dates of issue that they seldom move fast enough to keep abreast of the procession. Their mechanical limitations are many and serious. Every newspaper likes ""exclusive"" news, letters and articles. On that basis they will print about all the live matter that you can furnish. But at the same time, the important news of the campaign _must_ be sent to the press broadcast, in the form of printed slips all ready for the foreman. Many of these are never used, but the others are; and it pays. The news in every slip must be vouched for by the sender, or it will not be used. Often it will appear as a letter signed by the sender; which is all right, only the news is most effective when printed without a signature. Do not count on the Associated Press; because its peculiar demands render it almost impossible for it to be utilized in game protection work. HOW TO MEET OPPOSITION.--There is no rule for the handling of opposition that is fair and open. For opposition that is unfair and under-handed, there is one powerful weapon,--Publicity. The American people love fair play, and there is nothing so fatal to an unfair fighter as a searchlight, turned full on him without fear and without mercy. If it is reliably and persistently reported that some citizen who ought to be on the right side has for some dark reason become active on the wrong side, print the reports in a large newspaper, and ask him publicly if they are true. If the reports are false, he can quickly come out in a letter and say so, and end the matter. If they are true, the public will soon know it, and act accordingly. ETERNAL VIGILANCE.--The progress of a bill must be watched by some competent person from day to day, and finally from hour to hour. I know one bill that was saved from defeat only because its promoter dragged it, almost by force, out of the hands of a tardy clerk, and accompanied it in person to the senate, where it was passed in the last hour of a session. A bill should not be left to a long slumber in the drawer of a committee. Such delays nearly always are dangerous. SIGNING THE BILL.--The promoter of a great measure always seeks the sympathy of the Chief Executive early in the day; but he should not make the diplomatic error of trying to exact promises or pledges in advance. Good judges do not give away their decisions in advance. Because a Chief Executive remarks after a bill has been sent to him for signing that he ""cannot approve it,"" it is no reason to give up in despair. Many an executive approval has been snatched at the last moment, as a brand from the burning. _Ask for a hearing before the bill is acted upon_. At the hearing, and before it and after, the People who wish the bill to become a law must express themselves,--by letter, by telegram, and by appeal in person. If the governor becomes convinced that an _overwhelming majority_ of his people desire him to sign the bill, _he will sign it_, even though personally he is opposed to it! The hall mark of a good governor is a spirit of obedience to the will of the great majority. Not until your bill has been signed by the governor are you ready to go home with a quiet mind, take off your armor, and put your ear to the telephone while you hear some one say as your only reward,--""Well done, good and faithful servant."" AS TO ""CREDIT.""--Do not count upon receiving any credit for what you do in the cause of game protection, outside the narrow circle of your own family and your nearest friends. This is a busy world; and the human mind flits like a restless bird from one subject to another. The men who win campaigns are forgotten by the general public, in a few hours! There is nothing more fickle or more fleeting than the bubble called ""popular applause."" Judging by the experiences of great men, I should say that it has no substance, whatever. The most valuable reward of the man who fights in a great cause, and helps to win victories, is the profound satisfaction that comes to every good citizen who bravely does his whole duty, and leaves the world better than he found it, without the slightest thought of gallery applause. * * * * * CHAPTER XXVIII NEW LAWS NEEDED: A ROLL-CALL OF THE STATES The principles of wild-life protection and encouragement are now so firmly established as to leave little room for argument regarding their value. When they are set forth before the people of any given state, the only question is of willingness to do the right thing; of duty or a defiance of duty; of good citizenship or the reign of selfishness. Men who do not wish to do their duty purposely befog great issues by noisy talk and tiresome academic discussions of trivial details; and such men are the curse and scourge of reform movements. There are a very few persons who foolishly assert that ""there are too many game laws!"" It is entirely wrong for any person to make such a statement, for it tends to promote harmful error. The fact that our laws are _too lenient_, or are not fully enforced, is no excuse for denouncing their purposes. We have all along been too timid, too self indulgent, and too much afraid of hurting the feelings of the game-hogs. Give me the power to make the game laws of any state or province and I will guarantee to save the _non-migratory_ wild life of that region. I will not only make adequate laws, but I will also provide means, men and penalties by which _they will be enforced_! It is easy and simple, for men who are not afraid. I have been at considerable pains to analyze the game laws of each state, ascertain their shortcomings, and give a list of the faults that need correction by new legislation. It has required no profound wisdom to do this, because the principles involved are so plain that any intelligent schoolboy fifteen years old can master them in one hour. I have performed this task hopefully, in the belief that in many states the real issues have not been plainly put before the people. Hereafter no state shall destroy its wild life through ignorance of the laws that would preserve it. Let no man say that ""it is too late to save the wild life""; for excepting the dead-and-gone species, that is not true. Let no man say that ""we can not save the wild life by law""; for that is not true, either. As long as laws are lax, even law-abiding people will take advantage of them. There are millions of men who think it is _right to kill all the game that the law allows_! There are thousands of women who think it is right to wear aigrettes as long as the law permits their sale! And yet, if we are resolute and diligent there is plenty of hope for the future. During the past three years, to go no farther back, we have seen the whole state of New York swept clean of the traffic in native wild game by the Bayne law, and of the traffic in wild birds' plumage on women's hats through the Dutcher law. To-day, in this state, we find ninety-nine women out of every one hundred wearing flowers, and laces, and plush and satin on their hats, instead of the heads, bodies and feathers of wild birds that were the regular thing until three years ago. The change has been a powerful commentary on the value of good laws for the protection of wild life. The Dutcher law has caused the plumage of wild birds _almost wholly to disappear from the State of New York_! We shall here point out the plain duty of each state; and then it will be up to them, individually, to decide whether they can stand the blood-test or not. A state or a nation can be ungentlemanly, unfair or mean, just the same as an individual. No state has a right to maintain shambles for the slaughter of migratory game or song birds that belong in part to sister states. _Every state holds its migratory bird life in trust, for the benefit of the people of the nation at large_. A state is just as responsible for its treatment of wild life as any individual; and it is time to open books of account. It is robbery, as well as murder, for any southern state to slaughter the robins of the northern states, where no robins may be killed. _No southern gentleman can permit such doings, after the crime has been pointed out to him_! In the North, the men who are caught shooting robins are instantly haled to court, and fined or imprisoned. If we of the North should kill for food the mockingbirds that visit us, the people of the South instantly would brand us as monsters of greed and meanness; and they would be perfectly justified in so doing. Let us at least be honest in ""agreeing upon a state of fact,"" as the lawyers say, whether we act sensibly and mercifully or not. Just so long as there remains in this land of ours a fauna of game birds, and the gunners of one-half the states are allowed to dictate the laws for the slaughter of it, just so long will our present protection remain utterly absurd and criminally inadequate. Look at these absurdities: New York, New Jersey and many other northern states rigidly prohibit the late winter and spring shooting of waterfowl and shore birds, and limit the bag; North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and other southern states not only slaughter wild fowl and shore birds all winter and spring, without limit, but several of them kill certain non-game birds besides! All the northern states protect the robin, for the good that it does; but in North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and some other southern states, thousands of robins are shot for food. Minnesota has stopped spring shooting; but her sister state on the south, Iowa, obstinately refuses to do so. THE UNITED STATES AT LARGE.--There are two great measures that should be carried into effect by the governing body of the United States. One is the enactment of a law providing federal protection for all migratory birds; and Canada and Mexico should be induced to join with the United States _in an international treaty to that effect_. The other necessary measure is the passage of a joint resolution of Congress _declaring every national forest and forest reserve also a game preserve and general sanctuary for wild life_, in which there shall be no hunting or killing of wild creatures of any kind save predatory animals. The tendency of the times,--and the universal slaughter of wild life on this continent,--point straight as an arrow flies in that direction. Soon or late, we have GOT to come to it! If Congress does not take the initiatory steps, _the People will_! Such a consummation is necessary; it is justified by common sense and the inexorable logic of the situation, and when done it will be right. The time was when the friends of wild life did not dare speak of this subject in Washington save in whispers. That was in the days when the Appalachian Park bill could not be passed, and when there were angry mutterings and even curses leveled against Gifford Pinchot and the Forestry Bureau because so many national forests were being set aside. That was in the days when a few western sheep-men thought that they owned the whole Rocky Mountains without having bought them. To-day, the American people have grown accustomed to the idea of having the resources of the public domain saved and conserved for the benefit of the millions rather than lavished upon a favored few. To-day it is perfectly safe to talk about making every national forest a first class wild-life sanctuary, and it is up to the People to request Congress to take that action, at once. The Weeks bill, the Anthony bill, and the McLean bill now before Congress to provide federal protection for migratory birds are practically identical. All three are good bills; and it matters not which one finally becomes a law. Whichever is put forward finally for passage should provide federal protection for _all_ migratory birds that ever enter the United States, Alaska, or Porto Rico. Why favor the duck and leave the robin to its fate, or vice versa? It will be just as easy to do this task by wholes as by halves. The time to hesitate, to feel timid, or to be afraid of the other fellow has gone by. To-day the millions of honest and serious-minded Americans are ready to back the most thorough and most drastic policy, because that has become the most necessary and the best policy. Furthermore, it is the only policy worthy of serious consideration. Some of our states have done rather well in wild-life protection,--considering the absurdity of our national policy as a whole; others have done indifferently, and some have been and still are very remiss. Here is where we intend to hew to the line, and without fear or favor set forth the standing of each state according to its merits or its lack of merits. In a life-or-death matter such as now confronts us regarding the wild life of our country, it is time to speak plainly. In the following call of the States, the glaring deficiencies in state game laws will be set forth in detail, in order that the sore spots may be exposed to the view of the doctors. Conditions will be represented _as they exist at the end of the summer of 1912_, and it is to be hoped that these faults soon may be corrected. * * * * * A ROLL-CALL OF THE STATES ALABAMA: It is a satisfaction to be able to open this list with the name of a state that is entitled to a medal of honor for game protection. In this particular field of progress and enlightenment, the state of Alabama is the pioneer state of the South. New York now occupies a similar position in the North; but New York is an older state, and stronger in her general love of nature. The attainment of advanced protection in any southern state is a very different matter from what it is in the North. Five years ago Alabama set her house in order. The slaughter of song and insectivorous birds has been so far stopped as any Southern state can stop it unaided by the federal government, and those birds are recognized and treated as the farmers' best friends. The absurd system of attempted protection through county laws has been abandoned. The sale of game has been stopped, and since that stoppage, quail have increased. The trapping and export of game have ceased, and wild turkeys and woodcock are now increasing. It is unlawful to kill or capture non-game birds. Bag limits have been imposed, but _the bag limit laws are all too liberal, and should be reduced_. A hunter's license law is in force, and the department of game and fish is self-supporting. Night hunting is prohibited, and female deer may not be killed. A comprehensive warden system has been provided. As yet, however, Alabama Permits the shooting of waterfowl to March 15, which is too late, by one and one-half months. The use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be suppressed. There should be a limit of two deer per year, and killing should be restricted to deer with horns not less than three inches long. The story of game protection in Alabama began in 1907. Prior to that time, the slaughter of wild life was very great. It is known that enormous numbers of quail were annually killed by negro farm hands, who hunted at least three days each week, regardless of work to be done. The slaughter of quail, wild ducks, woodcock, doves, robins and snipe was described as ""nauseating."" The change that has been wrought since 1907 is chiefly due to the efforts of one man. Alabama owes her standing to-day to the admirable qualities of John H. Wallace, Jr., her Game and Fish Commissioner, author of the State's policy in wild-life conservation. His broad-mindedness, his judgment and his success make him a living object lesson of the power of one determined man in the conservation of wild life. Commissioner Wallace is an ardent supporter of the Weeks and Anthony bills for federal protection, and as a lawyer of the South, he believes there is ""no constitutional inhibition against federal legislation for the protection of birds of passage."" ALASKA: The sale of game must be absolutely prohibited, forever. The slaughter of big game by Indians, miners and prospectors should now be limited, and strictly regulated by law, on rational lines. The slaughter of walrus for ivory and hides, both in the Alaskan and Russian waters of Bering Sea, should be totally prohibited for ten years. The game-warden service should be quadrupled in number of wardens, and in general effectiveness. The game-warden service should be supplied with two sea-going vessels, independent for patrol work. The bag limit on hoofed game is 50 per cent too large. To accomplish these ends, Congress should annually appropriate $50,000 for the protection of wild life in Alaska. The present amount, $15,000, is very inadequate, and the great wild-life interests at stake amply justify the larger amount. It is now time for Alaska to make substantial advances in the protection of her wild life. It is no longer right nor just for Indians, miners and prospectors to be permitted by law to kill all the big game they please, whenever they please. The indolent and often extortionate Indians of Alaska,--who now demand ""big money"" for every service they perform,--are not so valuable as citizens that they should be permitted to feed riotously upon _moose, and cow moose at that_, until that species is exterminated. Miners and prospectors are valuable citizens, but that is no reason why they should forever be allowed to live upon wild game, any more than that hungry prospectors in our Rocky Mountains should be allowed to kill cattle. Alaska and its resources do not belong to the very few people from ""the States"" who have gone there to make their fortunes and get out again as quickly as possible. The quicker the public mind north of Wrangel is disabused of that idea, the better. Its game belongs to the people of this nation of ninety-odd millions, and it is a safe prediction that the ninety millions will not continue to be willing that the miners, prospectors and Indians shall continue to live on moose meat and caribou tongues in order to save bacon and beef. Mr. Frank E. Kleinschmidt said to me that at Sand Point, Alaska, he saw eighty-two caribou tongues brought in by an Indian, and sold at fifty cents each, while (according to all accounts) most of the bodies of the slaughtered animals became a loss. Governor Clark has recommended in his annual report for 1911 that the protection now enjoyed by the giant brown bear _(Ursus middendorffi_) on Kadiak Island be removed, for the benefit of settlers _and their stock_! It goes without saying that no one proposes that predatory wild animals shall be permitted to retard the development of any wild country that is required by civilized man. All we ask in this matter is that, as in the case of the once-proposed slaughter of sea-lions on the Pacific Coast, _the necessity of the proposed slaughter shall be fully and adequately proven before the killing begins_! It is fair to insist that the sea-lion episode shall not be repeated on Kadiak Island. The big game of Alaska can not long endure against a ""limit"" of two moose, three mountain sheep, three caribou and six deer per year, per man. At that rate the moose and sheep soon will disappear. The limit should be one moose, two sheep, two caribou and four deer,--unless we are willing to dedicate the Alaskan big game to Commercialism. No sportsman needs a larger bag than the revised schedule; and commercialists should not be allowed to kill big game anywhere, at any time. Let us bear in mind the fact that Alaska is being throughly ""opened up"" to the Man with a Gun. Here is the latest evidence, from the new circular of an outfitter: ""I will have plenty of good horses, and good, competent and courteous guides; also other camp attendants if desired. My intention is to establish permanently at that point, as I believe it is the gateway to the finest _and about the last_ of the great game countries of North America."" The road is open; the pack-train is ready; the guides are waiting. Go on and slay the Remnant! ARIZONA: The band-tailed pigeons and all non-game birds should immediately be given protection; and a salaried warden system should be established under a Commissioner whose term is not less than four years. The use of automatic and pump guns, in hunting, should be prohibited. Spring shooting should be prohibited. Arizona has good reason to be proud of her up-to-date position in the ranks of the best game-protecting states. No other state or territory of her age ever has made so good a showing of protective laws. The enactment of laws to cover the points mentioned above would leave little to be desired in Arizona. That state has a bird fauna well worth protecting, and game wardens are extremely necessary. ARKANSAS: The enforcement of game laws should be placed in charge of a salaried commissioner. Spring shooting of wildfowl should be stopped at once. A reasonable close season should be provided for water fowl, and swans should be protected throughout the year. A bag-limit law should be enacted. A force of game wardens, salaried and unsalaried, should at once be created. The killing of female deer and the hounding of deer, should be stopped. No buck deer should be shot, unless horns three inches long are seen before firing. A hunter's license law is necessary; and the fees should go to the support of the game protection department. The local exemptions in favor of market hunters in Mississippi county should be repealed. It appears that in Arkansas the laws for the protection and increase of wild life are by no means up to the mark. At this moment, Arkansas is next to Florida, the rearmost of all our states in wild-life protection. Awake, Arkansas! Consider the peril that threatens your fauna. The Sunk Lands, in your northeastern corner along the St. Francis River, are the greatest wild-fowl refuge anywhere in the Mississippi Valley between the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and the breeding-grounds of Minnesota. A duty to the nation devolves upon you, to protect the migratory waterfowl that visit your great bird refuge from the automatic and pump guns of the pothunters who shoot for northern markets, and kill all that they can kill. _Protect those Sunken Lands_! Confer a boon on all the people of the Mississippi Valley by making that region a bird refuge in fact as well as in name. Heretofore, you have permitted hired market gunners from outside your borders to slaughter the wild-fowl of your Sunk Lands literally by millions, and ship them to northern markets, with very little benefit to your people. It is time for that slaughter to cease. Don't maintain a duck and goose shambles in Mississippi County, year after year, as North Carolina does! Do unto other states as you would have other states do unto you. _Do not_ be afraid to pass nine good laws in one act. Clear your record in the Family of States, and save your fauna before it is too late. It is not fair for you to permit the slaughter of the insectivorous birds that are like the blood of life to the farmer and fruit grower. CALIFORNIA: The sale of all wild game should be forever prohibited. The use of automatic and pump shotguns, in hunting, should be prohibited. The killing of pigeons and doves as ""game"" and ""food"" should be stopped. The sage grouse and every other species of bird threatened with extinction should be given ten year close seasons. The mule deer (if any remain) and the Columbian black-tailed deer in the southern counties should be accorded a ten-year close season. A large state game preserve should be created immediately, on or near Mount Shasta and abundantly stocked with nucleus herds of antelope, black-tailed deer, bison and elk. A suitable preserve in the southern part of the state should be set aside for the dwarf elk. As game laws are generally regarded, California has on her books a series that look rather good to the eye, but which are capable of considerable improvement. All along the line, the birds and quadrupeds of the Golden State are vanishing! Under that heading, a vigorous chapter could be written; but space forbids its development here. Just fancy laws that permit gunning and hunting with dogs, from August until January--one-half the entire year! Think of the nesting birds that are disturbed or killed by dogs and gunners after other birds! California's wild ducks and geese have been slaughtered to an extent almost beyond belief. The splendid sage grouse and the sharp-tailed grouse are greatly reduced in numbers. Of her hundreds of thousands of antelope, once the cheapest game in the market, scarcely ""a trace"" remains. Her mountain sheep and mule deer are almost extinct. Her grizzly bears are gone! The most terrible slaughter ever recorded for automatic guns occurred in Glenn County, Cal., on Feb. 5, 1906, when two men (whose story was published in _Outdoor Life_, xvii, p. 371, April, 1906), killed 450 geese in one day, and actually bagged 218 of them in _one hour_! Every person who has paid attention to game protection on the Pacific coast well knows that during the past eight years or more, the work of game protection in California has been in a state of frequent turmoil. At times the lack of harmony between the State Fish and Game Commission and the sportsmen of the state has been damaging to the interests of wild life, and deplorable. In the case of Warden Welch, in Santa Cruz County, pernicious politics came near robbing the state of a splendid warden, but the courts finally overthrew the overthrowers of Mr. Welch, and reinstated him. The fish and game commissioners of any state should be broad-minded, non-partisan, strictly honest and sincere. So long as they possess these qualities, they deserve and should have the earnest and aggressive support of all sportsmen and all lovers of wild life. The remnant of wild life is entitled to a square deal, and harmony in the camp of its friends. Fortunately California has an excellent force of salaried game wardens (82 in all) and 577 volunteer wardens serving without salary. COLORADO: The State of Colorado should instantly stop the sale of native wild game to be used as food. It should stop all late winter and spring shooting of native wild birds. It should give the sage grouse, pinnated grouse and all shore birds a ten year close season, remove the dove from the list of game birds, and give it a permanent close season. It should remove the crane and the swan from the list of game birds. In twenty-five short years we have seen in Colorado a waste of wild life and the destruction of a living inheritance that has few parallels in history. Possibly the people of Colorado are satisfied with the residuum; but some outsiders regard all Rocky Mountain shambles with a feeling of horror. A brief quarter-century ago, Colorado was a zoological park of grand scenery and big game. The scenery remains, but of the great wild herds, only samples are left, and of some species not even that. The last bison of Colorado were exterminated in Lost Park by scoundrels calling themselves ""taxidermists,"" in 1897. Of the 200,000 mule deer that inhabited Routt County and other portions of Colorado, not enough now remain to make deer hunting interesting. A perpetual close season was put on mountain sheep just in time to save a dozen small flocks as seed stock. Those flocks have been permitted to live, and they have bred until now there are perhaps 3,500 sheep in the state. Of elk, only a remnant is left, now protected for fifteen years. The grizzly bear is so thoroughly gone that one is seen only by a rare accident; but black bears and pumas are sufficiently numerous to afford fair sport, provided the hunter has a fine outfit of dogs, horses and guides. Of prong-horned antelope, several bands remain, but it is reported that they are steadily diminishing. The herds and herders of domestic sheep are blamed for the decrease, and I have no doubt they deserve it. The sheep and their champions are the implacable enemies of all wild game, and before them the game vanishes, everywhere. The lawmakers of Colorado have tried hard to provide adequate statutes for the protection of the wild life of the state. In fact, I think that no state has put forth greater or more elaborate efforts in that direction. For example, in 1899, under the leadership of Judge D.C. Beaman of Denver, Colorado initiated the ""more game movement,"" by enacting a very elaborate law providing for the establishment of private game preserves and farms for the breeding of game under state license, and the tagging and sale of preserve-bred game under state supervision. [Illustration: BAND-TAILED PIGEON Often Mistaken for the Passenger Pigeon. The rapid Slaughter of this Species has Alarmed the Ornithologists of California, who now fear its Extinction] The history of game destruction in Colorado is a repetition of the old, old story,--plenty of laws, but a hundred times too many hunters, killing the game both according to law and contrary to it, and doing it five times as fast as the game could breed. That combination can safely be warranted to wipe out the wild life of any country in the world, and accomplish it right swiftly. As a big-game country, Colorado is distinctly out of the running. Her people are too lawless, and her frontiersmen are, in the main, far too selfish to look upon plenteous game without going after it. Some of these days, a new call of the wild will arise in Colorado, demanding an open season on mountain sheep. Those who demand it will say, ""What harm will it do to kill a few surplus bucks? It will improve the breed, and make the herds increase faster!"" By all means, have an ""open season"" on the Colorado big-horn and the British Columbia elk. It will ""do them good."" The excitement of ram slaughter will be good for the females, will it not? Of course, they will breed faster after that,--with all the big rams dead. Any ""surplus"" wild life is a public nuisance, and should promptly be shot to pieces. In Colorado there is some desire that Estes Park should be acquired as a national park, and maintained by the government; but the strong reasons for this have not yet appeared. As yet we have not heard any reason why the State of Colorado should not herself take it and make of it a state park and game preserve. If done, it could be offered as a partial atonement for her wastefulness in throwing away her inheritance of grand game. Colorado has work to do in the preservation of her remnant of bird life. In several respects she is behind the times. The present is no time to hesitate, or to ask the gunners what _they_ wish to have done about new laws for the saving of the remnant of game. The dictates of common sense are plain, and inexorable. Let the lawmakers do their whole duty by the remnant of wild life, whether the game killers like it or not. _The Curse of Domestic Sheep Upon Game and Cattle_.--Much has been said in print and out of print regarding the extent to which domestic sheep have destroyed the cattle ranges and incidentally many game ranges of the West; but the half hath not been told. The American people as a whole do not realize that the domestic sheep has driven the domestic steer from the free grass of the wild West, with the same speed and thoroughness with which the buffalo-hunters of the 70's and 80's swept away the bison. I have seen hundreds of thousands of acres of what once were beautiful and fertile cattle-grazing lands in Montana, that has been left by grazing sheep herds looking precisely as if the ground had been shaven with razors and then sandpapered. The sheep have driven out the cattle, and the price of beef has gone up accordingly. Neither cattle, horses nor wild game can find food on ground that has been grazed over by sheep. The following is the testimony of a reliable eye witness, Mr. Dillon Wallace, and the full text appears in his book, ""_Saddle and Camp in the Rockies_,"" (page 169):-- Domestic sheep and sheep herders are the greatest enemies of the antelope, as well as of other game animals and birds in the regions where herders take their flocks. The ranges over which domestic sheep pasture are denuded of forage and stripped of all growth, and antelope will not remain upon a range where sheep have been. Thus the sheep, sweeping clean all before them and leaving the ranges over which they pass unproductive, for several succeeding seasons, of pasturage for either wild or domestic animals, together with the destructive shepherds, are the worst enemies at present of Utah's wild game, particularly of antelope, sage hens, and grouse. In Iron county, which has already become an extensive sheep region, settlers tell us that before the advent of sheep, grass grew so luxuriously that a yearling calf lying in it could not be seen. Not only has the grass here been eaten, but the roots tramped out and killed by the hoofs of thousands upon thousands of sheep, and now wide areas, where not long since grass was so plentiful, are as bare and desolate as sand-piles. * * * * * CHAPTER XXIX NEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES (Continued) CONNECTICUT: The sale of all native wild game, regardless of its source, should be prohibited at all times. Enact at once a five-year close season law on the remnant of ruffed grouse, quail, woodcock, snipe, and all shore birds. Even in the home of the newest and deadliest ""autoloading"" shotgun, those guns and pump guns should be prohibited in hunting. The enormous bag limits of 35 rail and 50 each per day of plover, snipe and shore birds is a crime! They should be replaced by a ten-year close season law for all of those species. The terms of the game commissioners should be not less than four years. Like so many other states, Connecticut has recklessly wasted her wild-life inheritance. During the fifteen years preceding the year 1898, the bird life of that state had decreased 75 per cent. On March 6, 1912, Senator Geo. P. McLean, of Connecticut stated at the hearing held by his Committee on Forest Reservations and the Protection of Game this fact: ""We have more cover than there was thirty or forty years ago, more brush probably, but there is not one partridge [ruffed grouse] today where there were twenty ten years ago!"" First of all, Connecticut needs a ten-year close season law to save her remnant of shore birds before it is completely annihilated. Then she needs a Bayne law, and needs it badly. Under such a law, and the tagging system that it provides, the state game wardens would have so strong a grip on the situation that the present unlawful sale of game would be completely stopped. Half-way measures in preventing the sale of game will not answer. Already Connecticut has wasted thousands of dollars in fruitless efforts to restock her desolated woodlands and farms with quail, and to introduce the Hungarian partridge; but even yet she _will not_ protect her own native species! Men of Connecticut, save the last remnants of your native game birds before they are all utterly exterminated within your borders! Don't ask the killers of game what _they_ will agree to, but make the laws what _you know_ they should be! If you want a gameless state, let the destruction go on as it now is going, with _16,000 licensed gunners_ in the field each year, and you will surely have it, right soon. DELAWARE: Stop all spring shooting, at once; stop killing shore birds for ten years, and protect swans indefinitely. Enact bag-limit laws, in very small figures. Stop the sale of all native wild game, regardless of its use, by enacting a Bayne law. Enact a resident license law, and provide for a force of paid game wardens. Stop the use of machine shot-guns in killing your birds. The state of Delaware is nearly twenty years behind the times. Can it be possible that her Governor and her people are really satisfied with that position? We think not. I dare say they are afflicted with apathy, and game-hogs. The latter can easily back up General Apathy to an extent that spells ""no game laws."" In one act, and at one bold stroke, Delaware can step out of her position at the rear of the procession of states, and take a place in the front rank. Will she do it? We hope so, for her present status is unworthy of any right-minded, red-blooded state this side of the Philippines. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: The sale of all native wild game, regardless of its source, should be stopped immediately, by the enactment of a complete Bayne law. If game-shooting within the District is continued, on the marshes of the Eastern Branch and on the Potomac River, common decency demands the enactment of bag-limit laws and long close-season laws of the most modern pattern. Just why it is that gross abuses against wild life have so long been tolerated in the territorial center of the American nation, remains to be ascertained. But, whatever the reason the situation is absurd and intolerable, and Congress should terminate it immediately. As late as 1897, and I think for two or three years thereafter, thousands of _robins_ were sold every year in the public markets of Washington as food! As a spectacle for gods and men, behold to-day the sale of quail, ruffed grouse, wild turkeys and other American game, half way between the Capitol and the White House! Look at Center Market as a national ""fence"" for the sale of game stolen by market gunners from Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and Pennsylvania. It is time for Congress to bring the District of Columbia sharply into line; for Washington must be made to toe the mark beside New York. The reputation of the national capital demands it, whether the gods of the cafes will consent or not. FLORIDA: Shooting shore birds and waterfowl in late winter and spring should be stopped. The sale of all native wild game should be prohibited. A State Game Commissioner whose term of office should be not less than four years, and a force of salaried game wardens, should be appointed. A general resident license should be required for hunting. The killing of does and fawns should be stopped, and no deer should be killed save bucks with horns at least three inches long. The bag limit of five deer per year should be two deer; of twenty quail, and two turkeys per day should be ten quail and one turkey. The open season on all game birds should end on February 1, for domestic reasons. Protection should be accorded doves, and robins should be removed from the game list. In the destruction of wild life, I think the backwoods population of Florida is the most lawless and defiant that can be found anywhere in the United States. The ""plume-hunters"" have practically exterminated the plume-bearing egrets, wholly annihilated the roseate spoonbill, the flamingo, and also the Carolina parrakeet. On July 8, 1905, one of them killed an Audubon Association Warden, Guy M. Bradley, whose business it was to enforce the state laws protecting the egret rookeries. The people really to blame for the shooting of Guy Bradley, and the extermination of the egrets by lawless and dangerous men, are the vain and merciless women who wear the ""white badges of cruelty"" as long as they can be purchased! They have much to answer for! Originally, Florida was alive with bird life. For number of species, abundance of individuals, and general dispersal throughout the whole state, I think no other state in America except possibly California ever possessed a bird fauna quite comparable with it. Once its bird life was one of the wonders of America. But the gunners began early to shoot, and shoot, and shoot. During the fifteen years preceding 1898, the general bird life of Florida decreased in volume 77 per cent. In 1900 it was at a very low point, and it has steadily continued to decrease. The rapidly-growing settlement and cultivation of the state has of course had much to do with the disappearance of wild life generally, and the draining and exploitation of the Everglades will about finish the birds of southern Florida. The brown pelicans' breeding-place on Pelican Island, in Indian River, has been taken in hand by the national government as a bird refuge, and its marvelous spectacle of pelican life is now protected. Nine other islands on the coast of Florida have been taken as national bird refuges, and will render posterity good service. The great private game and bird preserve of Dr. Ray V. Pierce, at Apalachicola, known as St. Vincent Island, containing twenty square miles of wonderful woods and waters, is performing an important function for the state and the nation. The Florida bag limit on quail is entirely too liberal. I know one man who never once exceeded the limit of twenty birds per day, but in the season of 1908-9 he killed _865 quail_! Can the quail of any state long endure such drains as that? From a zoological point of view, Florida is in bad shape. A great many of her people who shoot are desperately lawless and uncontrollable, and the state is not financially able to support a force of wardens sufficiently strong to enforce the laws, even as they are. It looks as if the slaughter would go on until nothing of bird life remains. At present I can see no hope whatever for saving even a good remnant of the wild life of the state. The present status of wild-life protective laws in Florida was made the subject of an article in _Forest and Stream_ of August 10, 1912, by John H. Wallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of the State of Alabama, in an article entitled ""The Florida Situation."" In view of his record, no one will question either the value or the honest sincerity of Mr. Wallace's opinions. The following paragraphs are from that article: The enactment of a model and modern game law for the State of Florida is absolutely imperative in order to save many of the most valuable species of birds and game of that State from certain depletion and threatened extinction. The question of the protection of the birds and game in Florida is not a local one, but is national in its scope. Birds know no state lines, and while practically all the States lying to the north of Florida protect migratory birds and waterfowl, yet these are recklessly slaughtered in that state to such an extent as to be appalling to all sportsmen and bird lovers. So alarming has become the decrease of the birds and game of Florida that unless a halt is called on the campaign of reckless annihilation that has been ceaselessly waged in that state, the sport and recreation enjoyed by primeval nimrods will linger only in history and tradition. It is the sincerest hope of all lovers of wild life of the American continent that a strong and invincible sentiment, relative to the imperative necessity of real conservation legislation, be crystallized in the minds of the members elect of the Florida Legislature, to the end that the next Legislature will spread upon the statute books of the State of Florida a model and modern law for the preservation and protection of the birds and game of that State, which when put into practical operation will elicit the thanks of all good citizens, and likewise the gratitude of future generations. GEORGIA: Prohibit late winter and spring shooting, and provide rational seasons for wild fowl. Reduce the limit on deer to two bucks a season, with horns not less than three inches long. Protect the meadow lark and stop forever the killing of doves and wood-ducks. Prohibit the use of automatic and pump shot-guns in hunting. Extend the term of the game commissioner to four years. We are glad to report that Georgia has already begun to take up the white man's burden. The protection of wild life is now a gentleman's proposition, and in it every real man with red blood in his veins has a duty to perform. The state of Georgia has recently awakened, and under the comprehensive law of 1911 has resolutely undertaken to do her whole duty in this matter. IDAHO: The imperative duties of Idaho are as follows: Stop all hunting of mountain sheep, mountain goat and elk. Give the sage grouse and sharp-tail ten-year close seasons, at once, to forestall their extermination. Stop the killing of doves as ""game."" Stop the killing of female deer, and of bucks with horns less than three inches long. Enact the model law to protect non-game birds. Prohibit the use of machine shot-guns in hunting. Extend the State Warden's term to four years. Like Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, the state of Idaho has wasted her stock of game, and it is to be feared that several species are now about to disappear from that state. I am told that the sage grouse is almost ""gone""; and I think that the antelope, caribou, and mountain sheep are in the same condition of scarcity. If the people of Idaho wish to save their wild fauna, they must be up and doing. The time to temporize, theorize, be conservative and easy-going has gone by. It is that fatal policy that causes men to slumber until it is too late to act; and we will watch with keen interest to see whether the real men of Idaho are big enough to do their whole duty in time to benefit their state. In 1910, Dr. T.S. Palmer credited Idaho with the possession of about five hundred moose and two hundred antelope. There is one feature of the Idaho game law that may well stand unchanged. The open season on ""ibex,"" of which one per year may be killed, may as well be continued. One myth per year is not an extravagant bag for any intelligent hunter; and it seems that the ""ibex"" will not down. Being officially recognized by Idaho, its place in our fauna now seems assured. ILLINOIS: Enact a Bayne law, and stop the sale of all native wild game, regardless of source, and regardless of the gay revelers of Chicago. In Illinois the bag limits on birds are nearly all at least 50 per cent too high. They should be as follows: No squirrels, doves or shore birds; six quail, five woodcock, ten coots, ten rail, ten ducks, three geese and three brant, with a total limit of ten waterfowl per day. Doves should be removed from the game list. All tree squirrels and chipmunks should be perpetually protected, as companions to man, unfit for food. The sale of aigrettes should be stopped, and Chicago placed in the same class as Boston, New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. The use of all machine shotguns in hunting should be prohibited. The chief plague-spots for the grinding up of American game are Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco. St. Louis cleared her record in 1909. New York thoroughly cleaned her Augean stable in 1911, and Massachusetts won her Bayne law by a desperate battle in 1912. In 1913, Pennsylvania probably will enact a Bayne law. Fancy a city in the center of the United States sending to Norway for 1,500 ptarmigan, to eat, as Chicago did in 1911; and that was only one order. For forty years the marshes, prairies, farms and streams of the whole upper Mississippi Valley have been combed year after year by the guns of the market shooters. Often the migratory game was located by telegraphic reports. Game birds were slain by the wagon-load, boat-load, barrel, and car-load, ""for the Chicago market."" And the fool farmers of the Middle West stolidly plowed their fields and fed their hogs, and permitted the slaughter to go on. To-day the sons of those farmers go to the museums and zoological parks of the cities to see specimens of pinnated grouse, crane, woodcock, ducks and other species that the market shooters have ""wiped out""; and their fathers wax eloquent in telling of the flocks of pigeons that ""darkened the sky,"" and the big droves of prairie chickens that used to rise out of the corn-fields ""with a roar like a coming storm."" To-day, Chicago stands half-way reformed. Her markets are open to only one-half the game killable in Illinois, but they are wide open to all ""_legally_ killed game imported from other states, from Oct. 1 to Feb. 1."" Through that hole in her game laws any game-dealer can drive a moving-van! Of course, any game offered in Chicago has been ""legally killed in some other state!"" Who can prove otherwise? In addition to the imported game illegally killed in other states, the starving population of Chicago may also buy for cash, and consume with their champagne in November and December, all the Illinois doves that can be combed out by the market-gunners. After the awful Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago, in 1903, the game dealers reported a heavy falling off in the consumption of game! The tragedy caused the temporary closing of the theaters, and the falling off in after-theater suppers may be said to have taken away the appetites of thousands of erstwhile consumers of game. Incidentally it showed who consumes purchased game. The people of Illinois should now enact a full-fledged Bayne law, without changing a single word, and bring Chicago up to the level of New York, St. Louis and Boston. The present bag limits on Illinois game birds are fatally high. As they stand, with 190,000 licensed gunners in the field each year, what else do they mean than extermination? The men of Illinois have just two alternatives between which to choose: drastic and immediate preservation, or a gameless state. Which shall it be? INDIANA: Indiana should hasten to stop spring shooting. She should enact a law, prohibiting the sale for millinery purposes of the plumage of all wild birds save ducks killed in their open season. A Bayne law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of all native wild game, should be enacted at once. The killing of squirrels should be prohibited; because they are not white men's game. Ruffed grouse and quail should have five year close seasons. The use of pump and autoloading guns in hunting should be prohibited. In Indiana the white-tailed deer is extinct. This means very close hunting, and a bad outlook for all other game larger than the sparrow. On October 2, 1912, eleven heads of greater bird of paradise, with plumes attached, were offered for sale within one hundred feet of the headquarters of the Fourth National Conservation Congress. The prices ranged from $35 to $47.50; and while we looked, two ladies came up, one of whom pointed to a bird-of-paradise corpse and said: ""There! I want one o' them, an' I'm a-goin' to _have_ it, too!"" IOWA: Spring shooting should be stopped, at once and forever. The killing of all tree squirrels and chipmunks should cease. All shore birds that visit Iowa deserve a five-year close season. Especially is the shooting of plover, sandpiper, marsh and beach birds, rail, duck, geese and brant from September 1, to April 15, an outrage. Iowa should prohibit the use of the machine guns, and it is to be hoped that she will awaken sufficiently to do so. It is said that the Indian word ""Iowa"" means ""the drowsy, or sleepy ones."" Politically, and educationally, Iowa is all right, but in the protection of wild life she is ten years behind the times, in almost everything save the prohibition of the sale of game. _Iowa knows better than to pursue the course that she does_! She boasts about her corn and hogs, but she is deaf to the appeals of the states surrounding her on the subject of spring shooting. For years Minnesota has set her a good example; but nothing moves her to step up where she belongs in the phalanx of intelligent game-protecting states. The foregoing may sound harsh, but in view of what other states have endured from Iowa's stubbornness regarding migratory game, the time for silent treatment of her case has gone by. She is to-day in the same class as North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland,--at the tail end of the procession of states. She cares everything for corn and hogs, but little for wild life. KANSAS: Spring shooting should be stopped, at once: with apologies for not having done so long ago. The continued shooting of prairie chickens when the species is near extermination is outrageous, and should be prohibited for ten years. Doves should be removed permanently from the game list, partly as a measure of self respect. Kansas should treat herself to a force of salaried game wardens rendering real service. She should bar out the machine guns as unfit for use in a well-regulated State. Kansas has calmly witnessed the extermination of her bison, elk, deer, antelope, wild turkeys, sage grouse, whooping cranes, and the beginning of the end of her pinnated grouse, without a pang. What is wild game in comparison with fat hogs, and seventy-bushels-to-the-acre! Draw a line around the hog-and-corn area of the United States, and within it you will find more spring shooting, more sale of game and more extermination of species than in any other area in the United States. I refer to Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. In not one of these states except Missouri is there any big game hunting, and in the majority of them spring shooting is lawful! In the Island of Mauritius, it was swine that exterminated the dodo. In the United States, hogs and game extermination still go hand in hand. Since the days of the dodo, however, a new species of swine has been developed. It is now widely known as the ""game-hog,"" and it has been officially recognized by both bench and bar. KENTUCKY: Nearly everything that a state should maintain in the line of wild life protection _Kentucky lacks_! It is easier to tell what she has than to recite what she should have. Kentucky _permits spring shooting_; she has _no bag limits_, and she has _long open seasons_ on everything save introduced pheasants; She protects from sale only quail, grouse and wild turkey _killed within her own borders_. This means that her markets are practically wide open. Until recently the people of Kentucky have been very indifferent to the value of her wild-life; but with the new law enacted this year providing for a game commission and a game protection fund, surely every member of the Army of the Defense will wish God-speed to her efforts in game conservation, and stand ready to lend a helping hand whenever help can be utilized. Kentucky should at one grand coup _stop spring shooting and all sale of wild game, accord long close seasons to all species that are verging on extinction, protect doves, establish moderate bag limits and stop the use of machine guns_. If she takes up these measures at the rate of only one at each legislative session, by the time her laws are perfect _all her game will be gone_! LOUISIANA: On more counts than one, Louisiana is in the list of Great Delinquents; for behold the things that she needs to do: Protect deer for five years. Instantly take the robin, red-winged black-bird, dove, grosbeak, wood-duck and gull off the list of birds that may be killed as ""game."" Stop all late winter and spring shooting. Stop the sale of all native game, and the possession and transportation of game sold or intended for sale. In short, Enact a Bayne law. Re-establish a game warden system. In legally permitting the slaughter of the robin, red-winged blackbird, dove, grosbeak, wood-duck and gull the state of Louisiana is very culpable. For good reasons, forty states of the American Union strictly prohibit the killing of song and insectivorous birds. The duty of every state to protect those birds is not a debatable proposition. I put this question to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and other states where the robin is treated as a game bird: Is it fair of you to kill and eat robins when that species is carefully protected by forty other states of our country for grave economic reasons? What would you say of the people of the North if they slaughtered your mockingbird _to eat_! Remember this proportion: The Robin : The North :: The Mockingbird : The South. * * * * * CHAPTER XXX NEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES (Continued) MAINE: There are reasons for the belief that Maine is conserving her large game better than any other state or province in North America. One glance over her laws is sufficient to convince anyone that instead of studying the clamor of her shooting population, Maine has actually been studying the needs of her game, and providing for those needs. If all other states were doing equally well, the task of writing a book of admonition would have been unnecessary. The proof of Maine's alertness is to be found in the number of her extra short, or entirely closed, seasons on game. For example: Cow and calf moose are permanently protected. Only bull moose, with at least two 3-inch prongs on its horns, may be killed. Caribou have had a close season since 1899. On gray and black squirrels, doves and quail, there is no open season. The open season for deer varies from ten weeks to four weeks, and in parts of three counties there is no open season at all. Silencers are prohibited, and firearms in forests may be prohibited by the Governor during droughts. Nearly all wild-fowl shooting ends January 1, but in two places, on December 1. People who have not learned the facts habitually think of Maine as a vast killing-ground for deer; and it is well for it to be known that the hunting-grounds have been carefully designated, according to the abundance or scarcity of game. Maine has wisely chosen to regard her hunting-grounds and her deer as a valuable asset, and she manages them accordingly. To be a guide in that state is to be a good citizen, and a protector of game from illegal slaughter. No non-resident may hunt without a licensed guide. The licenses for the thousands of deer killed in Maine each year, and the expenses of the visiting sportsmen who hunt them, annually bring into the state and leave there a huge sum of money, variously estimated at from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000. One can only guess at the amount from the number of non-resident licenses issued; but certainly the total can not be less than $1,000,000. Although Mr. L.T. Carleton is no longer chairman of the Commission of Inland Fisheries and Game, the splendid services that he rendered the state of Maine during his thirteen years of service, especially in the creation of a good code of game laws, constitute an imperishable monument to his name and fame. There is very little that Maine needs in the line of new legislation, or better protection to her game. With the enactment of a resident license law and a five-year close season for woodcock, plover, snipe and sandpipers, I think her laws for the protection of wild life would be sufficiently perfect for all practical purposes. The Pine-Tree State is to be congratulated upon its wise and efficient handling of the wild-life situation. MARYLAND: How has it come to pass that Maryland _lacks_ more good wild-life laws than any other state in the Union except North Carolina? Of the really fundamental protective laws, embracing the list that to every self-respecting state seems indispensable, Maryland has almost none save certain bag-limit laws! Otherwise, the state is wide open! It is indeed high time that she should abandon her present attitude of hostility to wild life, and become a good neighbor. She should do what is _fair_ and _right_ about the protection of the migratory game and bird life that annually passes twice through her territory! At the last session of the Maryland legislature, the law preventing the use of power boats in wild-fowl shooting was repealed. That was a step ten years backward; and Maryland should be ashamed of it! The list of things that Maryland must do in order to clear her record is a long one. Here it is: Local regulations should be replaced by a uniform state law. The sale of all native wild game should be stopped. Spring and late winter shooting of game should be stopped. All non-game birds not already included under the statutes should be protected. The exportation of all game should be prohibited, unless accompanied by the man who shot it, bearing his license, and the law should be state-wide instead of depending upon a separate enactment for each county. There should be a hunter's license law for all who hunt. The use of machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped, at once. Stop the use of power boats in wild-fowl shooting. MASSACHUSETTS: In 1912 the state of Massachusetts moved up into the foremost rank of states, where for one year New York had stood alone. She passed a counterpart of the New York law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of all wild American game in Massachusetts, but providing for the sale of game that has been reared in preserves and tagged by state officers. This victory was achieved only after three months of hard fighting. The coalition of sportsmen, zoologists and friends of wild life in general proved irresistible, just as a similar union of forces accomplished the Bayne law in New York in 1911. The victory is highly instructive, as great victories usually are. It proves once more that whenever the American people can be aroused from their normal apathy regarding wild life, _any good conservation legislation can be enacted!_ The prime necessities to success are good measures, good management, a reasonable campaign fund, and tireless energy and persistence. Massachusetts is to be roundly congratulated on having so thoroughly cleaned up her sale-of-game situation. Incidentally, five bills for the repeal of the Massachusetts law against spring shooting were introduced, and each one went down to the defeat that it deserved. _The repeal of a spring-shooting law, anywhere, is a step backward ten years!_ Massachusetts needs a bag-limit law more in keeping with her small remnant of wild life; and that she will have ere long. Very soon, also, her sportsmen will raise the standard of ethics in shotgun shooting, by barring out the automatic and pump shotguns so much beloved by the market shooters. As matters stand at this date (1912) the Old Bay State needs the following new laws: Low bag limits on all game. Five-year close seasons on all shore birds, snipe and woodcock. Expulsion of the automatic and pump shotguns, in hunting. MICHIGAN: On the whole, the game laws of Michigan are in excellent shape, and leave little to be desired in the line of betterment except to be simplified. All the game protected by the laws of the state is debarred from sale; squirrels, pinnated grouse, doves and wild turkeys enjoy long close seasons; the bag limits on deer and game birds are reasonably low; spring shooting still is possible on nine species of ducks; and this should be stopped without delay. Only three or four suggestions are in order: All spring shooting should be prohibited. All shore birds should have a five-year close season. The use of the machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped. The laws should permit the sale, under tag, of all species of game that can successfully be reared in preserves on a commercial basis. Two or three state game preserves, for deer, each at least four miles square, should be established without delay. MINNESOTA: This state should at once enact a bag-limit law that will do some good, instead of the statutory farce now on the books. Make it fifteen birds per day of waterfowl, all species combined, and no grouse or quail. There should be five-year close seasons enacted for quail, grouse, plover, woodcock, snipe, and all other shore birds. A law should be enacted prohibiting the use of firearms by unnaturalized aliens, and a $20 license for all naturalized aliens. Provision should be made for a large state game refuge in southern Minnesota. The state should prohibit the use of machine guns in hunting. To-day, direct and reliable advices show that the game situation in Minnesota is far from encouraging. Several species are threatened with extinction at an early date. In northern Minnesota it is reported that much game is surreptitiously trapped and slaughtered. The bob white is reported as threatened with total extinction at an early date; but I think the prairie chicken will be the first bird species to go. Moose will soon be extinct everywhere in Minnesota except in the game preserves. Apparently there is now about one duck in Minnesota for every ten ducks that were there only ten years ago. Now, what is Minnesota going to do about all this? Is she willing through Apathy to become a gameless state? Her people need to arouse themselves _now_, and pass several _strong_ laws. Her bag limit of forty-five birds _per day_ of quail, grouse, woodcock and plover, and _fifty_ per day of the waterbirds, is a joke, and nothing more; but it is no laughing matter. It spells extermination. MISSISSIPPI: The legalized slaughter of robins, cedar birds, grosbeaks and doves should cease immediately, on the basis of economy of resources and a square deal to all the states lying northward of Mississippi. The shooting of all water-fowl should cease on January 1. A reasonable limit should be established on deer. A hunting license law should be passed at once, fixing the fee at $1 and devoting the revenue to the pay of a corps of non-political game wardens, selected on a basis of ability and fitness. The administration of the game laws should be placed in charge of a salaried game commissioner. It is seriously to the discredit of Mississippi that her laws actually classify robins, cedar-birds, grosbeaks and doves as ""game,"" and _make them killable as such from Sept. 1 to March 1!_ I should think that if no economic consideration carried weight in Mississippi, state pride alone would be sufficient to promote a correction of the evil. If we of the North were to slaughter mockingbirds for food, when they come North to visit us, the men of the South would call us greedy barbarians; and they would be quite right. MISSOURI: The Missouri bag limits that permit the killing or possession of fifty birds per day are absurd, and fatally liberal. The utmost should be twenty-five; and even that is too high. Doves should be taken off the list of game birds, and protected throughout the year; and so should all tree squirrels. Spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited without delay. A law against automatic and pump guns should be enacted at the next legislative session, as a public lesson on the raising of the standard of ethics in shooting. The state of Missouri is really strong in her position as a game-protecting state. She perpetually protects such vanishing species as the ruffed grouse, prairie chicken (pinnated grouse), woodcock, and all her shore birds save snipe and plover. She prohibits the sale of native game and the killing of female deer; but she wisely permits the sale of preserve-bred elk and deer under the tags of the State Game Commission. For nearly all the wild game that is accessible, her markets are tightly closed. We heartily congratulate Missouri on her advanced position on the sale of game, and we hope that the people of Iowa will even yet profit by her good example. MONTANA: Like Colorado and Wyoming, Montana is wasting a valuable heritage of wild game while she struggles to maintain the theory that she still is in the list of states that furnish big-game hunting. It is a fact that ten years ago most sportsmen began to regard Montana as a has-been for big game, and began to seek better hunting-grounds elsewhere. British Columbia, Alberta and Alaska have done much for the game of Montana by drawing sportsmen away from it. Mr. Henry Avare, the State Game Warden, is optimistic regarding even the big game, and believes that it is holding its own. This is partially true of white-tailed deer, or it was up to the time of great slaughter. It is said that in 1911, 11,000 deer were killed in Montana, all in the western part of the state, seventy per cent of which were white-tails. The deep snows and extreme cold of a long and unusually severe winter drove the hungry deer down out of the mountains into the settlements, where the ranchmen joyously slaughtered them. The destruction around Kalispell was described by Harry P. Stanford as ""sickening."" Mr. Avare estimates the prong-horned antelope in Montana at three thousand head, of which about six hundred are under the quasi-protection of four ranches. The antelope need three or four small ranges, such as the Snow Creek Antelope Range, where the bad lands are too rough for ranchmen, but quite right for antelopes and other big game. All the grouse and ptarmigan of Montana need a five-year close season. The splendid sage grouse is now extinct in many parts of its previous range. Fifty-eight thousand licensed gunners are too many for them! The few mountain sheep and mountain goats that survive should have a five-year close season, at once. The killing of female hoofed animals should be prohibited by law. Montana has not yet adopted the model law for the protection of non-game birds. Only seven states have failed in that respect. The use of automatic and pump shotguns, and silencers, should immediately be prohibited. Montana's bag-limits are not wholly bad; but the grizzly bear has almost been exterminated, save in the Yellowstone Park. Some of these days, if things go on as they are now going, the people of Montana will be rudely awakened to the fact that they have 50,000 licensed hunters but no longer any killable game! And then we will hear enthusiastic talk about ""restocking."" NEBRASKA: No other state has bestowed close seasons upon as many extinct species of game as Nebraska. Behold how she has resolutely locked the doors of her empty cage after all these species have flown: Elk, antelope, wild turkey, passenger pigeon, whooping crane, sage grouse, ptarmigan and curlew. In a short time the pinnated grouse can be added to the list of has-beens. There is little to say regarding the future of the game of Nebraska; for its ""future"" is now history. Provision should be made for one or more state game preserves. Spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited. A larger and more effective warden service should be provided. Doves should be removed from the game list. NEVADA: The sage grouse should be given a ten-year close season, for recuperation. All non-game birds should have perpetual protection. The cranes, now verging on extinction, and the pigeons and doves should at once be taken out of the list of game birds, and forever protected. All the shore birds need five years of close protection. A State Game Warden whose term of office is not less than four years should be provided for. A corps of salaried game protectors should be chosen for active and aggressive game protection. Nevada's bag limits are among the best of any state, the only serious flaw being ""10 sage grouse"" per day: which should be 0! Nevada still has a few antelope; and _we beg her to protect them all from being hunted or killed!_ It is my belief that if the antelope is really saved anywhere in the United States outside of national parks and preserves, it will be in the wild and remote regions of Nevada, where it is to be hoped that lumpy-jaw has not yet taken hold of the herds. NEW HAMPSHIRE: Speaking generally, the New Hampshire laws regulating the killing and shipment of game are defective for the reason that on birds, and in fact all game save deer, there appear to be no ""bag"" limits on the quantity that may be killed in a day or a season. The following bag limits are greatly needed, forthwith: Gray Squirrel, none per day, or per year; duck (except wood-duck), ten per day, or thirty per season; ruffed grouse, four per day, twelve per season; hare and rabbit, four per day, or twelve per season. Five-year close seasons should immediately be enacted for the following species: quail, woodcock, jacksnipe and all species of shore or ""beach"" birds. The sale of all native wild game should be prohibited; and game-breeding in preserves, and the sale of such game under state supervision, should be provided for. The use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be barred,--through state pride, if for no other reason. NEW JERSEY: New Jersey enjoys the distinction of being the second state to break the strangle-hold of the gun-makers of Hartford and Ilion, and cast out the odious automatic and pump guns. It was a pitched battle,--that of 1912, inaugurated by Ernest Napier, President of the State Game and Fish Commission and his fellow commissioners. The longer the contest continued, the more did the press and the people of New Jersey awaken to the seriousness of the situation. Finally, the gun-suppression bill passed the two houses of the legislature with a total of only fourteen votes against it, and after a full hearing had been granted the attorneys of the gunmakers, was promptly signed by Governor Woodrow Wilson. _Governor Wilson could not be convinced that the act was ""unconstitutional,"" or ""confiscatory"" or ""class legislation.""_ This contest aroused the whole state to the imperative necessity of providing more thorough protection for the remnant of New Jersey game, and it was chiefly responsible for the enactment of four other excellent new protective laws. New Jersey always has been sincere in her desire to protect her wild life, and always has gone _as far as the killers of game would permit her to go!_ But the People have made one great mistake,--common to nearly every state,--of permitting the game-killers to dictate the game laws! _Always and everywhere, this is a grievous mistake_, and fatal to the game. For example: In 1866 New Jersey enacted a five-year close-season law on the ""prairie fowl"" (pinnated grouse); but it was too late to save it. Now that species is as dead to New Jersey as is the mastodon. The moral is: Will the People apply this lesson to the ruffed grouse, quail and the shore birds generally before they, too, are too far gone to be brought back? If it is done, it must be done _against the will of the gunners;_ for they prefer to shoot,--and shoot they will if they can dictate the laws, until the last game bird is dead. In 1912, New Jersey is spending $30,000 in trying to restock her birdless covers with foreign game birds and quail. In brief, here are the imperative duties of New Jersey: Provide eight-year close seasons for quail, ruffed grouse, woodcock, snipe, all shore birds and the wood-duck. Prohibit the sale of all native wild game; but promote the sale of preserve-bred game. Prevent the repeal of the automatic gun law, which surely will be attempted, each year. Prohibit all bird-shooting after January 10, each year, until fall. Prohibit the killing of squirrels as ""game."" NEW MEXICO: All things considered, the game laws of New Mexico are surprisingly up to date, and the state is to be congratulated on its advanced position. For example, there are long close seasons on antelope, elk (now extinct!), mountain sheep, bob white quail, pinnated grouse, wild pigeon and ptarmigan,--an admirable list, truly. It is clear that New Mexico is wide awake to the dangers of the wild-life situation. On two counts, her laws are not quite perfect. There is no law prohibiting spring shooting, and there is no ""model law"" protecting the non-game birds. The sale of game will not trouble New Mexico, because the present laws prevent the sale of all protected game except plover, curlew and snipe,--all of them species by no means common in the arid regions of the Southwest. A law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be passed at the next session of the legislature. The enactment of the ""model law"" should be accomplished without delay to put New Mexico abreast of the neighboring states of Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. The term of the State Warden should be extended to four years. NEW YORK: In the year of grace, 1912, I think we may justly regard New York as the banner state of all America in the protection of game and wild life in general. This proud position has been achieved partly through the influence of a great conservation Governor, John A. Dix, and the State Conservation Commission proposed and created by his efforts. In these days of game destruction, when our country from Nome to Key West is reeking with the blood of slaughtered wild creatures, it is a privilege and a pleasure to be a citizen of a state which has thoroughly cleaned house, and done well nigh the utmost that any state can do to clear her bad record, and give all her wild creatures a fair chance to survive. The people of the Empire State literally can point with pride to the list of things accomplished in the discharge of good-citizenship toward the remnant of wild life, and toward the future generations of New Yorkers. That we of to-day have borne our share of the burden of bringing about the conditions of 1912, will be a source of satisfaction, especially when the sword and shield hang useless upon the walls of Old Age. New York began to protect her deer in 1705 and her heath hens in 1708. In 1912 she stopped the killing of female deer, and of bucks having horns less than three inches in length. Spring shooting was stopped in 1903. A comprehensive law protecting non-game birds was enacted in 1862. New York's first law against the sale of certain game during close seasons was enacted in 1837. In 1911 New York enacted, with only one adverse vote, a law prohibiting the sale of all native wild game throughout the state, no matter where killed, and providing liberally for the encouragement of game-breeding, and the sale of preserve-bred game. In 1912 a new codification of the state game laws went into effect, through the initiative of Governor Dix and Conservation Commissioners Van Kennen, Moore and Fleming, assisted (as special counsel) by Marshall McLean, George A. Lawyer and John B. Burnham. This code contains many important new provisions, one of the most valuable of which is a clause giving the Conservation Commission power, at its discretion, to shorten or to close any open season on any species of game in any locality wherein that species seems to be threatened with extermination. This very valuable principle should be enacted into law in every state! In 1910, William Dutcher and T. Gilbert Pearson and the National Association of Audubon Societies won, after a struggle lasting five years, the passage of the ""Shea plumage bill,"" prohibiting the sale of aigrettes or other plumage of wild birds belonging to the same families as the birds of New York (Chap. 256). This law _should be duplicated in every state._ _Two things_ remain to be done in the state of New York. All the shore birds, quail and gray squirrels of the state should be given five-year close seasons, by the action of the State Conservation Commission. For the good name of the state, and the ethical standing of its sportsmen, as an example to other states, and the last remaining duty toward our wild life, the odious automatic and pump shotguns should be barred from use in hunting, unless their capacity is reduced to two shots without reloading. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXI NEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES (Concluded) NORTH CAROLINA: The game laws of North Carolina form a droll crazy-quilt of local and state measures, effective and ineffective. In 1909, a total of 77 local game laws were enacted, and only two of state-wide application. During the ten years ending in 1910, a total of 316 game laws were enacted! She sedulously endeavors to protect her quail, which do not migrate, but in Currituck County she persistently maintains the bloodiest slaughter-pen for waterfowl that exists anywhere on the Atlantic Coast. There is no bag limit on waterfowl, and unlimited spring shooting. So far as waterfowl are concerned, conditions could hardly be worse, except by the use of punt guns. Doves, _larks_ and _robins_ are shot and eaten as ""game"" from November 1 to March 1! Twenty-one counties have local restrictions on the sale of game, but the state at large has only one,--on quail. The market gunners of Currituck Sound are a scourge and a pest to the wild-fowl life of the Atlantic Coast. For their own money profit, they slaughter by wholesale the birds that annually fly through twenty-two states. It is quite useless to suggest anything to North Carolina in modern game laws. As long as a killable bird remains, she will not stop the slaughter. Her standing reply is ""It brings a lot of money into Currituck County; and the people want the money."" Even the members of the sportsmen's clubs can shoot wild fowl in Currituck County, quite without limit; and I am told that the privilege often is abused. Quite recently I heard of a member of one of the clubs who shot 164 ducks and geese in two days! Apparently any suggestions made to North Carolina would not be treated seriously, especially if they would tend really to elevate the sport of game shooting, or better protect the game. There is, however, a melancholy interest attached to the framing of good game laws, whether they ever are likely to be adopted or not. Here is the duty of North Carolina: Stop the killing of robins, doves and larks for food, absolutely and forever. This measure is necessary to agriculture and to the good name of the state. Stop the shooting of any game for sale, prohibit the possession of game for sale, and the sale of wild native game. Establish bag limits on all waterfowl, and on all other game birds and mammals. Prepare to protect, at an early date, the wild turkey and quail; for soon they will need it. Moreover, enact a law prohibiting the use of automatic and pump guns in hunting, covering the entire state. Provide a resident-license system and thereby make the game department self-sustaining, and render it possible to employ a salaried State Game Commissioner. It is quite wrong for the people of North Carolina to hold grudges against northern members of the ducking clubs of Currituck for the passage of the Bayne law. They had nothing whatever to do with it, and I can say this because I was in a position which enabled me to know. NORTH DAKOTA: In 1911, this sovereign state enacted a law _prohibiting the use of automobiles_ in hunting wild-fowl; also rifles. North Dakota was the first state to recognize officially the fact that the use of automobiles in hunting is a serious menace to some forms of wild life. Beyond all question, the machines do indeed bring an extra number of birds within reach of the gun! They increase the annual slaughter; and it is right and necessary to prohibit by law their use in hunting game of any kind. In Putman County, New York, I have seen them in action. A load of three or four gunners is whirled up to a likely mountain-side for ruffed grouse, and presently the banging begins. After an hour or so spent in combing out the birds, the hunters jump in, whirl away in a dust-cloud to another spot two miles away, and ""bang-bang-bang"" again. After that, a third locality; and so on, covering six or eight times the territory that a man in a buggy, or on foot, could possibly shoot over in the same time! North Dakota has done well, in the passage of that act. On certain other matters, she is not so sound. For instance: The killing of pinnated grouse should be stopped for ten years; and it should be done immediately. The killing of cranes as ""game"" should stop, instantly and forever. It is barbarous. Fifty dead birds in possession at one time is fully thirty too many. The game cannot stand such slaughter! All shore birds (_Order Limicolae_) should have at least a five-year close season, before they are exterminated. The use of machine guns in hunting should be stopped, forever. It is to the credit of the state that antelope are absolutely protected until 1920, and an unlimited close season has been accorded the quail, dove and swan. OHIO: I think that Ohio comes the nearest of all the states to being gameless. With but slight exceptions her laws are about as correct as those of most other states, but the desire to ""kill"" is so strong, and the majority of her gunners are so thoroughly selfish about their ""rights"" that the game has ruthlessly been swept away _according to law!_ Ohio is a striking example of the deplorable results of _legalized_ slaughter. The spirit of Ohio is like that of North Carolina. Her ""sportsmen"" will not have an automatic gun law! Oh, no! ""Limit the bag, shorten the season, and the gun won't matter!"" To-day, the visible game supply of Ohio does not amount to anything; and when the last game bird of that state falls before the greediest shooter, we shall say, ""A gameless state is just what you deserve!"" It is useless to make any suggestions to Ohio. Her shooting Shylocks want the last pound of flesh from wild life, and I think they will get it very soon. Ohio is in the area of barren states. The seed stock has been too thoroughly destroyed to be recuperated. I think that Ohio's last noteworthy exploit in lawmaking for the preservation (!) of her game was in 1904, when she put all her shore birds into the list of killable game, and bravely prohibited the shooting of doves _on the ground!_ Great is Ohio in game conservation! OKLAHOMA: For a state so young, the wild-life laws of Oklahoma are in admirable shape; but it is reasonably certain that there, as elsewhere, the game is being killed much faster than it is breeding. The new commonwealth must arouse, and screw up the brakes much tighter. Recently, an observing friend told me that on a trip of 250 miles westward from Lawton and back again, watching sharply for game all the way, he saw only five pinnated grouse! And this in a good season for ""prairie chickens."" Oklahoma must stop all spring shooting. The prairie chicken must have a ten-year close season, immediately. Next time, her legislature will pass the automatic gun bill that failed last year only because the session closed too soon for its consideration. Oklahoma is wise in giving long protection to her quail, and ""wild pigeon,"" and such protection should be made equally effective in the case of the dove. She is wise in rigidly enforcing her law against the exportation of game. The Wichita National Bison herd, near Cache, now contains forty head of bison, all in good condition. The nucleus herd consisted of fifteen head presented by the New York Zoological Society in 1907. OREGON: The results of the efforts that have been made by Oregon to provide special laws for each individual shooter are painful to contemplate. Like North Carolina, Oregon has attempted the impossible task of pleasing everybody, and at the same time protecting her wild life. The two propositions can be blended together about as easily as asphalt and water. The individual shooter desires laws that will permit him to shoot--_when_ he pleases, _where_ he pleases, and _what_ he pleases! If you meet those conditions all over a great state, then it is time to bid farewell to the game; for it surely is doomed. No, decidedly no! Do not attempt to pass game laws that will ""please everybody."" The more the game-hogs are _displeased_, the better for the game! The game-hogs form a very small and very insignificant minority of the whole People. Why please one man at the expense of ninety-nine others? The game of a state belongs to The People as a whole, not to the gunners alone. The great, patient,--and sometimes sleepy,--majority has vested rights in it, and it is for it to say how it shall and shall not be killed. Heretofore the gunning minority has been dictating the game laws of America, and the result is--progressive extermination. First of all, Oregon should bury the pernicious idea of individual and local laws. She should enact a concise, clearly cut, and thoroughly effective code of wild life laws, just as New York did last winter. Her game seasons should be uniform in application, all over the state. Every species of bird, mammal or fish that is threatened with extermination should be given a close season of from five to ten years. It is now time to protect the white goose and brant. Squirrels, band-tailed pigeons and doves should be perpetually protected. The State Game Commission should have power to close the shooting seasons on any species of game in any locality, whenever a species is threatened with extinction. The sale of native wild game, from all sources, should be permanently stopped, by a Bayne law. The use of automatic, ""autoloading"" and pump shot guns in hunting should be perpetually barred. PENNSYLVANIA: As a game protecting state, Pennsylvania is a close second to New York and Massachusetts. She protects all native game from sale; _she has the courage to prohibit aliens from owning guns; she bars out automatic shot-guns in hunting_; she makes refuges for deer, and feeds her quail in winter, and she permits the killing of no female deer, or fawns with horns less than three inches in length. Her splendid State Game Commission is fighting hard for a hunter's license law, and will win the fight for it at the next session of the legislature (1913). But there are certain things that Pennsylvania should do: She should stop all spring shooting. She must stop killing doves, blackbirds, wild turkeys, sandpipers, and all the squirrels save the red squirrel. She should give all her shore birds a rest of at least five years, for recuperation. She should enact a comprehensive Dutcher plumage law, stopping the sale of aigrettes. She should provide a resident license to furnish her Game Commission with adequate funds to carry on its work and exterminate game-killing vermin. RHODE ISLAND: Little Rhody needs some good, small bag limits; for now (1912) she has none! She should enact a Bayne law, a Pennsylvania law against aliens, and a New Jersey law against the automatic and pump guns. She should stop killing the beautiful wood-duck, and gray squirrel. She should stop all spring shooting of waterfowl. SOUTH CAROLINA: She should save her game while she still has some to save. First of all, stop spring shooting; secondly, enact a Bayne law. In the name of mystery, who is there in South Carolina who desires to kill grackles? And why? And where is the gentleman sportsman who has come down to killing foolish and tame little doves for ""sport?"" Stop it at once, for the credit of the state. Enact a dollar resident license law and thus provide adequate funds for game protection. South Carolina bag limits are all 50 per cent too high; and they should be reduced. It is strange to see one of the oldest of the states lagging in game protection, far behind such new states as New Mexico and Oklahoma; but South Carolina does lag. It is time for her to consider her position, and reform. SOUTH DAKOTA: South Dakota should stop all spring shooting. Her game-bag limits are really no limits at all! They should be reduced about 66 per cent without a moment's unnecessary delay. The two year term of the State Warden is too short for effective work. It should be extended to four years. Unless South Dakota wishes to repeat the folly of such states as Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, she needs to be up and doing. If her people want a gameless state, except for migratory waterfowl, all they need do is to slumber on, and they surely will have it. Why wait until greedy sportsmen have killed the last game bird of the state before seriously taking the matter in hand? In one act, all the shortcomings of the present laws can be corrected. South Dakota needs no Bayne law, because she prohibits at all times the sale or exportation of all wild game. TENNESSEE: In wild life protection, Tennessee has much to do. She made her start late in life, and what she needs to do is to draft with care and enact with cheerful alacrity certain necessary amendments. We notice that there are open seasons for _blackbirds, robins, doves and squirrels_! It seems incredible; but it is true. Behold the blackbird as a ""game"" bird, with a lawful open season from September 1 to January 1. Consider its stately carriage, its rapid flight on the wing, its running and hiding powers when attacked. As a test of marksmanship, as the real thing for the expert wing shot, is it not great? Will not any self-respecting dog be proud to point or retrieve them? And what flesh for the table! Fancy an able-bodied sportsman going out in a fifty-dollar hunting suit, carrying a fifteen-dollar gun behind a seven-dollar dog, and returning with a glorious bag of twenty-five blackbirds! Or robins! Or doves! Proud indeed, would we be to belong (which we don't) to a club of ""sportsmen"" who go out shooting blackbirds, and robins, and foolish little doves, as ""game!"" ""Game"" indeed, are those birds,--for little lads of seven who do not know better; but not for boys of twelve who have in their veins any inheritance of sporting blood. (I am proud of the fact that at twelve years of age,--and ever so keen to ""go hunting,""--I knew without being told that squirrels and doves were not _real_ ""game"" for real boys.) The killers of doves, squirrels, blackbirds and robins belong in the same class as the sparrow-and-linnet-killing Italians of Venice, Milan and Turin, and in that company we will leave them. Tennessee needs: A resident license system to provide funds for game protection. A salaried warden force. A law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl. A law protecting robins, doves and other non-game birds not covered by the present statute. TEXAS: I remember well when the great battle was fought in Texas by the gallant men and women of the State Audubon Society, to compel the people of Texas to learn the economic value to agriculture and cotton of the insectivorous birds. The name of the splendid Brigadier-General who led the Army of the Defense was Capt. M.B. Davis. That was in 1903. Since that great fight was won, Texas has been a partly reformed state, at times quite jealous of her bird life; but still she tolerates spring shooting and has not made adequate close seasons for her waterfowl; which is wrong. To-day, the people of Texas do not need to be told that forty-three species of birds feed on the cotton boll weevil; for they know it. On the whole, and for a southern state, the wild-life laws of Texas are in fairly good shape. On account of the absence of game-scourge markets, a Bayne law is not so imperatively necessary there as in certain other states. All the game of the state is protected from sale. We do assert, however, that if robins are slaughtered as F.L. Crow, the former Atlantan asserts, all robin shooting should be forever stopped; that the pinnated grouse should be given a seven-year close season, and that doves should be taken off the list of game birds and perpetually protected, both for economic and sentimental reasons, and also because the too weak and confiding dove is not a ""game"" bird for red-blooded men. Texas should enact without delay a law providing close seasons for ducks, geese and other waterfowl; A law prohibiting spring shooting, and A provision reducing the limit on deer to two bucks a season. UTAH: The laws of Utah are far from being up to the requirements of the present hour. One strange thing has happened in Utah. When I spent a week in Salt Lake City in 1888, and devoted some time to inquiring into game conditions, the laws of the state were very bad. At the mouth of Bear River, ducks were being slaughtered for the markets by the tens of thousands. The cold-blooded, wide open and utterly shameless way in which it was being done, right at the doors of Salt Lake City, was appalling. At the same time, the law permitted the slaughter of _spotted fawns_. I saw a huge drygoods box filled to the top with the flat skins of slaughtered innocents, _260 in number_, that a rascal had collected and was offering at fifty cents each. In reply to a question as to their use, he said: ""I tink de sportsmen like 'em for to make vests oud of."" He lived at Rawlins, Wyo. After a long and somnolent period, during which hundreds of thousands of ducks, geese, brant and other birds had been slaughtered for market at the Bear River shambles and elsewhere, the state awoke sufficiently to abate a portion of the disgrace by passing a bag-limit law (1897). And then came Nature's punishment upon Utah for that duck slaughter. The ducks of Great Salt Lake became afflicted with a terrible epidemic disease (intestinal coccidiosis) which swept off thousands, and stopped the use of Utah ducks as food! It was a ""duck plague,"" no less. It has prevailed for three years, and has not yet by any means been stamped out. It seems to be due to the fact that countless thousands of ducks have been feeding on the exposed alluvial flats at the mouth of the creek that drains off the _sewage of Salt Lake City_. The conditions are said to be terrible. To-day, Utah is so nearly destitute of big game that the subject is hardly worthy of mention. Of her upland game birds, only a fraction remains, and as her laws stand to-day, she is destined to become in the near future a gameless state. In a dry region like this, the wild life always hangs on by a slender thread, and it is easy to exterminate it! Utah should instantly stop the sale of game that she now legally provides for,--twenty-five shore birds and waterfowl per day to private parties! Deer should be given a ten-year close season, at once. All bag limits should instantly be reduced one-half. The sage grouse, quail, swans, woodcock, dove, and all shore birds should be given a ten-year close season,--and rigidly protected,--before the stock is all gone. The model law for the protection of non-game birds should be enacted at once. The absolute protection of elk, antelope and sheep (until 1913) should be extended for twenty years. Utah should create a big-game preserve, at once. If Utah proposes to save even a remnant of her wild life for posterity, she must be up and doing. VERMONT: In view of all conditions, it must be stated that the game laws of Vermont are, with but slight exceptions, in good condition. It is a pleasure to see that there is no spring shooting; that there is no ""open"" season of slaughter for the moose, caribou, wood-duck, swan, upland plover, dove or rail; that no buck deer with antlers less than three inches long may be killed; and that there is a law under which damages by deer to growing crops may be assessed and paid for by the county in which they occur. Moreover, if there is to be any killing of game, her bag limits are not extravagant. All the game protected by the state is immune from sale for food purposes, but preserve-reared game may legally be sold. We recommend the following new measures: Absolute close seasons of five-years' duration for ruffed grouse, quail, woodcock, snipe and all shore birds without a single exception. The gray squirrel should be perpetually protected,--because he is too beautiful, too companionable and too unfit for food to be killed. Even the hungry savages of the East Indies do not eat squirrels. Pass an automatic pump-gun law. Extend the term of the Fish and Game Commissioner to four years. Vermont's great success in introducing and colonizing deer is both interesting and valuable. Fifty years ago, she had no wild deer, because the species had been practically exterminated. In 1875, thirteen deer were imported from the Adirondacks and set free in the mountains. The increase has been enormous. In 1909 the number of deer killed for the year was about 5,311, which was possible without adversely affecting the herds. It is a striking object-lesson in restoring the white-tailed deer to its own, and it will be found more fully described in chapter XXIV. VIRGINIA: Virginia is far below the position that she should occupy in wild-life conservation. To set her house in order, and come up to the level of the states that have been born during the past twenty years, she must bestir herself in these ways: She must provide for a resident hunting license, a State Game Commissioner and a force of salaried wardens. She must prohibit spring shooting. She must impose small bag limits on game-slaughter. She must resolutely stop the sale of all wild game. She must stop the killing of female deer, and of bucks with horns under three inches long. She must stop killing gray squirrels and doves as ""game."" She should not permit the beautiful wood-duck to be killed as ""game."" She should accord a five-year close season to grouse, and all shore birds. She should rule out the machine shot-guns which gentlemen can no longer use in hunting. She should adopt at once a comprehensive code of game laws, and clean her house in one siege, instead of fiddling and fussing with all these matters one by one, through a series of ten long, weary years. The time for puttering with game protection has gone by. It is now time to make short cuts to comprehensive results, and save the game before it is too late. WASHINGTON: The state of Washington still flatters herself that she has all kinds of big game to kill,--moose, antelope, goat, sheep, caribou and deer. Evidently this is on the theory that so long as a species is not extinct, it is ""legal"" and right to pursue it with rifles during a specified ""open season."" The people of Washington need to be told that conditions have greatly changed, and it is now high time to put on the brakes. It is time for them to realize that if they wait any longer for the sportsmen to take the initiative in securing the enactment of really adequate preservation laws, all their big game will be dead before those laws are born! Every man shrinks from cutting off his own pet privilege. Some of the game laws of Washington are up to date; and her big-game laws look all right to the unaided eye, but are not. Her bird laws are a chaotic jumble of local exceptions and special privileges. As a net result of all her shortcomings, the remnant of a once fine fauna of big game and feathered game is surely being _exterminated according to law._ A few local exceptions will not disprove the general truthfulness of this assertion. Ten years ago a few men in Seattle resented the idea of outside co-operation in the protection of Washington game. They said they were abundantly able to take care of it; but the march of events has proven that they overestimated their capacity. To-day the wild-life laws of that state are only half baked. Come what may to me, I shall set down without malice the things that the great and admirable State of Washington should do to set her house in order. It is not good for the resourceful and progressive men of the Great Northwest to be clear behind the times in these matters. _Stop local game legislation, and enact a code of laws covering the entire state, uniformly. County legislation is twenty years behind the times!_ For ten (10) full years, stop the killing of elk, mountain sheep, mountain goat, caribou, moose, and antelope. Regarding deer, I am in doubt. Prohibit the sale of all wild game, no matter where killed, by the enactment of a Bayne law, complete, which will also Promote the breeding, killing and sale of domestic game for food purposes. Make a careful investigation of the present status of your sage grouse, every other grouse, quail, and all species of shore birds, then give a five-year close season, all over the state, to every species that is ""becoming scarce."" This will embrace certainly one-half of the whole number, if not two-thirds. Provide two bird refuges in the eastern portion of the state, where they are very greatly needed to supplement the good effects of the State Game Preserve established on Puget Sound in 1911. Bar the use in hunting of the odious automatic and pump shotguns that are now so generally in use all over the United States to the great detriment of the game and the people. WEST VIRGINIA: Considering the fact that West Virginia contains no plague-spot city for the consumption of commercial wild game, that the sale of all game is prohibited at all times, and the game of the state may not be exported for sale elsewhere, the wild life of West Virginia is reasonably secure from the market gunner,--if an adequate salaried warden force is provided. Without such a force her game must continue to be destroyed in the future as in the past to supply the markets of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. The deer law is excellent, and the non-game birds, and the dove and wood-duck are perpetually protected. One fly in the ointment is--spring shooting; which for ducks, geese and brant continues from September 1 to April 20. Unfortunately the law enacted in 1875 against spring shooting has been _repealed,_ and so has the resident hunting license law (1911). In view of the impossibility of imagining a good reason for the repeal of a good law, we recommend: That the law against spring shooting be re-enacted. That the resident hunter's license law be re-enacted, and the proceeds specifically devoted to the preservation and increase of game. That a force of regular salaried wardens be provided to enforce the laws. That the bag limit on quail should be 10 per day or 40 per season, instead of 12 and 96; and on ruffed grouse it should be 3 per day (as in New York) or 12 per season. One wild turkey per day, or three per season is quite enough for one man. The visible supply will not justify the existing limit of two and six. WISCONSIN: In spite of the fierce fight made in 1910-11 by the saloon-element game-shooters of Milwaukee for the control of the wild-life situation, and the repeal of the best protective laws of the state, the Army of Defense once more defeated the Allied Destroyers, and drove them off the field. Once more it was proven that when The People are aroused, they are abundantly able to send the steam roller over the enemies of wild life. Alphabetically, Wisconsin may come near the end of the roll-call; but by downright merit in protection, she comes mighty close to the head of the list of states. Her slate of ""Work to be done"" is particularly clean; and she has our most distinguished admiration. Her force of game wardens is not a political-machine force. It amounts to something. The men who get within it undergo successfully a civil service examination that certainly separates the sheep from the goats. For particulars address Dr. T.S. Palmer, Department of Agriculture, Washington. According to the standards that have been dragging along previous to this moment, Wisconsin has a good series of game laws. But the hour for a Reformation of ideas and principles has struck. We heard it first in April, 1911. The wild life of America must not be exterminated according to law, contrary to law, or in the absence of law! Wisconsin must take a fresh grip on her game situation, or it will get away from her, after all. Not another prairie chicken or woodcock should be killed in Wisconsin between 1912 and 1922. When any small bird becomes so scarce that the bag limit needs to be cut down to five, as it now is for the above in Wisconsin, it is time to stop for ten years, before it is too late. Wisconsin should immediately busy herself about the creation of bird and game preserves. For goodness sake, Wisconsin, stop killing squirrels as ""game!"" You ought to know better--and you do! Leave that form of barbarism for the Benighted States. And pass a law shutting out the machine guns. They are a disgrace to our country, and a scourge to our game. Continually are they leading good men astray. Extend the term of your State Warden to four years. WYOMING: The State of Wyoming once had a magnificent heritage of game. It embraced the Rocky Mountain species, and also those of the great plains. First and last, the state has worked hard to protect her wild life, and hold the killing of it down to a decent basis. As far back as 1889, I met on the Shoshone River a very wide-awake warden, actually ""on his job,"" who was maintained by a body of private citizens headed by Col. Pickett and known as the Northern Wyoming Game Protective Association. And even then we saw that the laws were too liberal for the game. In one man's cold-storage dug-out we saw enough sheep, deer and elk meat to subsist a company of hungry dragoons, all killed and possessed according to law. In the protection of her mountain game, Wyoming has had a hard task. In the Yellowstone Park between 1889 and 1894, the poachers for the taxidermists of Livingston and elsewhere slaughtered 270 bison out of 300; and Howell was the only man caught. England can protect game in far-distant mountains and wildernesses; but America can not,--or at least _we don't!_ With us, men living in remote places who find wild game about them say ""To h--- with the law!"" They kill on the sly, in season and out of season, females and males; and the average local jury simply _will not_ convict the average settler who is accused of such a trifling indiscretion as killing game out of season when he ""needs the meat."" And so, with laws in full force protecting females, the volume of big game steadily disappears, _everywhere west of the Alleghanies where the law permits big-game hunting!_ An interesting chapter might be written on game exterminated according to law. The deadly defects in the protection of western big game are: Structural weakness in the enforcement of the laws; Collusion between offenders for the suppression of evidence; Perjury on the witness stand; Dishonesty and disloyalty on the part of local jurors when friends, are on trial; Sympathy of judges for ""the poor man"" who wants to eat the game to save his cattle and sheep. [Illustration: (Map of) STATES AND PROVINCES WHICH REQUIRE RESIDENTS TO OBTAIN HUNTING LICENSES, 1912 In Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma and Rhode Island an additional fee of 10 to 20 cents is charged for issuing the license. Inclosed names indicate States which permit residents to hunt on their own land without license. Nova Scotia has a $5 resident license and exempts landowners. Note that many of the States adopt the French method of exempting landowners, while some, particularly in the West follow the English method of requiring everyone who hunts to obtain a license. From Farmers' Bulletin No. 510, U-S. Dept. of Agriculture] Elsewhere there appears a statement regarding the elk of Jackson Hole, and the efforts made and being made to save them. At this point we are interested in the game of Wyoming as a whole. First of all, the killing of mountain sheep should absolutely cease, for ten years. A similar ten-year close season should be accorded moose and prong-horned antelope. All grouse should now be classed with doves and swans (no open season), and kept there for ten years. Spring shooting is wrong in principle and vicious in practice; and it should be stopped in Wyoming, as elsewhere. The automatic and pump shotguns when used in hunting are a disgrace to Wyoming, as they are to other states, and should be suppressed; and the silencer for use in hunting is in the black list. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXII NEED FOR A FEDERAL MIGRATORY BIRD LAW, NO-SALE-OF-GAME LAW, AND OTHERS We are assuming that the American people sincerely desire the adequate protection and increase of bird life, for reasons that are both sentimental and commercial. Surely every good citizen dislikes to see millions of dollar's worth of national wealth foolishly wasted, and he dislikes to pay any unnecessary increased cost of living. There must be several millions of Americans who feel that way, and who are disposed to demand a complete revolution in bird protection. There are four needs of wild bird life that are fundamental, and that can not be ignored, any more than a builder can ignore the four cornerstones of his building. Listed in the order of their importance, they are as follows: 1.--_The federal protection of all migratory birds._ 2.--_The total suppression of the sale of native wild game_. 3.--_The total suppression of spring shooting and of shooting in the breeding season, and_ 4.--_Long close seasons for all species that are about to be ""shot out_."" If the gunners of America wish to have a gameless continent, all they need do to secure it is to oppose these principles, prevent their translation into law, and maintain the status quo. If they do this, then _all our best birds are doomed to swift destruction_. Let no man make a mistake on that point. The ""open seasons"" and ""bag limits"" of the United States to-day are just as deadly as the 5,000,000 sporting guns now in use, and the 700,000,000 annual cartridges. It is only the ignorant or the vicious who will seriously dispute this statement. THE FEDERAL PROTECTION OF MIGRATORY BIRDS.--The bill now before Congress for the protection of all migratory birds by the national government is the most important measure ever placed before that body in behalf of wild life. A stranger to this proposition will need to pause for thought in order to grasp its full meaning, and appreciate the magnitude of its influence. The urgent necessity for a law of this nature is due to the utter inadequacy of the laws that prevail throughout some portions of the United States concerning the slaughter and preservation of birds. Any law that is not enforced is a poor law. There is not one state in the Union, nor a single province in Canada, in which the game birds, and other birds criminally shot as game, are not being killed far faster than they are breeding, and thereby being exterminated. Several states are financially unable to employ a force of salaried game wardens; and wherever that is true, the door to universal slaughter is wide open. Let him who questions this take Virginia as a case in point. A loyal Virginian told me only this year that in his state the warden system is an ineffective farce, and the game is not protected, because the wardens can not afford to patrol the state for nothing. This condition prevails in a number of states, north and south, especially south. It is my belief that throughout nine-tenths of the South, the negroes and poor whites are slaughtering birds exactly as they please. It is the _permanent residents_ of the haunts of birds and game that are exterminating the wild life. The value of the birds as destroyers of noxious insects, has been set forth in Chapter XXIII. Their total value is enormous--or it _would_ be if the birds were alive and here in their normal numbers. To-day there are about one-tenth as many birds as were alive and working thirty years ago. During the past thirty years the destruction of our game birds has been enormous, and the insectivorous birds have greatly decreased. The damages annually inflicted upon the farm, orchard and garden crops of this country are very great. When a city is destroyed by earthquake or fire, and $100,000,000 worth of property is swept away, we are racked with horror and pity; and the cities of America pour out money like water to relieve the resultant distress. We are shocked because we can _see_ the flames, the smoke and the ruins. And yet, we annually endure with perfect equanimity (_because we can not see it_?) a loss of nearly $400,000,000 worth of value that is destroyed by insects. The damage is inflicted silently, insidiously, without any scare heads or wooden type in the newspapers, and so we pay the price without protest. We know--when we stop to think of it--that not all this loss falls upon the producer. We know that every consumer of bread, cereals, vegetables and fruit _pays his share of this loss_! To-day, millions of people are groaning under the ""increased cost of living."" The bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds is directly intended to decrease the cost of living, by preventing outrageous waste; but of all the persons to whom the needs of that bill are presented, how many will take the time to promote its quick passage by direct appeals to their members of Congress? We shall see. The good that would be accomplished, annually, by the enactment of a law for the federal protection of all migratory birds is beyond computation; but it is my belief that within a very few years the increase in bird life would prevent what is now an annual loss of $250,000,000. It is beyond the power of man to protect his crops and fruit and trees as the bird millions would protect them--if they were here as they were in 1870. The migratory bird bill is of vast importance because it would throw the strong arm of federal protection around 610 species of birds. The power of Uncle Sam is respected and feared in many places where the power of the state is ignored. The list of migratory birds includes most of the perching birds; all the shore birds (_great_ destroyers of bad insects); all the swifts and swallows; the goat-suckers (whippoorwill and nighthawk); some of the woodpeckers; most of the rails; pigeons and doves; many of the hawks; some of the cranes and herons and all the geese, ducks and swans. A movement for the federal protection of migratory game birds was proposed to Congress by George Shiras, 3rd, who as a member of the House in the 58th Congress introduced a bill to secure that end. An excellent brief on that subject by Mr. Shiras appeared in the printed hearing on the McLean bill, held on March 6, 1912, page 18. Omitting the bills introduced in the 59th, 60th and 61st sessions, mention need be made only of the measures under consideration in the present Congress. One of these is a bill introduced by Representative J.W. Weeks, of Massachusetts, and another is the bill of Representative D.R. Anthony, Jr., of Kansas, of the same purport. Finally, on April 24, 1912, an adequate and entirely reasonable bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator George P. McLean, of Connecticut, as No. 6497 (Calendar No. 606). This bill provides federal protection for _all_ migratory birds, and embraces all save a very few of the species that are specially destructive to noxious insects. The bill provides national protection to the farmer's and fruit-grower's best friends. It is entitled to the enthusiastic support of 90,000,000 of people, native and alien. Every producer of farm products and every consumer of them owes it to himself to write at once to his member of Congress and ask him (1) to urge the speedy consideration of the bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds, (2) to vote for it, and (3) to work for it until it is passed. It matters not which one of the three bills described finally becomes a law. Will the American people act rationally about this matter, and protect their own interests? SUPPRESS THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME.--The deadly effect of the commercial slaughter of game and its sale for food is now becoming well understood by the American people. One by one the various state legislatures have been putting up the bars against the exportation or sale of any ""game protected by the state."" The U.S. Department of Agriculture says, through Henry Oldys, that ""free marketing of wild game leads swiftly to extermination;"" and it is literally true. Up to March, 1911, it appears that several states prohibited the sale of game, sixteen states permitted the sale of all unprotected game, and in eight more there was partial prohibition. Unfortunately, however, many of these states permitted the sale of _imported_ game. Now, since it happened to be a fact that the vast majority of the states prohibit the _export_ of their game, as well as the sale of it, a very large quantity of such game as quail, ruffed grouse, snipe, woodcock and shore birds was illegally shot for the market, exported in defiance both of state laws and the federal Lacey Act, and sold to the detriment of the states that produced it. In other words, in the laws of each state that merely sought to protect _their own_ game, regardless of the game of neighboring states, there was not merely a loop-hole, but there was a gap wide enough to drive through with a coach and four. The ruffed grouse of Massachusetts and Connecticut often were butchered to make Gotham holidays in joyous contempt of the laws at both ends of the line. As a natural result the game of the Atlantic coast was disappearing at a frightful rate. [Illustration: EIGHTEEN STATES ENTIRELY PROHIBIT THE SALE OF GAME WHY DO THE OTHERS LAG BEHIND?] In 1911, the no-sale-of-game law of New York was born out of sheer desperation. The Army of Destruction went up to Albany well-organized, well provided with money and attorneys, with three senators in the Senate and two assemblymen in the lower house, to wage merciless warfare on the whole wild-life cause. The market gunners and game dealers not only proposed to repeal the law against spring shooting but also to defeat all legislation that might be attempted to restrict the sale of game, or impose bag limits on wild fowl. The Milliners' Association proposed to wipe off the books the Dutcher law against the use of the plumage of wild birds in millinery, and an assemblyman was committed to that cause as its special champion. Then it was that all the friends of wild life in the Empire State resolved upon a death grapple with the Destroyers, and a fight to an absolute finish. The Bayne bill, entirely prohibiting the sale of all native wild game throughout the state of New York, was drafted and thrown into the ring, and the struggle began. At first the no-sale-of-game bill looked like sheer madness, but no sooner was it fairly launched than supporters came flocking in from every side. All the organizations of sportsmen and friends of wild life combined in one mighty army, the strength of which was irresistible. The real sportsmen of the state quickly realized that the no-sale bill was _directly in the interest of legitimate sport_. The great mass of people who love wild life, and never kill, were quick to comprehend the far-reaching importance of the measure, and they supported it, with money and enthusiasm. The members of the legislature received thousands of letters from their constituents, asking them to support the Bayne-Blauvelt bill. They did so. On its passage through the two houses, only _one_ vote was recorded against it! Incidentally, every move attempted by the Army of Destruction was defeated and in the final summing up the defeat amounted to an utter rout. In 1912, after a tremendous struggle, the legislature of Massachusetts passed a counterpart of the Bayne law, and took her place in the front rank of states. That was a great fight. The market-gunners of Cape Cod, the game dealers and other interests entered the struggle with men in the lower house of the legislature specially elected to look after their interests. Just as in New York in 1911, they proposed to repeal the existing laws against spring shooting and throw the markets wide open to the sale of game. From first to last, through three long and stormy months, the Destroyers fought with a degree of determination and persistence worthy of a better cause. They contested with the Defenders every inch of ground. In New York, the Destroyers were overwhelmed by the tidal wave of Defenders, but in Massachusetts it was a prolonged hand-to-hand fight on the ramparts. _Five times_ was a bill to repeal the spring-shooting law introduced and defeated! Even after the bill had passed both houses by good majorities, the Governor declared that he could not sign it. And then there poured into the Executive offices such a flood of callers, letters, telegrams and telephone calls that he became convinced that the People desired the law; so he signed the bill in deference to the wishes of the majority. The principle that the sale of game is wrong, and fatal to the existence of a supply of game, is as fixed and unassailable as the Rocky Mountains. Its universal acceptance is only a question of intelligence and common honesty. The open states owe it to themselves and each other to enact both the spirit and the letter of the Bayne law, _and do it quickly_, before it is too late to profit by it! Let them remember the heath hen,--amply protected when entirely too late to save it from extinction! It is fairly beyond question that the killing of wild game for the market, and its sale in the ""open season"" _and out of it_, is responsible for the disappearance of at least fifty per cent of our stock of American feathered game. It is the market-gunner, the game-hog who shoots ""for sport"" and sells his game, and the game dealer, who have swept away the wild ducks, the ruffed grouse, the quail and the prairie chickens that thirty years ago were abundant on their natural ranges. The foolish farmers of the middle West permitted the market-hunters of Chicago and the East to slaughter their own legitimate game by the barrel and the car-load, and ship it ""East,"" to market. To-day the waters of Currituck Sound are a wholesale slaughter-place for migratory wild fowl with which to supply the markets of Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia. Furthermore, the market gunners of Currituck are robbing the people of 16 states of tens of thousands of wild-fowl that legitimately belong to them, during the annual autumn flight. The accompanying map shows how it is done. [Illustration: MAP USED IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE BAYNE LAW This map shows how the sale of ducks killed on the Carrituck Sound robs the people of 16 states, for the benefit of a few. STOP THE SALE OF GAME! (Signed W.T. Hornaday, March 6, 1911.)] To-day, the cash rewards of the market-hunter who can reach a large city with his product are dangerously great. Observe the following _wholesale_ prices that prevailed in New York city in 1910, just prior to the passage of the Bayne law. They were compiled and published by Henry Oldys, of the Biological Survey. Grouse, domestic per pair $3.00 Grouse, foreign "" "" $1.25 to 1.75 Partridge, domestic "" "" 3.50 "" 4.00 Woodcock, domestic "" "" 1.50 "" 2.00 Golden plover per dozen 2.50 "" 3.50 English snipe "" "" 2.00 "" 3.00 Canvasback duck per pair 2.25 "" 3.00 Redhead duck "" "" 1.50 "" 2.50 Mallard duck "" "" "" 1.25 Bluewing teal "" "" .75 "" 1.00 Greenwing teal "" "" .75 "" .90 Broadbill duck "" "" .50 "" .75 Rail, No. 1 per dozen "" 1.00 Rail, No. 2 "" "" "" .60 Venison, whole deer per pound .22 "" .25 Venison, saddle "" "" .30 "" .35 All our feathered game is rapidly slipping away from us. _Are we going to save anything from the wreck_? Will we so weakly manage the game situation that later on there will be no legitimate bird-shooting for our younger sons, and our grandsons? All laws that permit the killing of game for the market, and the sale of it afterward, are class legislation of the worst sort. They permit a hundred men selfishly to slaughter for their own pockets the game that rightfully belongs to a hundred thousand men and boys who shoot for the legitimate recreation that such field sports afford. Will any of the sportsmen of America ""stand for"" this until the game is _all_ gone? The people who pay big prices for game in the hotels and restaurants of our big cities are not men who _need_ that game as food. Far from it. They can obtain scores of fine meat dishes without destroying the wild flocks. In civilized countries wild game is no longer necessary as ""food,"" to satisfy hunger, and ward off starvation. In the United States the day of the hungry Indian-fighting pioneer has gone by and there is an abundance of food everywhere. The time to temporize and feel timid over the game situation has gone by. The situation is desperate; and nothing but strong and vigorous measures will avail anything worth while. The sale of all wild game should be stopped, everywhere and at all seasons, throughout all North America, and throughout the world. To-day this particular curse is being felt even in India. It is the duty of every true sportsman, every farmer who owns a gun, and every lover of wild life, to enter into the campaign for the passage of bills absolutely prohibiting all traffic in wild game no matter what its origin. Of course the market hunters, the game-hogs and the game dealers will bitterly oppose them, and hire a lobby to attempt to defeat them. But the fight for no-sale-of-game is now on, and it must not stop short of complete victory. * * * * * REASONS WHY THE SALE OF WILD GAME SHOULD CEASE EVERYWHERE 1.--Because fully 95 per cent of our legitimate stock of feathered game has already been destroyed. 2.--Because if market-gunning and the sale of game continue ten years longer, all our feathered game will be swept away. 3.--Because when the sale of game was permitted one dealer was able to sell 1,000,000 _game birds per year in New York City_, so he himself said. 4.--Because it is a fixed fact that every wild species of mammal, bird or reptile that is pursued for money-making purposes eventually is wiped out of existence. Even the whales of the sea are no exception. 5.--Because at least 50 per cent of the decrease in our feathered game is due to market-gunning, and the sale of game. Look at the prairie chicken of the Mississippi Valley, and the ruffed grouse of New England. 6.--Because the laws that permit the commercial slaughter of wild birds for the benefit of less than five per cent of the inhabitants of any state are directly against the interest of the 95 per cent of other people, to _whom that game partly belongs_. 7.--Because game killed ""for sale"" is not intended to satisfy ""hunger."" The people who eat game in large cities do not know what hunger is, save by hearsay. Purchased game is used chiefly in over-feeding; and as a rule it does far more harm than good. 8.--Because the greatest value to be derived from any game bird is in seeing it, and photographing it, and enjoying its living company in its native haunts. Who will love the forests when they become destitute of wild life, and desolate? 9.--Because stopping the sale of game _will help bring back the game birds to us, in a few years_. 10.--Because the pace that New York and Massachusetts have set in this matter will render it easier to procure the passage of Bayne laws in other states. 11.--Because those who legitimately desire game for their tables can be supplied from the game farms and preserves that now are coming into existence. When New York's far-reaching Bayne bill became a law, the following dead birds lay in cold storage in New York City: Wild duck 98,156 Plover 48,780 Quail 14,227 Grouse 21,202 Snipe 7,825 Woodcock 767 Rail 419 ------- 191,376 They represented the last slaughterings of American game for New York. To-day the remaining plague-spots are Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore, Washington and New Orleans; but in New Orleans the brakes have at last (1912) been applied, and the market slaughter that formerly prevailed in that state has at least been checked. As an instance of persistent market shooting on the greatest ducking waters of the eastern United States, I offer this report from a trustworthy agent sent to Currituck Sound, North Carolina, in March, 1911. I beg to submit the following information relative to the number of wild ducks and geese shipped from this market and killed in the waters of Back Bay and the upper or north end of Currituck Sound, from October 20th to March 1st, inclusive. Approximately there were killed and shipped in the territory above named, 130,000 to 135,000 wild ducks and between 1400 and 1500 wild geese. From Currituck Sound and its tributaries there were shipped approximately 200,000 wild ducks. You will see from the above figures that each year the market shooter exacts a tremendous toll from the wild water fowl in these waters, and it is only a question of a short time when the wild duck will be exterminated, unless we can stop the ruthless slaughter. The last few years I have noted a great decrease in the number of wild ducks; some of the species are practically extinct. I have secured the above information from a most reliable source, and the figures given approximately cannot be questioned. The effect of the passage of the Bayne law, closing the greatest American market against the sale of game was an immediate decrease of fully fifty per cent in the number of ducks and geese slaughtered on Currituck Sound. The dealers refused to buy the birds, and one-half the killers were compelled to hang up their guns and go to work. The duck-slaughterers felt very much enraged by the passage of the law, and at first were inclined to blame the northern members of Currituck ducking clubs for the passage of the measure; but as a matter of fact, not one of the persons blamed took any part whatever in the campaign for the new law. THE UNFAIRNESS OF SPRING SHOOTING.--The shooting of game birds in late winter and spring is to be mentioned only to be condemned. It is grossly unfair to the birds, outrageous in principle, and most unsportsmanlike, no matter whether the law permits it or not. Why it is that any state like Iowa, for example, can go on killing game in spring is more than I can understand. I have endeavored to find a reason for it, in Iowa, but the only real reason is:--""The boys want the birds!"" I think we have at last reached the point where it may truthfully be said that now no gentleman shoots birds in spring. If the plea is made that ""if we don't shoot ducks in the spring we can't shoot them at all!"" then the answer is--if you can't shoot game like high-minded, red-blooded sportsman, _don't shoot it at all_! A gentleman can not afford to barter his standing and his own self-respect for a few ducks shot in the spring when the birds are going north to lay their eggs. And the man who insists on shooting in spring may just as well go right on and do various other things that are beyond the pale, such as shoot quail on the ground, shoot does and fawns, and fish for trout with gang hooks. There are no longer two sides to what once was the spring shooting question. Even among savages, the breeding period of the wild creatures is under taboo. Then if ever may the beasts and birds cry ""King's excuse!"" It has been positively stated in print that high-class fox hounds have been known to refuse to chase a pregnant fox, even when in full view. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXIII BRINGING BACK THE VANISHED BIRDS AND GAME The most charming trait of wild-life character is the alacrity and confidence with which wild birds and mammals respond to the friendly advances of human friends. Those who are not very familiar with the mental traits of our wild neighbors may at first find it difficult to comprehend the marvelous celerity with which both birds and mammals recognize friendly overtures from man, and respond to them. At the present juncture, this state of the wild-animal mind becomes a factor of great importance in determining what we can do to prevent the extermination of species, and to promote the increase and return of wild life. I think that there is not a single wild mammal or bird species now living that can not, or does not, quickly recognize protection, _and take advantage of it_. The most conspicuous of all familiar examples are the wild animals of the Yellowstone Park. They embrace the elk, mountain sheep, antelope, mule deer, the black bear and even the grizzly. No one can say precisely how long those several species were in ascertaining that it was safe to trust themselves within easy rifle-shot of man; but I think it was about five years. Birds recognize protection far more quickly than mammals. In a comparatively short time the naturally wild and wary big game of the Yellowstone Park became about as tame as range cattle. It was at least fifteen years ago that the mule deer began to frequent the parade ground at the Mammoth Hot Springs military post, and receive there their rations of hay. Whenever you see a beautiful photograph of a large band of big-horn sheep or mule deer taken at short range amid Rocky Mountain scenery, you are safe in labeling it as having come from the Yellowstone Park. The prong-horned antelope herd is so tame that it is difficult to keep it out of the streets of Gardiner, on the Montana side of the line. But the bears! Who has not heard the story of the bears of the Yellowstone Park,--how black bears and grizzlies stalk out of the woods, every day, to the garbage dumping-ground; how black bears actually have come _into the hotels_ for food, without breaking the truce, and how the grizzlies boldly raid the grub-wagons and cook-tents of campers, taking just what they please, because they _know_ that no man dares to shoot them! Indeed, those raiding bears long ago became a public nuisance, and many of them have been caught in steel box-traps and shipped to zoological gardens, in order to get them out of the way. And yet, outside the Park boundaries, everywhere, the bears are as wary and wild as the wildest. The arrogance of the bears that couldn't be shot once led to a droll and also exciting episode. During the period when Mr. C.J. Jones (""Buffalo"" Jones) was superintendent of the wild animals of the Park, the indignities inflicted upon tourist campers by certain grizzly bears quite abraded his nerves. He obtained from Major Pitcher authority to punish and reform a certain grizzly, and went about the matter in a thoroughly Buffalo-Jonesian manner. He procured a strong lariat and a bean-pole seven feet long and repaired to the camp that was troubled by too much grizzly. The particular offender was a full-grown male grizzly who had become a notorious raider. At the psychological moment Jones lassoed him in short order, getting a firm hold on the bear's left hind leg. Quickly the end of the rope was thrown over a limb of the nearest tree, and in a trice Ephraim found himself swinging head downward between the heavens and the earth. And then his punishment began. Buffalo Jones thrashed him soundly with the bean-pole! The outraged bear swung to and fro, whirled round and round, clawing and snapping at the empty air, roaring and bawling with rage, scourged in flesh and insulted in spirit. As he swung, the bean-pole searched out the different parts of his anatomy with a wonderful degree of neatness and precision. Between rage and indignation the grizzly nearly exploded. A moving-picture camera was there, and since that day that truly moving scene has amazed and thrilled countless thousands of people. When it was over, Mr. Jones boldly turned the bear loose! Although its rage was as boundless as the glories of the Yellowstone Park, it paused not to rend any of those present, but headed for the tall timber, and with many an indignant ""Woof! Woof!"" it plunged in and disappeared. It was two or three years before that locality was again troubled by impudent grizzly bears. And what is the mental attitude of _every_ Rocky Mountain black or grizzly bear _outside_ of the Yellowstone Park? It is colossal suspicion of man, perpetual fear, and a clean pair of heels the moment man-scent or man-sight proclaims the proximity of the Arch Enemy of Wild Creatures. And yet there are one or two men who tell the American public that wild animals do not think, that they do not reason, and are governed only by ""instinct""! ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing!"" TAMING WILD BIRDS.--As incontestable proof of the receptive faculties of birds, I will cite the taming of wild birds in the open, by friendly advances. There are hundreds, aye, thousands, of men, women, boys and girls who could give interesting and valuable personal testimony on this point. My friend J. Alden Loring (one of the naturalists of the Roosevelt African Expedition), is an ardent lover of wild birds and mammals. The taming of wild creatures in the open is one of his pastimes, and his results serve well to illustrate the marvelous readiness of our wild neighbors to become close friends with man _when protected_. I will quote from one of Mr. Loring's letters on this subject: ""Taming wild birds is a new field in nature study, and one never can tell what success he will have until he has experimented with different species. Some birds tame much more easily than others. On three or four occasions I have enticed a chickadee _to my hand_ at the first attempt, while in other cases it has taken from fifteen minutes to a whole day. ""Chipping sparrows that frequent my doorway I have tamed in two days. A nuthatch required three hours before it would fly to my hand, although it took food from my stick the first time it was offered. When you find a bird on her nest, it is of course much easier to tame that individual than if you had to follow it about in the open, and wait for it to come within reach of a stick. By exercising extreme caution, and approaching inch by inch, I have climbed a tree to the nest of a yellow-throated vireo, and at the first attempt handed the bird a meal-worm with my fingers. At one time I had two house wrens, a yellow-throated vireo, a chipping sparrow and a flock of chickadees that would come to my hand."" [Illustration: SIX WILD CHIPMUNKS DINE WITH MR. LORING] It would be possible--and also delightful--to fill a volume with citations of evidence to illustrate the quick acceptance of man's protection by wild birds and mammals. Let me draw a few illustrations from my own wild neighbors. On Lake Agassiz, in the N.Y. Zoological Park, within 500 feet of my office in the Administration Building, a pair of wild wood-ducks made their nest last spring, and have just finished rearing nine fine, healthy young birds. Whenever you see a wood-duck rise and fly in our Park, you may know that it is a wild bird. During the summer of 1912 a small flock of wild wood-ducks came every night to our Wild-Fowl Pond, and spent the night there. A year ago, a covey of eleven quail appeared in the Park, and have persistently remained ever since. Last fall and winter they came at least twenty times to a spot within forty feet of the rear window of my office, in order to feed upon the wheat screenings that we placed there for them. When we first occupied the Zoological Park grounds, in 1899, there was not one wild rabbit in the whole 264 acres. Presently the species appeared, and rabbits began to hop about confidently, all over the place. In 1906, we estimated that there were about eighty individuals. Then the marauding cats began to come in, and they killed off the rabbits until not one was to be seen. Thereupon, we addressed ourselves to those cats, in more serious earnest than ever before. Now the cats have disappeared; and one day last spring, as I left my office at six o'clock, everyone else having previously gone, I almost stepped upon two half-grown bunnies that had been visiting on the front door-mat. When we were macadamizing the yards around the Elephant House, with a throng of workmen all about every day, a robin made its nest on the heavy channel-iron frame of one of the large elephant gates that swung to and fro nearly every day. In 1900 we planted a young pine tree in front of our temporary office building, within six feet of a main walk; and at once a pair of robins nested in it and reared young there. [Illustration: WILD CREATURES QUICKLY RESPOND TO FRIENDLY ADVANCES Chickadee and Chipmunk Tamed by Mr. Loring] [Illustration: THE COLORADO OBJECT LESSON IN BRINGING BACK THE DUCKS] Up in Putnam County, where for five years deer have been protected, the exhibitions that are given each year of the supreme confidence of protected deer literally astonish the natives. They are almost unafraid of man and his vehicles, his cattle and his horses, but of course they are unwilling to be handled. Strangers are astonished; but people who know something about the mental attitude of wild animals under protection know that it is the natural and inevitable result of _real protection_. At Mr. Frank Seaman's summer home in the Catskills, the phoebe birds nest on the beams under the roof of the porch. At my summer home in the Berkshires, no sooner was our garage completed than a phoebe built her nest on the edge of the lintel over the side door; and another built on a drain-pipe over the kitchen door. Near Port Jervis, last year a wild ruffed grouse nested and reared a large brood in the garden of Mr. W.I. Mitchell, within _two feet_ of the foundation of the house. On the Bull River in the wilds of British Columbia two trappers of my acquaintance, Mack Norboe and Charlie Smith, once formed a friendship with a wild weasel. In a very few visits, the weasel found that it was among friends, and the trappers' log cabin became its home. I have a photograph of it, taken while it posed on the door-sill. The trappers said that often when returning at nightfall from their trap-lines, the weasel would meet them a hundred yards away on the trail, and follow them back to the cabin. ""Old Ben,"" the big sea-lion who often landed on the wharf at Avalon, Santa Catalina, to be fed on fish, was personally known to thousands of people. AN OBJECT LESSON IN PROTECTION.--A remarkable object lesson in the recognition of protection by wild ducks came under my notice in the pages of ""Recreation Magazine"" in June, 1903, when that publication was edited by G.O. Shields. The article was entitled,--"" A Haven of Refuge,"" and the place described well deserved the name. It is impossible for me to impress upon the readers of this volume with sufficient force and clearness the splendid success that is easily attainable in encouraging the return of the birds. The story of the Mosca ""Haven of Refuge"" was so well told by Mr. Charles C. Townsend in the publication referred to above, that I take pleasure in reproducing it entire. One mile north of the little village of Mosca, Colorado, in San Luis valley, lives the family of J.C. Gray. On the Gray ranch there is an artesian well which empties into a small pond about 100 feet square. This pond is never entirely frozen over and the water emptying therein is warm even during the coldest winter. Some five years ago, Mr. Gray secured a few wild-duck eggs, and hatched them under a hen. The little ducks were reared and fed on the little pond. The following spring they left the place, to return in the fall, bringing with them broods of young; also bringing other ducks to the home where protection was afforded them, and plenty of good feed was provided. Each year since, the ducks have scattered in the spring to mate and rear their families, returning again with greatly increased numbers in the fall, and again bringing strangers to the haven of refuge. I drove out to the ranch November 24, 1902, and found the little pond almost black with the birds, and was fortunate enough to secure a picture of a part of the pond while the ducks were thickly gathered thereon. Ice had formed around the edges, and this ice was covered with ducks. The water was also alive with others, which paid not the least attention to the party of strangers on the shore. From Mr. Gray I learned that there were some 600 ducks of various kinds on the pond at that time, though it was then early for them to seek winter quarters. Later in the year, he assured me, there would be between 2,000 and 3,000 teal, mallards, canvas-backs, redheads and other varieties, all perfectly at home and fearless of danger. The family have habitually approached the pond from the house, which stands on the south side, and should any person appear on the north side of the pond the ducks immediately take fright and flight. Wheat was strewn on the ground and in the water, and the ducks waddled around us within a few inches of our feet to feed, paying not the least attention to us, or to the old house-dog which walked near. Six miles east of the ranch is San Luis lake, to which these ducks travel almost daily while the lake is open. When they are at the lake it is impossible to approach within gunshot of the then timid birds. Some unsympathetic boys and men have learned the habit of the birds, and place themselves in hiding along the course of flight to and from the lake. Many ducks are shot in this way, but woe to the person caught firing a gun on or near the home-pond. When away from home, the birds are as other wild-ducks and fail to recognize any members of the Gray family. While at home they follow the boys around the barn-yard, squawking for feed like so many tame ducks. This is the greatest sight I have ever witnessed, and one that I could not believe existed until I had seen it. Certainly it is worth travelling many miles to see, and no one, after seeing it, would care to shoot birds that, when kindly treated, make such charming pets. Since the above was published, the protected flocks of tame wild ducks have become one of the most interesting sights of Florida. At Palm Beach the tameness of the wild ducks when within their protected area, and their wildness outside of it, has been witnessed by thousands of visitors. THE SAVING OF THE SNOWY EGRET IN THE UNITED STATES.--The time was when very many persons believed that the devastations of the plume-hunters of Florida and the Gulf Coast would be so long continued and so persistently followed up to the logical conclusion that both species of plume-furnishing egrets would disappear from the avifauna of the United States. This expectation gave rise to feelings of resentment, indignation and despair. It happened, however, that almost at the last moment a solitary individual set on foot an enterprise calculated to preserve the snowy egret (which is the smaller of the two species involved), from final extermination. The splendid success that has attended the efforts of Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny, of Avery Island, Louisiana, is entitled not only to admiration and praise, but also to the higher tribute of practical imitation. Mr. McIlhenny is, first of all, a lover of birds, and a humanitarian. He has traveled widely throughout the continent of North America and elsewhere, and has seen much of wild life and man's influence upon it. To-day his highest ambition is to create for the benefit of the Present, and as a heritage to Posterity, a mid-continental chain of great bird refuges, in which migrating wild fowl and birds of all other species may find resting-places and refuges during their migrations, and protected feeding-grounds in winter. In this grand enterprise, the consummation of which is now in progress, Mr. McIlhenny is associated with Mr. Charles Willis Ward, joint donor of the splendid Ward-McIlhenny Bird Preserve of 13,000 acres, which recently was presented to the State of Louisiana by its former owners. The egret and heron preserve, however, is Mr. McIlhenny's individual enterprise, and really furnished the motif of the larger movement. Of its inception and development, he has kindly furnished me the following account, accompanied by many beautiful photographs of egrets breeding in sanctuary, one of which appears on page 27. In some recent publications I have seen statements to the effect that you believed the egrets were nearing extinction, owing to the persecution of plume hunters, so I know that you will be interested in the enclosed photographs, which were taken in my heron rookery, situated within 100 yards of my factory, where I am now sitting dictating this letter. This rookery was started by me in 1896, because I saw at that time that the herons of Louisiana were being rapidly exterminated by plume hunters. My thought was that the way to preserve them would be to start an artificial rookery of them where they could be thoroughly protected. With this end in view I built a small pond, taking in a wet space that contained a few willows and other shrubs which grow in wet places. In a large cage in this pond, I raised some snowy herons. After keeping the birds in confinement for something over six months I turned them loose, hoping that they would come back the next season, as they were perfectly tame and were used to seeing people. I was rewarded the next season by four of the birds returning, and nesting in the willows in the pond. This was the start of a rookery that now covers 35 acres, and contains more than twenty thousand pairs of nesting birds, embracing not only the egrets but all the species of herons found in Louisiana, besides many other water birds. With a view to carrying on the preservation of our birds on a larger scale, Mr. Chas. W. Ward and I have recently donated to the State of Louisiana 13,000 acres of what I consider to be the finest wild fowl feeding ground on the Louisiana coast, as it contains the only gravel beach for 50 miles, and all of the geese within that space come daily to this beach for gravel. This territory also produces a great amount of natural food for geese and ducks. SAVING THE GULLS AND TERNS.--But for the vigorous and long-continued efforts of the Audubon Societies, I think our coasts would by this time have been swept clean of the gulls and terns that now adorn it. Twenty years ago the milliners were determined to have them all. The fight for them was long, and hotly contested, but the Audubon Societies won. It was a great victory, and has yielded results of great value to the country at large. And yet, it was only a small number of persons who furnished the money and made the fight which inured to the benefit of the millions of American people. Hereafter, whenever you see an American gull or tern, remind yourself that it was saved to the nation by ""the Audubon people."" In times of grave emergency, such as fire, war and scarcity of food, the wild creatures forget their fear of man, and many times actually surrender themselves to his mercy and protection. At such times, hard is the heart and low is the code of manly honor that does not respond in a manner becoming a superior species. The most pathetic wild-animal situation ever seen in the United States on a large scale is that which for six winters in succession forced several thousand starving elk into the settlement of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in quest of food at the hands of their natural enemies. The elk lost all fear, partly because they were not attacked, and they surrounded the log-enclosed haystacks, barns and houses, mutely begging for food. Previous to the winter of 1911, thousands of weak calves and cows perished around the haystacks. Mr. S.N. Leek's wonderful pictures tell a thrilling but very sad story. To the everlasting honor of the people of Jackson Hole, be it recorded that they rose like Men to the occasion that confronted them. In 1909 they gave to the elk herds all the hay that their domestic stock could spare, not pausing to ascertain whether they ever would be reimbursed for it. They just handed it out! The famishing animals literally mobbed the hay-wagons. To-day the national government has the situation in hand. In times of peace and plenty, the people of Jackson Hole take their toll of the elk herds, but their example during starvation periods is to be commended to all men. A SLAUGHTER OF RESTORED GAME.--The case of the chamois in Switzerland teaches the world a valuable lesson in how _not_ to slaughter game that has come back to its haunts through protected breeding. A few years ago, one of the provinces of Switzerland took note of the fact that its once-abundant stock of chamois was almost extinct, and enacted a law by which the remnant was absolutely protected for a long period. During those years of protection, the animals bred and multiplied, until finally the original number was almost restored. Then,--as always in such cases,--there arose a strong demand for an open season; and eventually the government yielded to the pressure of the hunters, and fixed a date whereon an open season should begin. [Illustration: GULLS AND TERNS OF OUR COASTS, SAVED FROM DESTRUCTION These Birds have been Saved and Brought back to us by the Splendid Efforts of the Audubon Societies, and other Bird-Lovers. But for the Anti-Plumage Laws, not one Gull or Tern would now Remain on our Atlantic Coast From the ""American Natural History""] During the period preceding that fatal date, the living chamois, grown half tame by years of immunity from the guns, were all carefully located and marked down by those who intended to hunt them. At daybreak on the fatal day, the onset began. Guns and hunters were everywhere, and the mountains resounded with the fusillade. Hundreds of chamois were slain, by hundreds of hunters; and by the close of that fatal ""open season"" the species was more nearly exterminated throughout that region than ever before. Once more those mountains were nice and barren of game. Let that bloody and disgraceful episode serve as a warning to Americans who are tempted to demand an open season on game that has bred back from the verge of extinction. Particularly do we commend it to the notice of the people of Colorado who _even now_ are demanding an open season on the preserved mountain sheep of that state. The granting of such an open season would be a brutal outrage. Those sheep are now so tame and unsuspicious that the killing of them would be _cold-blooded murder!_ THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION.--Within reasonable limits, any partly-destroyed wild species can be increased and brought back by giving absolute protection from harassment and slaughter. When a species is struggling to recuperate, it deserves to be left _entirely unmolested_ until it is once more on safe ground. Every breeding wild animal craves seclusion and entire immunity from excitement and all forms of molestation. Nature simply demands this as her unassailable right. It is my firm belief that any wild species will breed in captivity whenever its members are given a degree of seclusion that they deem satisfactory. With species that have not been shot down to a point entirely too low, adequate protection generously long in duration will bring back their numbers. If the people of the United States so willed it, we could have wild white-tailed deer in every state and in every county (save city counties) between the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains. We could easily have one thousand bob white quail for every one now living. We could have squirrels in every grove, and songbirds by the million,--merely by protecting them from slaughter and molestation. From Ohio to the great plains, the pinnated grouse could be made far more common than crows and blackbirds. Inasmuch as all this is true,--and no one with information will dispute it for a moment,--is it not folly to seek to supplant our own splendid native species of game birds (_that we never yet have decently protected!_) with foreign species? Let the American people answer this question with ""Yes"" or ""No."" The methods by which our non-game birds can be encouraged and brought back are very simple: Protect them, put up shelters for them, give them nest-boxes in abundance, protect them from cats, dogs, and all other forms of destruction, and feed those that need to be fed. I should think that every boy living in the country would find keen pleasure in making and erecting nest-boxes for martins, wrens, and squirrels; in putting up straw teepees in winter for the quail, in feeding the quail, and in nailing to the trees chunks of suet and fat pork every winter for the woodpeckers, nuthatches, and other winter residents. Will any person now on this earth live long enough to see the present all-pervading and devilish spirit of slaughter so replaced by the love of wild creatures and the true spirit of conservation that it will be as rare as it now is common? But let no one think for a moment that any vanishing species can at any time be brought back; for that would be a grave error. The point is always reached, by every such species, that the survivors are too few to cope with circumstances, and recovery is impossible. The heath hen could not be brought back, neither could the passenger pigeon. The whooping crane, the sage grouse, the trumpeter swan, the wild turkey, and the upland plover never will come back to us, and nothing that we can do ever will bring them back. Circumstances are against those species,--and I fear against many others also. Thanks to the fact that the American bison breeds well in captivity, we have saved that species from complete extinction, but our antelope seems to be doomed. It is because of the alarming condition of our best wild life that quick action and strong action is vitally necessary. We are sleeping on our possibilities. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXIV INTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL Man has made numerous experiments in the transplantation of wild species of mammals and birds from one country, or continent, to another. About one-half these efforts have been beneficial, and the other half have resulted disastrously. The transplantation of any wild-animal species is a leap in the dark. On general principles it is dangerous to meddle with the laws of Nature, and attempt to improve upon the code of the wilderness. Our best wisdom in such matters may easily prove to be short-sighted folly. The trouble lies in the fact that concerning transplantation it is _impossible for us to know beforehand all the conditions that will affect it, or that it will effect, and how it will work out_. In its own home a species may _seem_ not only harmless, but actually beneficial to man. We do not know, and _we can not know_, all the influences that keep it in check, and that mould its character. We do not know, and we can not know without a trial, how new environment will affect it, and what new traits of character it will develop under radically different conditions. The gentle dove of Europe may become the tyrant dove of Cathay. The Repressed Rabbit of the Old World becomes in Australia the Uncontrollable Rabbit, a devastator and a pest of pests. No wild species should be transplanted and set free in a wild state to stock new regions without consulting men of wisdom, and following their advice. It is now against the laws of the United States to introduce and acclimatize in a wild state, anywhere in the United States, any wild-bird species without the approval of the Department of Agriculture. The law is a wise one. Furthermore, the same principle should apply to birds that it is proposed to transplant from one portion of the United States into another, especially when the two are widely separated. On this point, I once learned a valuable lesson, which may well point my present moral. Incidentally, also, it was a narrow escape for me! A gentlemen of my acquaintance, who admires the European magpie, and is well aware of its acceptable residence in various countries in Europe, once requested my cooperation in securing and acclimatizing at his country estate a number of birds of that species. As in duty bound, I laid the matter before our Department of Agriculture, and asked for an opinion. The Department replied, in effect, ""Why import a foreign magpie when we have in the West a species of our own quite as handsome, and which could more easily be transplanted?"" The point seemed well taken. Now, I had seen much of the American magpie in its wild home,--the Rocky Mountains, and the western border of the Great Plains,--and I _thought_ I was acquainted with it. I knew that a few complaints against it had been made, but they had seemed to me very trivial. To me our magpie seemed to have a generally unobjectionable record. Fortunately for me, I wrote to Mr. Hershey, Assistant Curator of Ornithology in the Colorado State Museum, for assistance in procuring fifty birds, for transplantation to the State of New York. Mr. Hershey replied that if I really wished the birds for acclimatization, he would gladly procure them for me; but he said that in the _thickly-settled farming communities_ of Colorado, the magpie is now regarded as a pest. It devours the eggs and nestlings of other wild birds, and not only that, it destroys so many eggs of domestic poultry that many farmers are compelled to keep their egg-laying hens shut up in wire enclosures! Now, this condition happened to be entirely unknown to me, because I never had seen the American magpie in action _in a farming community_! Of course the proposed experiment was promptly abandoned, but it is embarrassing to think how near I came to making a mistake. Even if the magpies had been transplanted and had become a nuisance in this state, they could easily have been exterminated by shooting; but the memory of the error would have been humiliating to the party of the first part. THE OLD WORLD PHEASANTS IN AMERICA.--In 1881 the first Chinese ring-necked pheasants were introduced into the United States, twelve miles below Portland, Oregon; twelve males and three females. The next year, Oregon gave pheasants a five-year close season. A little later, the golden and silver pheasants of China were introduced, and all three species throve mightily, on the Pacific Coast, in Oregon, Washington and western British Columbia. In 1900, the sportsmen of Portland and Vancouver were shooting cock golden pheasants according to law. The success of Chinese and Japanese pheasants on the Pacific Coast soon led to experiments in the more progressive states, at state expense. State pheasant hatcheries have been established in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa and California. In many localities, the old-world pheasants have come to stay. The rise and progress of the ring-neck in western New York has already been noted. It came about merely through protection. That protection was protection in fact, not the false ""protection"" that shoots on the sly. It is the irony of fate that full protection should be accorded a foreign bird, in order that it may multiply and possess the land, while the same kind of protection is refused the native bob white, and it is now almost a dead species, so far as this state is concerned. In looking about for grievances against the ring-necked and English pheasant, some persons have claimed that in winter these birds are ""budders,"" which means that they harmfully strip trees and bushes of the buds that those bushes will surely need in their spring opening. On that point Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, sent out a circular letter of inquiry, in response to which he received many statements. With but one exception, all the testimony received was to the effect that pheasants are _not_ bud-eaters, and that generally the charge is unfounded. The introduction of old-world pheasants, and the attempted introduction of the Hungarian partridge, are efforts designed first of all to furnish sportsmen something to shoot, and incidentally to provide a new food supply for the table. The people of this country are not starving, nor are they even very hungry for the meat of strange birds; but as a food-producer, the pheasant is all right. It disgusts me to the core, however, to see states that wantonly and wickedly, through sheer apathy and lack of business enterprise, have allowed the quail, the heath hen, the pinnated grouse and the ruffed grouse to become almost exterminated by extravagant and foolish shooters, now putting forth wonderfully diligent efforts and spending money without end, in introducing _foreign_ species! Many men actually take the ground that our game ""can't live"" in its own country any longer; but only the ignorant and the unthinking will say so! Give our game birds decent, sensible, _actual_ protection, stop their being slaughtered far faster than they breed, and _they will live anywhere in their own native haunts_! But where is there _one species_ of upland game bird in America that has been sensibly and adequately protected? From Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon there is _not one,--not a single locality in which protection from shooting has been sensible, or just, or adequate_. We have universally given our American upland game birds an unfair deal, and now we are adding insult to slaughter by bringing in foreign game birds to replace them--because our birds ""can't live"" before five million shot-guns! Our American game birds CAN live, anywhere in the haunts where nature placed them that are not to-day actually occupied by cities and towns! Give me the making of the laws, and I will make the prairie chicken and quail as numerous throughout the northern states east of the Great Plains as domestic chickens are outside the regular poultry farms. There is only one reason why there are not ten million quail in the state of New York to-day,--one for each human inhabitant,--and that reason is the infernal greed and selfishness of the men who have almost exterminated our quail by over-shooting. Don't talk to me about the ""hard winters"" killing off our quail! It is the hard cheek of the men who shoot them when they ought to let them alone. The State of Iowa could support 500,000 prairie chickens and never miss the waste grain that they would glean in the fields; but now the prairie chicken is practically extinct in Iowa, only a few scattered specimens remaining as ""last survivors"" in some of the northern counties. The migration of those birds that unexpectedly came down from the north last winter was like the fall of a meteor,--only the birds promptly faded away again. Why should New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts exterminate the heath hen and coddle the ring-necked pheasant and the Hungarian partridge? The introduction of the old-world pheasants interests me very little. Every one that I see is a painful reminder of our slaughtered quail and grouse,--the birds that never have had a square deal from the American people! Thus far the introduction of the Hungarian partridge has not been successful, anywhere. Connecticut, Missouri, New Jersey and I think other states have tried this, and failed. The failure of that species brings no sorrow to me. I prefer our own game birds; and if the American people will not conserve those properly and decently they deserve to have no game birds. THE EUROPEAN RED DEER IN NEW ZEALAND.--Occasionally a gameless land makes a ten-strike by introducing a foreign game animal that does no harm, and becomes of great value. The greatest success ever made in the transplantation of game animals has been in New Zealand. Originally, New Zealand possessed no large animals, and no ""big-game."" When Nature passed around the deer, antelopes, sheep, goats, wild cattle and bears, New Zealand failed to receive her share. For centuries her splendid forests, her grand mountains and picturesque valleys remained untenanted by big game. In 1864, the Prince Consort of England caused seven head of European red deer to be taken from the royal park at Windsor, and sent to Christchurch, New Zealand. Only three of the animals survived the long voyage; a buck and two does. For several weeks the two were kept in a barn in Christchurch, where they served no good purpose, and were not likely to live long or be happy. Finally some one said, ""Let's set them free in the mountains!"" The idea was adopted. The three animals were hauled an uncertain number of miles into the interior mountains and set free. They promptly settled down in their new home. They began to breed, and now on the North Island there are probably five thousand European red deer, every one of which has descended directly from the famous three! And here is the strangest part of the story: The red deer of the North Island represent the greatest case of in-and-in breeding of wild animals on record. According to the experience of the world in the breeding of domestic cattle (_not horses_), we should expect physical deterioration, the development of diseases, and disaster. On the contrary, the usual evil results of in-breeding in domestic cattle have been totally absent. _The red deer of New Zealand are to-day physically larger and more robust animals, with longer and heavier antlers, and longer hair, than any of the red deer of Europe west of Germany_! Red deer have been introduced practically all over New Zealand, and the total number now in the Islands must be somewhere near forty thousand. The sportsmen of that country have grand sport, and take many splendid trophies. That transplantation has been a very great success. Incidentally, the case of the in-bred deer of the North Island, taken along with other cases of which we know, establishes a new and important principle in evolution. It is this: _When healthy wild animals are established in a state of nature, either absolutely free, or confined in preserves so large that they roam at will, seek the food of nature and take care of themselves, in-and-in breeding produces no ill effects, and ceases to be a factor. The animals develop in physical perfection according to the climate and their food supply; and the introduction of new blood is not necessary_. THE FALLOW DEER ON THE ISLAND OF LAMBAY.--In the Irish Sea, a few miles from the southeast coast of Ireland, is the Island of Lambay, owned by Cecil Baring, Esq. The island is precisely one square mile in area, and some of its sea frontage terminates in perpendicular cliffs. In many ways the island is of unusual interest to zoologists, and its fauna has been well set forth by Mr. Baring. In the year 1892 three fallow deer (_Dama vulgaris_) a buck and two does, were transplanted from a park on the Irish mainland to Lambay, and there set free. From that slender stock has sprung a large herd, which, but for the many deer that have been purposely shot, and the really considerable number that have been killed by going over the cliffs in stormy weather, the progeny of the original three would to-day number several hundred head. No new blood has been introduced, and _no deer have died of disease_. Even counting out the losses by the rifle and by accidental death, the herd to-day numbers more than one hundred head. Mr. Baring declares that neither he nor his gamekeeper have ever been able to discover any deterioration in the deer of Lambay, either in size, weight, size of antlers, fertility or general physical stamina. The deterioration through disease, especially tuberculosis, that always is dreaded and often observed in closely in-bred domestic cattle, has been totally absent. In looking about for wild species that have been transplanted, and that have thriven and become beneficial to man, there seems to be mighty little game in sight! The vast majority belong in the next chapter. We will venture to mention the bob white quail that were introduced into Utah in 1871, into Idaho in 1875, and the California valley quail in Washington in 1857. Wherever these efforts have succeeded, the results have been beneficial to man. In 1879 a well-organized effort was made to introduce European quail into several of the New England and Middle States,--to take the place of the bob white, we may suppose,--the bird that ""can't stand the winters!"" About three thousand birds were distributed and set free,--and went down and out, just as might have been expected. During the past twenty years it is safe to say that not less than $500,000 have been expended in the northern states, and particularly in the northeastern states, in importing live quail from Kansas, the Indian Territory, Oklahoma, Texas, the Carolinas and other southern states, for restocking areas from which the northern bob white had been exterminated by foolish over-shooting! I think that fully nine-tenths of these efforts have ended in total failure. The quail could not survive in their strange environment. I cannot recall a _single instance_ in which restocking northern covers with southern quail has been a success. There is no royal road to the restoration of an exterminated bird species. Where the native seed still exists, by long labor and travail, thorough protection and a mighty long close season, it can be encouraged to _breed back and return_; but it is an evolution that can not be hurried in the least. Protect Nature, and leave the rest to her. With mammals, the case is different. It is possible to restock depleted areas, provided Time is recognized as a dominant factor. I can cite two interesting cases by way of illustration, but this subject will form another chapter. In the transplantation of fishes, conditions are widely different, and many notable successes have been achieved. One of the greatest hits ever made by the United States Bureau of Fisheries in the planting of fish in new localities was the introduction of the striped bass or rock-fish (_Roccus lineatus_) of our Atlantic coast, into the coast waters of California. In 1879, 135 live fish were deposited in Karquines Strait, at Martinez, and in 1882, 300 more were planted in Suisun Bay, near the first locality chosen. Twelve years after the first planting in San Francisco Bay, the markets of San Francisco handled 149,997 pounds of striped bass. At that time the average weight for a whole year was eleven pounds, and the average price was ten cents per pound. Fish weighing as high as forty-nine pounds have been taken, and there are reasons for the belief that eventually the fish of California will attain as great weight as those of the Atlantic and the Gulf. The San Francisco markets now sell, annually, about one and one half million pounds of striped bass. This fish has taken its place among anglers as one of the game fishes of the California coast, and affords fine sport. Strange to say, however, it has not yet spread beyond the shores of California. Regarding this species, the records of the United States Bureau of Fisheries are of interest. In 1897, the California markets handled 2,949,642 pounds, worth $225,527.--(American Natural History.) Nowhere else in the world, we venture to say, were such extensive, costly and persistent efforts put forth in the transplantation of any wild foreign species as the old U.S. Fish Commission, under Prof. Spencer F. Baird, put forth in the introduction of the German carp into the fresh water ponds, lakes and rivers of the United States. It was held that because the carp could live and thrive in waters bottomed with mud, that species would be a boon to all inland regions where bodies of water, or streams, were scarce and dear. Although the carp is not the best fish in the world for the table, it seemed that the dwellers in the prairie and great plains regions would find it far better than bullheads, or no fish at all,--which are about the same thing. By means of special fish cars, sent literally all over the United States, at a great total expense, live carp, hatched in the ponds near the Washington Monument were distributed to all applicants. The German carp spread far and wide; but to-day I think the fish has about as many enemies as friends. In some places, strong objections have been filed to the manner in which carp stir up the mud at the bottom of ponds and small lakes, greatly to the detriment of all the native fishes found therein. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXV INTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BECOME PESTS The man who successfully transplants or ""introduces"" into a new habitat any persistent species of living thing, assumes a very grave responsibility. Every introduced species is doubtful gravel until panned out. The enormous losses that have been inflicted upon the world through the perpetuation of follies with wild vertebrates and insects would, if added together, be enough to purchase a principality. The most aggravating feature of these follies in transplantation is that never yet have they been made severely punishable. We are just as careless and easy-going on this point as we were about the government of the Yellowstone Park in the days when Howell and other poachers destroyed our first national bison herd, and when caught red-handed--as Howell was, skinning seven Park bison cows,--_could not be punished for it, because there was no penalty prescribed by any law_. To-day, there is a way in which any revengeful person could inflict enormous damage on the entire South, at no cost to himself, involve those states in enormous losses and the expenditure of vast sums of money, yet go absolutely unpunished! THE GYPSY MOTH is a case in point. This winged calamity was imported at Maiden, Massachusetts, near Boston, by a French entomologist, Mr. Leopold Trouvelot, in 1868 or '69. History records the fact that the man of science did not purposely set free the pest. He was endeavoring with live specimens to find a moth that would produce a cocoon of commercial value to America; and a sudden gust of wind blew out of his study, through an open window, his living and breeding specimens of the gypsy moth. The moth itself is not bad to look at, but its larvae is a great, overgrown brute, with an appetite like a hog. Immediately Mr. Trouvelot sought to recover his specimens, and when he failed to find them all. like a man of real honor, he notified the State authorities of the accident. Every effort was made to recover all the specimens, but enough escaped to produce progeny that soon became a scourge to the trees of Massachusetts. The method of the big, nasty-looking mottled-brown caterpillar was very simple. It devoured the entire foliage of every tree that grew in its sphere of influence. The gypsy moth spread with alarming rapidity and persistence. In course of time the state authorities of Massachuestts were forced to begin a relentless war upon it, by poisonous sprays and by fire. It was awful! Up to this date (1912) the New England states and the United States Government service have expended in fighting this pest about $7,680,000! The spread of this pest has been retarded, but the gypsy moth never will be wholly stamped out. To-day it exists in Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire, and it is due to reach New York at an early date. It is steadily spreading in three directions from Boston, its original point of departure, and when it strikes the State of New York, we, too, will begin to pay dearly for the Trouvclot experiment. It is said that General S.C. Lawrence, of Medford, Massachusetts, has spent $75,000 in trying to protect his trees from the ravages of this scourge. THE RABBIT PLAGUE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND.--The rabbit curse upon Australia and New Zealand is so well known as to require little comment. In this case the introduction was deliberate. In the days when the sheep industry was most prosperous, a patriotic gentleman conceived the idea that the introduction of the rabbit, and its establishment as a wild animal, would be a good thing. He reasoned that it would furnish a good food supply, that it would furnish sport, and being unable to harm any other creature of flesh and blood it was therefore harmless. Accordingly, three pairs of rabbits were imported and set free. In a short time, the immense number of rabbits that began to overrun the country furnished food for reflection, as well as for the table. A very simple calculation brought out the startling information that, under perfectly favorable conditions, a single pair of rabbits could in three years' time produce progeny amounting to 13,718,000 individuals. Ever since that time, in discussing the rabbits of Australia it has been necessary to speak in millions. ""The inhabitants of the colony,"" says Dr. Richard Lydekker, ""soon found that the rabbits were a plague, for they devoured the grass, which was needed for the sheep, the bark of trees, and every kind of fruit and vegetable, until the prospects of the colony became a very serious matter, and ruin seemed inevitable. In New South Wales upwards of 15,000,000 rabbits skins have been exported in a single year; while in thirteen years ending with 1889 no less than 39,000,000 were accounted for in Victoria alone. ""To prevent the increase of these rodents, the introduction of weasels, stoats, mongooses, etc., has been tried; but it has been found that those carnivores neglected the rabbits and took to feeding on poultry, and thus became as great a nuisance as the animals they were intended to destroy. The attempt to kill them off by the introduction of an epidemic disease has also failed. In order to protect such portions of the country as are still free from rabbits, fences of wire netting have been erected; one of these fences erected by the Government of Victoria extending for a distance of upwards of one hundred and fifty geographical miles. In New Zealand, where the rabbit has been introduced little more than twenty years, its increase has been so enormous, and the destruction it inflicts so great, that in some districts it has actually been a question whether the colonists should not vacate the country rather than attempt to fight against the plague. The average number of rabbit skins exported from New Zealand is now twelve millions.""--(Royal Natural History.) THE FOX PEST IN AUSTRALIA.--And now unfortunate Australia has a new pest, also acquired by importation of an alien species. It is the European fox (_Vulpes vulpes_). The only redeeming feature about this fresh calamity is found in the fact that the species was not deliberately introduced into Australia for the benefit of the local fauna. Mr. O.W. Rosenhain, of Melbourne, informs me (1912) that about thirty years ago the Hunt Club brought to Australia about twenty foxes, for the promotion of the noble sport of fox hunting. In some untoward manner, the most of those animals escaped. They survived, multiplied, and have provided New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with a fox pest of the first rank. The destruction of wild bird life and poultry has become so serious that Australia now is making vigorous efforts to exterminate the pest. The government pays ten shillings bounty on fox scalps, besides which each prime fox skin is worth from four to five dollars. It is hoped that these combined values will eliminate the fox pest. Regarding foxes in Australia, Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef has this to say in his extremely interesting and valuable book, ""Wild Life in Australia,"" page 146: ""We found that foxes were unfortunately plentiful in this district, and in a hollow log that served to shelter some cubs were noticed the remains of ducks, fowls, rabbits, lambs, bandicoots and snakes; so they evidently vary their fare, snakes even not coming amiss. They also sneak on wild ducks that are nesting by the edge of the water among the rushes and tussocky grass, and catch quail also, especially sitting birds. _These animals are, and always will be, a great source of trouble in the thickly timbered country and stony ranges, and will gradually, like the rabbit, extend all over Australia_. They are evidently not contented with ground game only, as Mr. A.F. Kelly, of Barwonleigh, in Victoria, states: ""When riding past a bull-oak tree about twenty-five feet high, with either a magpie's or crow's nest on top. I noticed the nest looked very bulky, and had something red in it. On going nearer I saw a large fox coiled up in it!"" THE MONGOOSE.--Circumstances alter cases, and a change of environment sometimes works marvelous changes in the character of an animal species. Now, _why_ should not the gray Indian mongoose (formerly called the ichneumon, _(Herpestes griscus_)) destroy poultry in India, as it does elsewhere? There is poultry in plenty to be destroyed, but ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"" elects to specialize on the killing of rats, and cobras, and other snakes. In his own sphere of influence,--India and the orient,--the mongoose is a fairly decent citizen, and he fits into the time-worn economy of that region. As a destroyer of the thrice-anathema domestic rat, he has no equal in the domain of flesh and blood. His temper is so fierce that one ""pet"" mongoose has been known to kill a full grown male giant bustard, and put a greyhound to flight. In an evil moment (1872) Mr. W.B. Espeut conceived the idea that it would be a good thing to introduce mongooses to the rats of Barbadoes and Jamaica that were pestering the cane-fields to an annoying extent. It was done. The mongooses attacked the rats, cleaned them out, multiplied, and then looked about for more worlds to conquer. Snakes and lizards were few; but they cheerfully killed and devoured all there were. Then, being continuously hungry, they attacked the wild birds and poultry, indiscriminately, and with their usual vigor. I have been told that in Barbadoes ""they cleaned out every living thing that they could catch and kill, and then they attacked the sugar-cane."" The last count in the indictment may seem hard to believe; but it is a fact that the Indian mongoose often resorts to fruit and vegetable food. In Jamaica, at the end of the rat-killing period, the planters joyfully estimated that the labors of Herpestes had saved between 500,000 pounds and 750,000 pounds to the industries of that island. That was before the slaughter of wild birds and poultry began. I am told that up to date the damage done by the mongoose far exceeds the value of the benefit it once conferred, but the total has not been computed. Up to this date, the mongoose has invaded and become a destructive pest in Barbadoes, Jamaica, Cuba, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Nevis, Fiji and all the larger islands of the Hawaiian group. It would require many pages to contain a full account of each introduction, awakening, reckoning of damages and payment of bounties for destruction that the fiendish mongoose has wrought out wherever it has been introduced. The progress of the pest is everywhere the same,--sweeping destruction of rats, snakes, wild birds, small mammals, and finally poultry and vegetables. Every country that now is without the mongoose will do well to shut and guard diligently all the doors by which it might be introduced. Throughout its range in the western hemisphere, the mongoose is a pest; and the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has done well in securing the enactment of a law peremptorily prohibiting the importation of any animals of that species into the United States or any of its colonies. The fierce temper, indomitable courage and vaulting appetite of the mongoose would make its actual introduction in any of the warm portions of the United States a horrible calamity. In the southern states, and all along the Pacific slope clear up to Seattle, it could live, thrive and multiply; and the slaughter that it could and would inflict upon our wild birds generally, especially all those that nest and live on the ground, saying nothing of the slaughter of poultry, would drive the American people crazy. Fancy an animal with the murderous ferocity of a mink, the agility of a squirrel, the penetration of a ferret and the cunning of a rat, infesting the thickets and barnyards of this country. The mongoose can live wherever a rat can live, provided it can get a fair amount of animal food. Not for $1,000,000 could any one of the southern or Pacific states afford to have a pair of these little gray fiends imported and set free. If such a calamity ever occurs, all wheels should stop, and every habitant should turn out and hunt for the animals until they are found and pulverized. No matter if it should require a thousand men and $100,000, _find them!_ If not found, the cost to the state will soon be a million a year, with no ending. In spite of the vigilance of our custom house officers, every now and then a Hindoo from some foreign vessel sneaks into the country with a pet mongoose (and they do make great pets!) inside his shirt, or in the bottom of a bag of clothing. Of course, whenever the Department of Agriculture discovers any of these surreptitious animals, they are at once confiscated, and either killed or sent to a public zoological park for safe-keeping. In New York, the director of the Zoological Park is so genuinely concerned about the possibility of the escape of a female mongoose that he has issued two standing orders: All live mongooses offered to us shall at once be purchased, and every female animal shall immediately be chloroformed. If _Herpestes griseus_ ever breaks loose in the United States, the crime shall not justly be chargeable to us. THE ENGLISH SPARROW.--In the United States, the English sparrow is a national sorrow, almost too great to be endured. It is a bird of plain plumage, low tastes, impudent disposition and persistent fertility. Continually does it crowd out its betters, or pugnaciously drive them away, and except on very rare occasions it eats neither insects nor weed seeds. It has no song, and in habits it is a bird of the street and the gutter. There is not one good reason why it should exist in this country. If it were out of the way, our native insect-eaters of song and beauty could return to our lawns and orchards. The English sparrow is a nuisance and a pest, and if it could be returned to the land of its nativity we would gain much. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXVI NATIONAL AND STATE GAME PRESERVES, AND BIRD REFUGES Out West, there is said to be a ""feeling"" that game and forest conservation has ""gone far enough."" In Montana, particularly, the National Wool-Growers' Association has for some time been firmly convinced that ""the time has come to call a halt."" Oh, yes! A halt on the conservation of game and forests; but not on the free grazing of sheep on the public domain. No, not even while those same sheep are busily growing wool that is so fearfully and wonderfully conserved by a sky-high tariff that the truly poor Americans are forced to wear garments made of shoddy because they cannot afford to buy clothing made of wool! (This is the testimony of a responsible clothing merchant, in 1912.) We can readily understand the new hue and cry against conservation that the sheep men now are raising. Of course they are against all new game and forest reserves,--unless the woolly hordes are given the right to graze in them! Many men of the Great West,--the West beyond the Great Plains,--are afflicted with a desire to do as they please with the natural resources of that region. That is the great curse that to-day rests upon our game. When the nearest game warden is 50 miles away, and big game is only 5 miles away, it is time for that game to take to the tall timber. But in the West, and East and South, there are many men and women who believe in reasonable conservation, and deplore destruction. We have not by any means reached the point where we can think of stopping in the making of game preserves, or forest preserves. Of the former, we have scarcely begun to make. The majority of the states of our Union know of _state_ game preserves only by hearsay. But the time is coming when the states will come forward, and perform the serious duty that they neglect to-day. Let the statesmen of America be not afraid of making too many game preserves! For the next year, one per day would be none too many! Remember, that on one hand we have the Army of Destruction, and on the other the expectant millions of Posterity. No executor or trustee ever erred in safeguarding an estate too carefully. Fifty years hence, if your successors and mine find that too much land has been set aside for the good of the people, they can mighty easily restore any surplus to the public domain, and at a vastly increased valuation. Give Posterity at least _one_ chance to debate the question: ""Were our forefathers too liberal in the making of game and forest reserves?"" We can always carve up any useless surplus of the public domain, and restore it to commercial uses; but none of the men of to-day will live long enough to see so strange a proceeding carried into effect. The game preserves of the United States government are so small (with the exception of the Yellowstone and Glacier Parks), that very few people ever hear of them, and fewer still know of them in detail. It seems to be quite time that they should be set forth categorically; and it is most earnestly to be hoped that this list soon will be doubled. THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.--This was the first of the national parks and game preserves of the United States. Some of our game preserves are not exactly national parks, but this is both, by Act of Congress. It is 62 miles long from north to south, 54 miles wide and contains a total area of 3,348 square miles, or 2,142,720 acres. Its western border lies in Idaho, and along its northern border a narrow strip lies in Montana. It is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, and it is guarded by a detachment of cavalry from the United States Army. The Superintendent is now a commissioned officer of the United States Army. The business of protecting the game is performed partly by four scouts, who are civilians specially engaged for that purpose, but the number has always been totally inadequate to the work to be performed. At least one-half of the public interest attaching to the Yellowstone Park is based upon its wild animals. There, the average visitor sees, for the first time, wild mountain sheep, antelope, mule deer, elk, grizzly bears and white pelicans, roaming free. But for the tragedy of the Park bison herd,--slaughtered by poachers from 1890 to 1893, from 300 head down to 30--visitors would see wild bison also; but now the few wild bison remaining keep as far as possible from the routes of tourist travel. The bison were slaughtered through an inadequate protective force, and (then) utterly inadequate laws. Lieut.-Col. L.M. Brett, U.S.A., Superintendent of the Yellowstone Park advises me (July 29, 1912) that the wild big game in the Yellowstone Park in the summer of 1912, is as shown below, based on actual counts and estimates of the Park scouts, and particularly Scout McBride. ""The estimates of buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, sheep and bear are based on actual counts, or very close observations, and are pretty nearly correct."" (Col. Brett). Wild Buffalo 49 Moose 550 Elk (in summer) 35,000 Antelope 500 Mountain Sheep 210 Mule Deer 400 White-tailed Deer 100 Grizzly Bears 50 Black Bears 100 Pumas 100 Gray Wolves none Coyotes 400 Pelicans 1,000 The actual count of 49 wild bison in the Park, 10 of which are calves of 1912, will be to all friends of the bison a delightful surprise. Heretofore the little band had seemed to be stationary, which if true would soon mean a decline. The history of the wild game of the Yellowstone Park is blackened by two occurrences, and one existing fact. The fact is: the town of Gardiner is situated on the northern boundary of the Park, in the State of Montana. In Gardiner there are a number of men, armed with rifles, who toward game have the gray-wolf quality of mercy. The first stain is the massacre of the 270 wild bison for their heads and robes, already noted. The second blot is the equally savage slaughter in the early winter of 1911, by some of the people of Gardiner, reinforced by so-called sportsmen from other parts of the state, of all the park elk they could kill,--bulls, cows and calves,--because a large band wandered across the line into the shambles of Gardiner, on Buffalo Flats. If the people of Gardiner can not refrain from slaughtering the game of the Park--the very animals annually seen by 20,000 visitors to the Park,--then it is time for the American people to summon the town of Gardiner before the bar of public opinion, to show cause why the town should not be wiped off the map. The 35,000 elk that summer in the Park are compelled in winter to migrate to lower altitudes in order to find grass that is not under two feet of snow. In the winter of 1911-12, possibly 5,000 went south, into Jackson Hole, and 3,000 went northward into Montana. The sheep-grazing north of the Park, and the general settlement by ranchmen of Jackson Hole, have deprived the elk herds of those regions of their natural food. For several years past, up to and including the winter of 1910-11, some thousands of weak and immature elk have perished in the Jackson Hole country, from starvation and exposure. The ranchmen of that region have had terrible times,--in witnessing the sufferings of thousands of elk tamed by hunger, and begging in piteous dumb show for the small and all-too-few haystacks of the ranchmen. The people of Jackson Hole, headed by S.N. Leek, the famous photographer and lecturer on those elk herds, have done all that they could do in the premises. The spirit manifested by them has been the exact reverse of that manifested in Gardiner. To their everlasting credit, they have kept domestic sheep out of the Jackson Valley,--by giving the owners of invading herds ""hours"" in which to get their sheep ""all out, and over the western range."" In 1909, the State of Wyoming spent in feeding starving elk $5,000 In 1911, the State of Wyoming spent in feeding starving elk 5,000 In 1911, the U.S. Government appropriated for feeding starving elk, and exporting elk $20,000 In 1912, the Camp-Fire Club of Detroit gave, for feeding hungry elk 100 In 1910-11, about 3,000 elk perished in Jackson Hole In 1911-12, Mr. Leek's photographs of the elk herds showed an alarming absence of mature bulls, indicating that now the most of the breeding is done by immature males. This means the sure deterioration of the species. The prompt manner in which Congress responded in the late winter of 1911 to a distress call in behalf of the starving elk, is beyond all ordinary terms of praise. It was magnificent. In fear and trembling, Congress was asked, through Senator Lodge, to appropriate $5,000. Congress and Senator Lodge made it $20,000; and for the first time the legislature of Wyoming appealed for national aid to save the joint-stock herds of Wyoming and the Yellowstone Park. GLACIER PARK, MONTANA.--In the wild and picturesque mountains of northwestern Montana, covering both sides of the great Continental Divide, there is a region that has been splendidly furnished by the hand of Nature. It is a bewildering maze of thundering peaks, plunging valleys, evergreen forests, glistening glaciers, mirror lakes and roaring mountain streams. Its leading citizens are white mountain goats, mountain sheep, moose, mule deer and white-tailed deer, and among those present are black and grizzly bears galore. Commercially, the 1,400 square miles of Glacier Park, even with its 60 glaciers and 260 lakes, are worth exactly the price of its big trees, and not a penny more. For mining, agriculture, horticulture and stock-raising, it is a cipher. As a transcendant pleasure ground and recreation wilderness for ninety millions of people, it is worth ninety millions of dollars, and not a penny less. It is a pleasure park of which the greatest of the nations of the earth,--whichever that may be,--might well be overbearingly proud; and its accessibility is almost unbelievable until seen. This park is bounded on the south by the Great Northern Railway, on the east by the Blackfoot Indian Reservation, on the north by Alberta and British Columbia, and on the west by West Fork of the Flathead River. Horizontally, it contains 1,400 square miles; but as the goat climbs, its area is at least double that. Its valleys are filled and its lakes are encircled by grand forests of Douglas fir, hemlock, spruce, white pine, cedar and larch; and if ever they are destroyed by fire, it will be a national calamity, a century long. _So long as the American people keep out of the poorhouse, let there be no lumber-cutting vandalism in that park, destroying the beauty of every acre of forest that is touched by axe or saw. The greatest beauty of those forests is the forest floor, which lumbering operations would utterly destroy_. Never mind if there is ""ripe timber"" there! The American nation is not suffering for the dollars that those lovely forest giants would fetch by board measure. What if a tree does fall now and then from old age! We can stand the expense. If Posterity a hundred years hence finds itself lumberless, and wishes to use those trees, then let Posterity pay the price, and take them. We are not suffering for them; and our duty is to save them inviolate, and hand them down as a heritage that we proudly transmit unimpaired. [Illustration: UNITED STATES NATIONAL GAME PRESERVES and Five Pacific Bird Refuges] The friends of wild life are particularly interested in Glacier Park as a national game reservoir, and refuge for wild life. On the north, in Alberta, it is soon to be extended by Waterton Lakes Park. When I visited Glacier Park, in 1909, with Frederick H. Kennard and Charles H. Conrad, I procured from three intelligent guides their best estimates of the amount of big game then in the Park. The guides were Thomas H. Scott, Josiah Rogers and Walter S. Gibb.[L] [Footnote L: See _Recreation_ Magazine, May, 1910, p. 213] They compared notes, and finally agreed upon these figures: Elk 200 Moose 2,500 Mountain Sheep 700 Mountain Goats 10,500 Grizzly Bears 1,000 to 1,500 Black Bears 2,500 to 3,000 As previously stated, one of the surprising features of this new wonder land is its accessibility. The Great Northern lands you at Belton. A ride of three miles over a good road through a beautiful forest brings you to the foot of Lake McDonald, and in one hour more by boat you are at the hotels at the head of the lake. At that point you are within three hours' horse-back ride of Sperry Glacier and the marvelous panorama that unrolls before you from the top of Lincoln Peak. At the foot of that Peak we saw a big, wild white mountain goat: and another one watched us climb up to the Sperry Glacier. MT. OLYMPUS NATIONAL MONUMENT.--For at least six years the advocates of the preservation of American wild life and forests vainly desired that the grand mountain territory around Mount Olympus, in northwestern Washington, should be established as a national forest and game preserve. In addition to the preservation of the forests, it was greatly desired that the remnant bands of Olympic wapiti (described as _Cervus roosevelti_) should be perpetuated. It now contains 1,975 specimens of that variety. In Congress, two determined efforts were made in behalf of the region referred to, but both were defeated by the enemies of forests and wild life. In an auspicious moment, Dr. T.S. Palmer, Assistant Chief of the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, thought of a law under which it would be both proper and right to bring the desired preserve into existence. The law referred to expressly clothes the President of the United States with power to preserve any monumental feature of nature which it clearly is the duty of the state to preserve for all time from the hands of the spoilers. With the enthusiastic approval and assistance of Representative William E. Humphrey, of Seattle, Dr. Palmer set in motion the machinery necessary to the carrying of the matter before the President in proper form, and kept it going, with the result that on March 2, 1909, President Roosevelt affixed his signature to the document that closed the circuit. Thus was created the Mount Olympus National Monument, preserving forever 608,640 acres of magnificent mountains, valleys, glaciers, streams and forests, and all the wild creatures living therein and thereon. The people of the state of Washington have good reason to rejoice in the fact that their most highly-prized scenic wonderland, and the last survivors of the wapiti in that state, are now preserved for all coming time. At the same time, we congratulate Dr. Palmer on the brilliant success of his initiative. THE SUPERIOR NATIONAL GAME AND FOREST PRESERVE.--The people of Minnesota long desired that a certain great tract of wilderness in the extreme northern portion of that state, now well stocked with moose and deer, should be established as a game and forest preserve. Unfortunately, however, the national government could go no farther than to withdraw the lands (and waters) from entry, and declare it a forest reserve. At the right moment, some bright genius proposed that the national government should by executive order create a ""_forest_ reserve,"" and then that the legislature of Minnesota should pass an act providing that every national forest of that state should also be regarded as a _state game preserve_! Both those things were done,--almost as soon as said! Mr. Carlos Avery, the Executive Agent of the Board of Game and Fish Commissioners of Minnesota is entitled to great credit for the action of his state, and we have to thank Mr. Gifford Pinchot and President Roosevelt for the executive action that represented the first half of the effort. The new Superior Preserve is valuable as a game and forest reserve, and nothing else. It is a wilderness of small lakes, marshes, creeks, hummocks of land, scrubby timber, and practically nothing of commercial value. But the wilderness contains many moose, and zoologically, it is for all practical purposes a moose preserve. In it, in 1908 Mr. Avery saw fifty-one moose in three days, Mr. Fullerton saw 183 in nine days, and Mr. Fullerton estimated the total number of moose in Minnesota as a whole at 10,000 head. In area it contains 1,420,000 acres, and the creation of this great preserve was accomplished on April 13, 1909. THE WICHITA NATIONAL GAME PRESERVE.--In the Wichita Mountains, of southwestern Oklahoma, there is a National game preserve containing 57,120 acres. On this preserve is a fenced bison range and a herd of thirty-nine American bison which owe their existence to the initiative of the New York Zoological Society. On March 25, 1905, the Society proposed to the National Government the founding of a range and herd, on a basis that was entirely new. To the Society it seemed desirable that for the encouragement of Congress in the preservation of species that are threatened with extermination, the scientific corporations of America, and private individuals also, should do something more than to offer advice and exhortations to the government. Accordingly, the Zoological Society offered to present to the Government, delivered on the ground in Oklahoma, a herd of fifteen pure-blood bison as the nucleus of a new national herd, provided Congress would furnish a satisfactory fenced range, and maintain the herd. The offer was at once accepted by Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture, and the Society was invited to propose a site for a range. The Society sent a representative to the Wichita National Forest Reserve, who recommended a range, and made a report upon it, which the Society adopted. By act of Congress the range was at once established and fenced. Its area is twelve square miles (9,760 acres). In October, 1908, the Zoological Society took from its herd in the Zoological Park nine female and six male bison, and delivered them at the bison range. There were many predictions that all those bison would die of Texas fever within one year; but the parties most interested persisted in trying conclusions with the famous tick of Texas. Mr. Frank Rush was appointed Warden of the new National Bison Range, and his management has been so successful that only two of the bison died of the fever, the disease has been stamped out, and the herd now contains thirty-nine head. Within five years it should reach the one-hundred mark. Elk, deer and antelope have been placed in the range, and all save the antelope are doing well. The Wichita Bison Range is an unqualified success. THE MONTANA NATIONAL BISON RANGE.--The opening of the Flathead Indian Reservation to settlement, in 1909, afforded a golden opportunity to locate in that region another national bison herd. Accordingly, in 1908, the American Bison Society formulated a plan by which the establishment of such a range and herd might be brought about. That plan was successfully carried into effect, in 1909 and '10. The Bison Society proposed to the national government to donate a herd of at least twenty-five bison, provided Congress would purchase a range, fence it and maintain the herd. The offer was immediately accepted, and with commendable promptness Congress appropriated $40,000 with which to purchase the range, and fence it. The Bison Society examined various sites, and finally recommended what was regarded as an ideal location situated near Ravalli, Montana, north of the Jocko River and Northern Pacific Railway, and east of the Flathead River. The nearest stations are Ravalli and Dixon. The area of the range is about twenty-nine square miles (18,521 acres) and for the purpose that it is to serve it is beautiful and perfect beyond compare. In it the bison herd requires no winter feeding whatever. In 1910 the Bison Society raised by subscription a fund of $10,526, and with it purchased 37 very perfect pure-blood bison from the famous Conrad herd at Kalispell, 22 of which were females. One gift bison was added by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Goodnight, two were presented by the estate of Charles Conrad, and three were presented from the famous Corbin herd, at Newport, N.H., by the Blue Mountain Forest Association. Starting with that nucleus (of 43 head) in 1910, the herd has already (1912) increased to 80 head. The herd came through the severe winter of 1911-1912 without having been fed any hay whatever, and the founders of it confidently expect to live to see it increase to one thousand head. THE GRAND CANYON NATIONAL GAME PRESERVE of northern Arizona, embraces the entire Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, for a meandering distance of 101 miles, and adjacent territory to an extent of 2,333 square miles (1,492,928 acres). Owing to certain conditions, natural and otherwise, it is not the finest place in the world for the peaceful increase of wild game. The Canyon contains a few mountain sheep, and mule deer, but Buckskin Mountain, on the northwestern side, is reeking with mountain lions and gray wolves, and both those species should be shot out of the entire Grand Canyon National Forest. It was on Buckskin and the western wall of the Canyon itself that ""Buffalo"" Jones, Mr. Charles S. Bird, and their party caught nine live mountain lions, in 1909. I regret to say that ""Buffalo"" Jones's catalo experiment on the Kaibab Plateau seems to have met an untimely and disappointing fate. For three years the bison and domestic cattle crossed, and produced a number of cataloes; but in 1911, practically the whole lot was wiped off the earth by cattle rustlers! Mr. Jones thinks that it was guerrillas from southern Utah who murdered his enterprise, partly for the reason that no other persons were within striking distance of the herd. MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK.--This fine forest park is the great summer outing ground of the people of the state of Washington. Its area is 324 square miles, and as its name implies it embraces Mount Rainier. Easily accessible from Seattle and Tacoma, and fairly well--though not _adequately_--provided with roads, trails, tent camps, hotels and livery transportation, it is really the Yellowstone Park of the Northwest. THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK in California is so well known that no description of it is necessary. Its area is 1,124 square miles (719,622 acres). Its great value lies in its scenery, but along with that it is a sanctuary for such of the wild mammals and birds of California as will not wander beyond its borders to the certain death that awaits everything that may legally be killed in that state. CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK.--Like all the National Parks of America generally, this one also is a game sanctuary. It is situated on the summit of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. The wonderful Crater Lake itself is 62 miles from Klamath Falls, 83 miles from Ashland, and it is 6 miles long, 4 miles wide and 200 feet deep. This National Park was created by Act of Congress in 1902. Its area is 249 square miles (159,360 acres), and it contains Columbian black-tailed deer, black bear, the silver-gray squirrel, and many birds, chiefly members of the grouse family. Owing to its lofty elevation, there are few ducks. THE SEQUOIA AND GENERAL GRANT NATIONAL PARKS were created for the special purpose of preserving the famous groves of ""big trees,"" _(Sequoia gigantea_). The former is in Tulare County, the latter in Tulare and Fresno counties, California, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas. The area of Sequoia Park is 169,605 acres, and that of General Grant Park is 2,560 acres. They are under the control of the Interior Department. These Parks are important bird refuges, and Mr. Walter Fry, Forest Ranger, reports in them the presence of 261 species of birds, none of which may be hunted or shot. Into Sequoia Park 20 dwarf elk and 84 wild turkeys have been introduced, the former from the herd of Miller and Lux. OTHER NATIONAL PARKS SULLY HILLS NATIONAL PARK, at Devil's Lake (Fort Totten), North Dakota. Area 960 acres. PLATT NATIONAL PARK, Sulphur Springs, Oklahoma; on account of many mineral springs. Area 848 acres. MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Southwestern Colorado; on account of cliff dwellings, and wonderful cliff and canyon scenery. Area, 66 square miles. * * * * * NATIONAL MONUMENTS Under a special act of Congress, the President of the United States has the power forever to set aside from private ownership and occupation any important natural scenery, or curiosity, or wonderland, the preservation of which may fairly be regarded as of National importance, and a duty to the whole people of the United States. This is accomplished by presidential proclamation creating a ""national monument."" Under the terms of this act, 28 national monuments have been created, up to 1912, of which 17 are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, and 11 are managed by the Department of Agriculture. The full list is as follows: ALASKA: COLORADO: SOUTH DAKOTA: Sitka Wheeler Jewel Cave Colorado ARIZONA: Montezuma Castle MONTANA: UTAH: Petrified Forest Lewis & Clark Cavern Natural Bridges Tonto Big Hole Battlefield Mukuntuweap Grand Canyon Rainbow Bridge Tumacacori Navajo NEW MEXICO: El Morro WASHINGTON: CALIFORNIA: Chaco Canyon Mount Olympus Lassen Peak Gila Cliff Dwellings Cinder Cove Gran Quivira Muir Woods WYOMING: Pinnacles OREGON: Devil's Tower Devil's Postpile Oregon Caves Shoshone Cavern * * * * * THE NATIONAL BIRD REFUGES.--Says Dr. T.S. Palmer[M]: ""National bird reservations have been established during the last ten years by Executive order for the purpose of affording protection to important breeding colonies of water birds, or to furnish refuges for migratory species on their northern or southern flights, or during winter. With few exceptions these reservations are either small rocky islets or tracts of marsh land of no agricultural value."" [Footnote M: National Reservations for the Protection of Wild Life, by T.S. Palmer, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Circular No. 87, Oct. 5, 1912.] These reservations are of immense value to bird life, and their creation represents the highest possible wisdom in utilizing otherwise valueless portions of the national domain. Dr. Palmer's alphabetical list of them is as follows, numbered in the order of their creation: Belle Fourche, S. Dak. 34 Bering Sea, Alaska 44 Bogoslof, Alaska 51 Breton Island, La. 2 Bumping Lake, Wash. 39 Carlsbad, N. Mex. 31 Chase Lake, N.

As a business proposition it is to-day no more a debatable question, or open to argument, than is the water supply or sewer system of a city. The only perfect way to conserve a water supply for a great human population is by acquiring title to water sheds, and either protecting the forests upon them, or planting forests in case none exist. In one important matter the state of Pennsylvania has been wide awake, and in advance of the times. I will cite her system of forest reserves and game preserves as a model plan for other states to follow; and I sincerely hope that by the time the members of the present State Game Commission have passed from earth the people of Pennsylvania will have learned the value of the work they are now doing, and at least give them the appreciation that is deserved by public-spirited citizens who do large things for the People without hope of material reward. At this moment, Commissioner John M. Phillips and Dr. Joseph Kalbfus are putting their heart's blood into the business of preserving and increasing the game and other wild life of Pennsylvania; and the utter lack of appreciation that is now being shown _in some quarters_ is really distressing. I refer particularly to the utterly misguided and mistaken body of hunters and anglers having headquarters at Harrisburg, whose members are grossly mislead into a wrong position by a man who seeks to secure a salaried state position through the hostile organization that he has built up, apparently for his own use. In the belief that those members generally are mislead and not mean-spirited, and that the organization contains a majority of conscientious sportsmen, I predict that ere long the evil genius of Pennsylvania game protection will be ordered to the rear, while the organization as a whole takes its place on the side of the Game Commission, where it belongs. The game sanctuary scheme that Pennsylvania has developed is so new that as yet only a very small fraction of the people of that state either understand it, or appreciate its far-reaching importance. To begin with, Pennsylvania has acquired up to date about one million acres of forest lands, scattered through 26 of the 67 counties of the state. These great holdings are to be gradually increased. These wild lands, including many sterile mountain ""farms"" of no real value for agricultural purposes, have been acquired, first of all, for the purpose of conserving the water supply of the state; and they are called the State Forest Reserves. Next in order, the State Game Commission has created, in favorable localities in the forest reserves, five great game preserves. The plan is decidedly novel and original, but is very simple withal. In the center of a great tract of forest reserve, a specially desirable tract has been chosen, and its boundaries marked out by the stringing of a single heavy fence wire, surrounding the entire selection. The area within that boundary wire is an absolute sanctuary for all wild creatures save those that prey upon game, and in it no man may hunt anything, nor fire a gun. The boundary wire is by no means a fence, for it keeps nothing out nor in. Outside of the wire and the sanctuary, men may hunt in the open season, but at the wire every chase must end. If the hunted deer knows enough to flee to the sanctuary when attacked, so much the better for the deer. The tide of wild life ebbs and flows under the wire, and beyond a doubt the deer and grouse will quickly find that within it lies absolute safety. There the breeding and rearing of young may go on undisturbed. In view of the fact that hunting may go on in the forest reserve areas surrounding these sanctuaries, no intelligent sportsman needs to be told that in a few years all such regions will be teeming with deer, grouse and other game. Where there is one deer to-day there will be twenty ten years hence,--because the law of Pennsylvania forbids the killing of does; and then there will be twenty times the legitimate hunting that there is to-day. For example, the Clinton County Game Preserve of 3,200 acres is surrounded by 128,000 acres of forest reserve, which form legitimate hunting grounds for the game bred in the sanctuary reservoir. In Clearfield County the game sanctuary is surrounded by 47,000 acres of Forest Reserve. The _game_ preserves created in Pennsylvania up to date are as follows: In Clinton County 3,200 acres In Clearfield County 3,200 acres In Franklin County 3,200 acres In Perry County 3,200 acres In Westmoreland County 2,500 acres It is the deliberate intention of the Game Commission to increase these game preserves until there is at least one in each county. It is the policy of the Commission to clear out of the game sanctuaries all the mammals and birds that destroy wild life, such as foxes, mink, weasels, skunks and destructive hawks and owls. This is accomplished partly by buying old horses, killing them in the preserves and poisoning them thoroughly with strychnine. Each preserve now contains a nucleus herd of white-tailed deer, some of them imported from northern Michigan. Ruffed grouse are breeding rapidly, and in the Clearfield County Preserve there are said to be at least three thousand. The Game Commission considers it a patriotic duty to preserve the wild turkey, ruffed grouse and quail, rather than have those species replaced at great expense by species imported from the old world. In their work for the protection, preservation and increase of the game of Pennsylvania--partly for the purpose of providing legitimate hunting for the mechanic as well as the millionaire,--the State Game Commissioners are putting a great amount of thought and labor, and whenever their efforts are criticized, their motives impugned or their honesty questioned by men who are not worthy to unlace their shoes, it makes me tired and angry. NEW YORK: THE ADIRONDACK STATE PARK.--With wise and commendable forethought, the state of New York has preserved in the Adirondack wilderness, familiarly known as ""the North Woods,"" a magnificent forest domain forever dedicated to campers, outdoorsmen and hunters. At present (1912) it contains 2,031 square miles (1,300,000 acres) of forest-clad hills, valleys and mountains, adorned by countless lakes and streams. By some persons it has been believed that in the State's forests the cutting and sale of large trees would be justifiable business, and agreeable to the public; but it has been demonstrated that this is not the case. The people of the state firmly object to the havoc that is _unavoidably_ wrought by logging operations in beautiful forests. The state does not yet need any of the money that could be derived from such operations. The chief anxiety of the public is that hereafter forest fires shall be prevented, no matter what fire protection may cost! The burning of coal on any railway operated through the Adirondacks should be made a penal offense. MONTANA: In 1911 Governor Norris, Senator Cone and the legislature of Montana, at the solicitation of W.R. Felton, L.A. Huffman and others, created the SNOW CREEK GAME PRESERVE, fronting for ten miles on the Missouri River, in the northern side of Dawson County. It is a magnificent tract of bad-lands, very deeply eroded and carved, and highly picturesque. The new state preserve contains 96 square miles, but there is so little grazing ground for antelope and bison it is absolutely imperative that a narrow strip of level grass land should be added along the southern border. This proposed addition is being fiercely resisted, by an organized movement of the sheep owners of Montana (the National Wool Growers' Association), who naturally want the public domain for the free grazing of their tariff-protected sheep-herds. It remains to be seen whether the _three_ sheep men south of the preserve,--the only men who really are affected,--will be able to thwart a movement that has for its object the development of a very good game preserve for the benefit of the ninety millions of the general American public. The range is necessary to contain representatives of the big game of the plains that has been so ruthlessly swept away, and particularly the vanishing prong-horned antelope, once very numerous in that region. In order to relieve the sheep men of all trouble on account of that preserve, the area should be enlarged to the right dimensions and made a national preserve. A bill for that purpose (Senate 5,286) is now before the Senate, in Senator McLean's Committee, and _help is needed_ to overcome the active hostility of the sheep men, _who vow that it never shall be passed_! All persons who read this are invited to take this matter up with their Senators and Representatives, without a moment's delay. WYOMING: THE TETON STATE PRESERVE.--One of the largest and most important state game preserves thus far established by any of our states is that which was created by Wyoming, in 1904. It is situated along the south of, and fully adjoining, the Yellowstone Park, and its area is 900 square miles (576,000 acres). Its special purpose is to supplement for the elk herds and other big game the protection from killing that previously had been found in the Yellowstone Park alone. The State Preserve is an admirable half-way house for the migrating herds when they leave the National Park to seek their regular winter ranges in and around the Jackson Valley. [Illustration: BIRD RESERVATIONS ON THE GULF COAST AND FLORIDA] In 1909, Wyoming established the Big Horn Game Preserve, in the mountain range of that name. Into it 25 elk were taken from Jackson Hole, and set free, in 1910, at the expense of the Sheridan County Sportsmen's Club. LOUISIANA: Great developments for the preservation of wild life have recently been witnessed in Louisiana, all due to the initiative and persistent activities of two men, Edward A. McIlhenny, of Avery Island, La., and Charles Willis Ward, of Michigan, lumberman and horticulturist. THE LOUISIANA STATE WILD FOWL REFUGE on Vermillion Bay, has an area of 13,000 acres. It was presented to the state by Messrs. Ward and McIlhenny, and formally accepted and protected. It contains a great area of fresh-water ponds and marshy meadows, wherein grows an abundant supply of food for wild fowl. It contains several miles of gravel beach, which during the winter season is visited by thousands of wild geese in quest of their indispensable supply of gravel. The ponds within its borders furnish feeding-grounds for canvasback ducks, redhead, mallard, blackhead and various species of wild geese.

We must no longer think of Ontario and Quebec as ""Canada West"" and ""Canada East,"" because the new assistant-nation owns and rules everything from Labrador to British Columbia, and all the northern mainland save Alaska. Although the fauna of Canada is strictly boreal, it is sufficiently dispersed and diversified to demand wise legislation, and plenty of it. For a nation with an outfit of provinces so new, Canada already is well advanced in the matter of game laws and game preserves, and in some respects she has set the pace for her southern neighbors. For example, in New Brunswick we see the lordly moose successfully hunted for sport, not only without being exterminated but actually on a basis that permits it to increase in number. In Nova Scotia we see a law in force _which successfully prohibits the waste of moose meat_, a loss that characterizes moose hunting everywhere else throughout the range of that animal. All over southern Canada the use of automatic shotguns in hunting is strictly prohibited. On the other hand, the laws of the Canadians are weak in not preventing the sale of all wild game and the killing of antelope. In the matter of game-selling, there are far too many open doors, and a sweeping reform is very necessary. Speaking generally, and with application from Labrador to British Columbia, the American process of game extermination according to law is vigorously and successfully being pursued by the people of Canada. The open seasons are too long, and the bag limits are too generous to the gunners. As it is elsewhere, the bag-limit laws on birds are a farce, because it is impossible to enforce them, save on every tenth man. For example, in his admirable ""Final Report of the Ontario Game and Fisheries Commission"" (1912), Commissioner Kelly Evans says: ""The prairie chicken, which formerly was comparatively plentiful throughout the greater portion of the Rainy River District, has now become practically extinct in that region. Various causes have been assigned for this, but it would seem, as usual, to have been mainly the fault of indiscriminate and excessive slaughter."" (Page 226.) Like the United States, the various portions of Canada have their various local troubles in wild-life protection. I think the greatest practical difficulties, and the most real opposition to adequate measures, is found in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Is it because the French-descended population is impatient of real restraint, and objects to measures that are drastic, even though they are necessary? In Ontario, Commissioner Evans has been splendidly supported by the Government, and by all the real sportsmen of that province; but the gunners and guerrillas of destruction have successfully postponed several of the reforms that he has advocated, and which should have been carried into effect. So far as _public_ moral support for game protection is concerned I think that the prairie and mountain provinces have the best of it. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Athabasca and British Columbia, the spirit of the people is mainly correct, and the chief thing that seems to be lacking is a Kelly Evans in each of those provinces to urge public sentiment into strong action. For example, why should Alberta still permit the hunting and killing of prong-horned antelope, when it is so well known that that species is vanishing like a mist before the morning sun? I think it is because no one seems to have risen up as G.O. Shields did in the United States, to make a big fuss about it, and demand a reform. At any rate, all the provinces of Canada that still possess antelope should _immediately pass laws giving that species absolute close seasons for ten years_. Why neglect it longer, when such neglect is now so very wrong? Whether this is done or not, I sincerely hope that hereafter no true American sportsman, will be guilty of killing one of the vanishing antelope of Canada, even though ""the law doth give it."" * * * * * THE GAME PRESERVES OF CANADA In the creation of National parks and game preserves, some of the provinces of the Canadian nation have displayed a degree of foresight and enterprise that merits sincere admiration. While in different provinces the exact status of these establishments may vary somewhat, the main purpose of each is the same,--the preservation of the forests and the wild life. In all of them a regulated amount of fishing is permitted, and in some the taking of fur-bearing animals is permitted; but I believe in all the birds and furless mammals are strictly protected. In some parks the carrying of firearms still is permitted, but that privilege is quite out of harmony with the spirit and purposes of a game preserve, and should be abolished. If it is necessary to carry firearms through a preserve, as often happens in the Yellowstone Park, it can be done under seals that are affixed by duly appointed officers and thus will temptation be kept out of the way of sinners. Up to this date I never have seen a publication which set forth in one place even so much as an annotated list of the game preserves of the various provinces of Canada, and at present exact information regarding them is rather difficult to obtain. It seems that an adequate governmental publication on this subject is now due, and overdue. ONTARIO.--""At the present time,"" says Commissioner Evans in his ""Final Report,"" ""the Algonquin National Park is the only actual game preserve in the Province, being in fact a game reserve and not a forest reserve; but in the past at least a measure of protection would seem to have been afforded the game in most of the [forest] reserves, owing to the fact that the carrying of firearms therein has been discouraged, and it would appear to require but the passing of an Order-in-Council to render the carrying of firearms in all reserves illegal. It is sincerely to be hoped that not only will such action be taken without delay, but also that all the forest reserves will be declared game reserves in the strictest sense."" To this sentiment all friends of wild life will join a fervent wish for its realization. As conditions are to-day, it is _impossible to have too many game reserves_! There is everything to gain and nothing to lose by making every national forest and forest reserve on the whole continent of North America a game preserve in the strictest sense, and we hope to live to see that end accomplished, both in the United States and Canada. _The Algonquin National Park_ is situated in the Parry Sound region, just above the Muskoka Lakes, and it has an area of 1,930 square miles. It is well stocked with moose, caribou, white-tailed deer, black bear and beaver. During the period of protection the beaver have increased so greatly that about 1,000 were trapped last year for the market, by officers of the government; and about 25 were sold to zoological gardens and parks, at $25 each. _The Quetico Forest Reserve_, area 1,560 square miles, was created as the Canadian complement of the Minnesota National Forest and Game Preserve. The two join on the international boundary, and each helps to protect the other. Both are well stocked with moose, and will render valuable service in the preservation of a mid-continental contingent of that species. ALBERTA.--In the making of game preserves the province of Alberta has been splendidly progressive and liberal. The total result is fairly beyond the reach of ordinary words of praise. It sets a pace that should result in wide-spread benefits to the wild life of North America. In it there is nothing faint-hearted. It should make some of our States think seriously regarding their own shortcomings in this particular field of endeavor. ALBERTA'S NATIONAL PARKS Acres Sq. miles Rocky Mountains Park 2,764,800 4,320 Yoho Park 1,799,680 2,812 Glacier Park 1,474,560 2,304 Buffalo Park 384,000 600 Elk Island Park 40,000 62 Jasper Park 3,488,000 5,450 Waterton Lakes Park 34,560 54 --------- ------ 9,985,600 15,602 _The Rocky Mountains Park_ is near Banff. The _Yoho_ and _Glacier Parks_ are near Field. The _Buffalo Park_ is near Wainwright, on the plains, and it was created and fenced especially as a home for the herd of American bison that was purchased in Montana in 1909. It now contains 1,052 head of bison, 20 moose, 35 deer, 7 elk, and 6 antelope. _The Elk Island Park_ is near Fort Saskatchewan and Lamont, and at this date (1912) it contains 53 bison, 28 elk, 30 deer and 5 moose. The bison subsist entirely by grazing, and upon hay cut within the Park. _Jasper Park_, established in 1908, is on the Athabasca River and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, near Strathcona. Sixty miles of the railway line lie within the Park. Scenically, Jasper Park is a rival of Rocky Mountains Park, and undoubtedly possesses great attractions for travellers who appreciate the beauties and grandeur of Nature as expressed in mountains, valleys, lakes and streams. _Waterton Lakes Park_ is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Alberta, in the Rocky Mountains surrounding the Waterton Lakes. At present it is nine miles long from north to south and six miles wide, with its southern end resting on the international boundary, and adjoining our Glacier Park. It is the home of a few bands of mountain sheep that carry very large horns. Through the initiative of Frederick K. Vreeland, the Camp-Fire Club of America two years ago represented to the Government of Alberta the great desirability of enlarging this preserve, toward the north and west, the better to protect the mountain sheep and other big game of that region. The suggestion was received in a friendly spirit, and there is good reason to hope that at an early date the enlargement will be made. BRITISH COLUMBIA.--This province has made an excellent beginning in the creation of game preserves. The first agitation on that subject was begun in 1906, by two sportsmen whose names in connection with it have long since been forgotten. On November 15, 1908, the Legislative Council of British Columbia issued a proclamation that created a very fine game preserve in the East Kootenai District, between the Elk and Bull Rivers and northwestward thereof to the White River country. By an unfortunate oversight, the new preserve never has been officially named, but we may designate it here as _The Elk River Game Preserve_.--This preserve has a total area of about 450 square miles, and includes a fine tract of mountains, valleys, lakes and streams. It contained in 1908 about 1,000 mountain goats, 200 sheep, a few elk and deer, and about 50 grizzly bears. All these have notably increased during the period of absolute protection that they have enjoyed. It is probable that this preserve contains more white mountain goats than any other preserve that thus far has been made. It was in this region that Mr. John M. Phillips and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborne made the first mountain goat photographs ever made at close range. It is to be hoped that the protection of this preserve, both as to its wild life and its timber, will be made perpetual. _Frazer River Preserve_.--Next after the above there was created in British Columbia a game preserve covering a large portion of the mountain territory that rises between the North and South Forks of the Fraser River. It is about 75 miles long by 30 miles wide and contains about 2,250 square miles. Concerning its character and wild-life population we have no details. _Yalakom Game Preserve_.--On the north side of Bridge River (a western tributary of the Fraser), about twenty miles above Lilloet. there has been established a game preserve having an area of about 215 square miles. MANITOBA.--In the making of game preserves, Manitoba has made an excellent beginning. It is good to see from Duck Mountain in the north to Turtle Mountain in the south a chain of four liberal preserves, each one protected in unmistakable terms as follows: ""Carrying firearms, hunting or trapping strictly prohibited within this area."" The lake regions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta form what is probably the most important wild-fowl breeding-ground in North America. To a great extent it rests with those provinces to say whether the central United States shall have any ducks and geese, or not! _It is high time that an international treaty should be made between the United States, Canada and Mexico for the federal protection of all migratory birds_. These preserves are of course intended to conserve wild-fowl, shore-birds, grouse and all other birds, as well as big game. Thanks to the cooperation of Mr. J.M. Macoun, of the Canadian Geological Survey, I am able to offer the following: LIST OF MANITOBA'S GAME PRESERVES DUCK MOUNTAIN PRESERVE 324 sq. miles, 207,360 acres. RIDING MOUNTAIN PRESERVE 360 "" "" 230,000 "" SPRUCE WOODS PRESERVE 64 "" "" 40,960 "" TURTLE MOUNTAIN PRESERVE 100 "" "" 64,000 "" 848 "" "" 542,320 "" Manitoba is to be congratulated on this record. QUEBEC.--This province has created two huge game preserves, well worthy of the fauna that they are intended to conserve when all hunting in them is prohibited! _The Laurentides National Park_ is second in area of all the national parks of Canada, being surpassed only by the Rocky Mountains Park of British Columbia. Its area is 3565 square miles, or 2,281,600 acres. It occupies the entire central portion of the great area surrounded by Lake St. John, the Saguenay River, the wide portion of the St. Lawrence, and the St. Maurice River on the west. Its southern boundary is in several places only 16 miles from the St. Lawrence, while its most northern angle is within 13 miles of Lake St. John. Its greatest width from east to west is 71 miles, and its greatest length from north to south is 79 miles. It covers a huge watershed in which over a dozen large rivers and many small ones have their sources. It is indeed a forest primeval. The rivers are well stocked with fish, and the big game includes moose, woodland caribou, black bear, lynx, beaver, marten, fisher, mink, fox, and--sad to say--the gray wolf. The caribou live in rather small bands, from 10 up to 100. Unfortunately, hunting under license is permitted in the Laurentian National Park, and therefore it is by no means a _real_ game preserve! It is a near-preserve. _The Gaspesian Forest, Fish and Game Preserve_, created in 1906, is in ""the Gaspe country,"" and it has an area of 2500 square miles situated in the eastern Quebec counties of Gaspe and Matane. _The Connaught National Park_, to be named in honor of H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, has been proposed by Mr. J.M. Macoun, of the Canadian Geological Survey. The general location chosen is the mountains and forested territory north of Ottawa and the Ottawa River, within easy access from the Canadian capitol. On the map the location recommended lies between the Gatineau River on the east and Wolf Lake on the west. The proposal is meeting with much popular favor, and it is extremely probable that it will be carried into effect at an early date. LABRADOR.--During the past two years Lieut.-Col. William Wood has strongly advocated the making of game preserves in Labrador, that will not only tend to preserve the scanty fauna of that region from extinction but will also aid in bringing it back. While Col. Wood's very energetic and praiseworthy campaign has not yet been crowned with success, undoubtedly it will be successful in the near future, because ultimately such causes always win their objects, provided they are prosecuted with the firm and unflagging persistence which has characterized this particular campaign. We congratulate Col. Wood on the success that he _will achieve_ in the near future! * * * * * GAME LAWS OF THE CANADIAN PROVINCES ALBERTA.--The worst feature of the Alberta laws is the annual open season on antelope, two of which may be killed under each license. This is _entirely wrong_, and a perpetual close season should at once be enacted. Duck shooting in August is wrong, and the season should not open until September. It is not right that duck-killing should be made so easy and so fearfully prolonged that extermination is certain. _All killing of cranes and shore birds should be absolutely stopped, for five years_. No wheat-producing province can afford the expense to the wheat crops of the slaughter of shore birds, _thirty species_ of which are great crop-protectors. The bag limit of two sheep is too high, by 50 per cent. It should immediately be cut down to one sheep, before sheep hunting in Alberta becomes a lost art. _Sheep hunting should not be encouraged_--quite the reverse! There are already too many sheep-crazy sportsmen. The bag limit on grouse and ptarmigan of 20 per day or 200 in a season is simply legalized slaughter, no more and no less, and if it is continued, a grouseless province will be the quick result. The birds are not sufficiently numerous to withstand the guns on that basis. Alberta should be wiser than the states below the international boundary that are annihilating their remnants of birds as fast as they can be found. BRITISH COLUMBIA.--We note with much satisfaction that the Provincial Game Warden, Mr. A. Bryan Williams, has been allowed $37,000 for the pay of game wardens, and $28,000 for the destruction of wolves, coyotes, pumas and other game-destroying animals. During the past two years the following game-destroyers were killed, and bounties were paid upon them: 1909-10 1910-11 Wolves 655 518 Coyotes 1,464 3,653 Cougars 382 277 Horned Owls 854 2,285 Golden Eagles 29 73 3,374 6,806 ""Now,"" says Warden Williams in his excellent annual report for 1911, ""in these two years a total of 2,896 wolves and cougars and 5,141 coyotes were destroyed, as well as a number of others poisoned and not recovered for the bounty. Allowing fifty head for each wolf and cougar and ten for each coyote, by their bounties alone 196,210 head of game and domestic animals were saved. Is it any wonder that deer are increasing almost everywhere?"" The great horned owl has been and still is a great scourge to the upland game birds, partly because when game is abundant ""they become fastidious, and eat only the brains of their prey."" The destruction of 3,139 of them on the Lower Mainland during the last two years has made these owls sing very small, and says the warden, ""Is it any wonder that grouse are again increasing?"" I have discussed with the Provincial Game Warden the advisability of putting a limit of one on the grizzly bear, but Mr. Williams advances good reasons for the opinion that it would be impracticable to do so at present. I am quite sure, however, that the time has already arrived when a limit of one is necessary. During the present year three of my friends who went hunting in British Columbia, _each killed 3 grizzly bears!_ Hereafter I will ""locate"" no more bear hunters in that country until the bag limit is reduced to one grizzly per year. Since 1905 the trapping of bears south of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway has been stopped; and an excellent move too. A Rocky Mountain without a grizzly bear is like a tissue-paper rose. The bag limit on the big game of British Columbia is at least twice too liberal,--five deer, two elk, two moose (one in Kootenay County), three caribou and three goats. There is no necessity for such wasteful liberality. Few sportsmen go to British Columbia for the sake of a large lot of animals. I know many men who have been there to hunt, and the great majority cared more for the scenery and the wild romance of camping out in ground mountains than for blood and trophies. MANITOBA.--What are we to think of a ""bag limit"" of fifty ducks per day in October and November? A ""limit"" indeed! Evidently, Manitoba is tired of having ducks, ruffed grouse, pinnated and other grouse pestering her farmers and laborers. While assuming to fix bag limits that will be of some benefit to those species, the limit is distinctly off, and nothing short of a quick and drastic reform will save a remnant that will remain visible to the naked eye. NEW BRUNSWICK.--This is the banner province in the protection of moose, caribou and deer, even while permitting them to be shot for sport. Of course, only males are killed, and I am assured by competent judges that thus far the killing of the finest and largest male moose has had no bad effect upon the stature or antlers of the species as a whole. NOVA SCOTIA.--If there is anything wrong with the game laws of Nova Scotia, it lies in the wide-open sale of moose meat and all kinds of feathered game during the open season. If that province were more heavily populated, it would mean a great destruction of game. Even with conditions as they are, the sale permitted is entirely wrong, and against the best interests of 97 per cent of the people. As previously mentioned, the law against the waste of moose meat is both novel and admirable. The saving of any considerable portion of the flesh of a full-grown bull moose, along with its head, is a large order; but it is right. The degree of accountability to which guides are held for the doings of the men whom they pilot into the woods is entirely commendable, and worthy of imitation. If a sportsman or gunner does the wrong thing, the guide loses his license. SASKATCHEWAN.--This is another of the too-liberal provinces having no real surplus of big game with which to sustain for any length of time an excess of generosity. I am told that in this province there is now a great deal of open country around each wild animal. And yet, it cheerfully offers two moose, two elk, two caribou and two _antelope_ per season to each licensed gunner or sportsman. The limit is too generous by half. Why throw away an extra $250 worth of game with each license? That is precisely what the people of Saskatchewan are doing to-day. And that antelope-killing! It should be stopped at once, and for ten years. YUKON.--This province permits the sale of all the finest and best wild game within its borders,--moose, elk, caribou, _bison_, musk-ox, sheep and goats! The flesh of all these may be sold during the open season, and for sixty days thereafter. Of the species named above, the barren ground caribou is the only one regarding which we need not worry; because that species still exists in millions. The Osborn caribou (_Rangifer osborni_), can be exterminated in our own times, because it is nowhere really numerous, and it inhabits exposed situations. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXVIII PRIVATE GAME PRESERVES Primarily, in the early days of the Man-on-Horseback, the self-elected and predatory lords of creation evolved the private game preserve as a scheme for preventing other fellows from shooting, and for keeping the game sacred to slaughter by themselves. The idea of conserving the game was a fourth-rate consideration, the first being the estoppel of the other man. The old-world owner of a game preserve delights in the annual killing of the surplus game, and we have even heard it whispered that in the Dark Ages there were kings who enjoyed the wholesale slaughter of deer, wild boar, pheasants and grouse. If we may accept as true the history of sport in Europe, there have been men who have loved slaughter with a genuine blood-lust that is quite foreign to the real nature-loving sportsman. In America, the impulse is different. Here, there is raging a genuine fever for private game preserves. Some of those already existing are of fine proportions, and cost fortunes to create. Every true sportsman who is rich enough to own a private game preserve, sooner or later acquires one. You will find them scattered throughout the temperate zone of North America from the Bay of Fundy to San Diego. I have had invitations to visit preserves in an unbroken chain from the farthest corner of Quebec to the Pacific Coast, and from Grand Island, Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico. It was not necessarily to hunt, and kill something, but to _see_ the game, and the beauties of nature. The wealthy American and Canadian joyously buys a tract of wilderness, fences it, stocks it with game both great and small, and provides game keepers for all the year round. At first he has an idea that he will ""hunt"" therein, and that his guests will hunt also, and actually kill game. In a mild way, this fiction sometimes is maintained for years. The owner may each year shoot two or three head of his surplus big game, and his tenderfoot guests who don't know what real hunting is may also kill something, each year. But in most of the American preserves with which I am well acquainted, the gentlemanly ""sport"" of ""hunting big game"" is almost a joke. The trouble is, usually, the owner becomes so attached to his big game, and admires it so sincerely, he has not the heart to kill it himself; and he finds no joy whatever in seeing it shot down by others! In this country the slaughter of game for the market is not considered a gentlemanly pastime, even though there is a surplus of preserve-bred game that must be reduced. To the average American, the slaughter of half-tame elk, deer and birds that have been bred in a preserve does not appeal in the least. He knows that in the protection of a preserve, the wild creatures lose much of their fear of man, and become easy marks; and shall a real sportsman go out with a gun and a bushel of cartridges, on a pony, and without warning betray the confidence of the wild in terms of fire and blood? Others may do it if they like; but as a rule that is not what an American calls ""sport."" One wide-awake and well-armed grizzly bear or mountain sheep outwitted on a mountain-side is worth more as a sporting proposition than a quarter of a mile of deer carcasses laid out side by side on a nice park lawn to be photographed as ""one day's kill."" In America, the shooting of driven game is something of which we know little save by hearsay. In Europe, it is practiced on everything from Scotch grouse to Italian ibex. The German Crown Prince, in his fascinating little volume ""From My Hunting Day-Book,"" very neatly fixes the value of such shooting, as a real sportsman's proposition, in the following sentence: ""The shooting of driven game is merely a question of marksmanship, and is after all more in the nature of a shooting exercise than sport."" I have seen some shooting in preserves that was too tame to be called sport; but on the other hand I can testify that in grouse shooting as it is done behind the dogs on Mr. Carnegie's moor at Skibo, it is sport in which the hunter earns every grouse that falls to his gun. At the same time, also, I believe that the shooting of madly running ibex, as it is done by the King of Italy in his three mountain preserves, is sufficiently difficult to put the best big-game hunter to the test. There are times when shooting driven game calls for far more dexterity with the rifle than is ordinarily demanded in the still-hunt. In America, as in England and on the Continent of Europe, private game preserves are so numerous it is impossible to mention more than a very few of them, unless one devotes a volume to the subject. Probably there are more than five hundred, and no list of them is ""up to date"" for more than one day, because the number is constantly increasing. I make no pretense even of possessing a list of those in America, and I mention only a few of those with which I am best acquainted, by way of illustration. One of the earliest and the most celebrated deer parks of the United States was that of Hon. John Dean Caton, of two hundred acres, located near Ottawa, Ill., established about 1859. It was the experiments and observations made in that park that yielded Judge Caton's justly famous book on ""The Antelope and Deer of America."" The first game preserve established by an incorporated club was ""Blooming Grove Park,"" of one thousand acres, in Pennsylvania, where great success has been attained in the breeding and rearing of white-tailed deer. In the eastern United States the most widely-known game preserve is Blue Mountain Forest Park, near Newport, New Hampshire. It was founded in 1885, by the late Austin Corbin, and has been loyally and diligently maintained by Austin Corbin, Jr., George S. Edgell and the other members of the Corbin family. Ownership is vested in the Blue Mountain Forest Association. The area of the preserve is 27,000 acres, and besides embracing much fine forest on Croydon Mountain, it also contains many converted farms whose meadow lands afford good grazing. This preserve contains a large herd of bison (86 head), elk, white-tailed deer, wild boar and much smaller game. The annual surplus of bison and other large game is regularly sold and distributed throughout the world for the stocking of other parks and zoological gardens. Each year a few surplus deer are quietly killed for the Boston market, but a far greater number are sold alive, at from $25 to $30 each in carload lots. In the Adirondacks of northern New York, there are a great many private game preserves. Dr. T.S. Palmer, in his pamphlet on ""Private Game Preserves"" (Department of Agriculture) places the number at 60, and their total area at 791,208 acres. Some of them have caused much irritation among some of the hunting, fishing and trapping residents of the Adirondack region. They seem to resent the idea of the exclusive ownership of lands that are good hunting-grounds. This view of property rights has caused much trouble and some bloodshed, two persons having been killed for presuming to assert exclusive rights in large tracts of wilderness property. ""In the upland preserve under private ownership."" says Dr. Palmer, ""may be found one of the most important factors in the maintenance of the future supply of game and game birds. Nearly all such preserves are maintained for the propagation of deer, quail, grouse, or pheasants. They vary widely in area, character, and purpose, and embrace some of the largest game refuges in the country. Some of the preserves in North Carolina cover from 15,000 to 30,000 acres; several in South Carolina exceed 60,000 acres in extent."" The Megantic Club's northern preserve, on the boundary between Quebec and Maine, embraces nearly 200 square miles, or upward of 125,000 acres. Comparatively few of the larger preserves are enclosed, and on such grounds, hunting becomes sport quite as genuine as it is in regions open to free hunting. In some instances part of the tract is fenced, while large unenclosed areas are protected by being posted. The character of their tenure varies also. Some are owned in fee simple; others, particularly the larger ones, are leased, or else comprise merely the shooting rights on the land. In both size and tenure, the upland preserves of the United States are comparable with the grouse moors and large deer forests of Scotland. Of the game preserves in the South, I know one that is quite ideal. It is St. Vincent Island, near Apalachicola, Florida, in the northern edge of the Gulf of Mexico. It was purchased in 1909 by Dr. Ray V. Pierce, and his guests kill perhaps one hundred ducks each year out of the thousands that flock to the ten big ponds that occupy the eastern third of the island. Into those ponds much good duck food has been introduced,--_Potamogeton pectinatus_ and _perfoliatus_. The area of the island is twenty square miles. Besides being a great winter resort for ducks, its sandy, pine-covered ridges and jungles of palms to and live oak afford fine haunts and feeding grounds for deer. Those jungles contain two species of white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus louisiana_ and _osceola_), and Dr. Pierce has introduced the Indian sambar deer and Japanese sika deer _(Cervus sika_), both of which are doing well. We are watching the progress of those big sambar deer with very keen interest, and it is to be recorded that already that species has crossed with the Louisiana white-tailed deer. [Illustration: MAP OF MARSH ISLAND AND ADJACENT WILD-FOWL PRESERVES] During the autumn of 1912, public attention in the United States was for a time focused on the purchase of Marsh Island, Louisiana, by Mrs. Russell Sage, and its permanent dedication to the cause of wild-life protection. This delightful event has brought into notice the Louisiana State Game Preserve of 13,000 acres near Marsh Island, and its hinterland (and water) of 11,000 acres adjoining, which constitutes the Ward-McIlhenny Wild Fowl Preserve. These three great preserves taken together as they lie form a wild-fowl sanctuary of great size, and of great value to the whole Mississippi Valley. Now that all duck-shooting therein has been stopped, it is safe to predict that they shortly will be inhabited by a wild-fowl population that will really stagger the imagination. DUCK-SHOOTING ""PRESERVES.""--A ducking ""preserve"" is a large tract of land and water owned by a few individuals, or a club, for the purpose of preserving exclusively for themselves and their friends the best possible opportunities for killing large numbers of ducks and geese without interference. In no sense whatever are they intended to preserve or increase the supply of wild fowl. The real object of their existence is duck and goose slaughter. For example, the worst goose-slaughter story on record comes to us from the grounds of the Glenn County Club in California, whereon, as stated elsewhere, two men armed with automatic shotguns killed 218 geese in one hour, and bagged a total of 452 in one day. I shall not attempt to give any list of the so-called ducking ""preserves."" The word ""preserve,"" when applied to them, is a misnomer. Thirteen states have these incorporated slaughtering-grounds for ducks and geese, the greatest number being in California, Illinois, North Carolina and Virginia. California has carried the ducking-club idea to the limit where it is claimed that it constitutes an abuse. Dr. Palmer says that one or two of the club preserves on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley contain upward of _40 square miles, or 25,000 acres each_! With considerable asperity it is now publicly charged (in the columns of _The Examiner_ of San Francisco) that for the unattached sportsmen there is no longer any duck-shooting to be had in California, because all the good ducking-grounds are owned and exclusively controlled by clubs. In many states the private game preserves are a source of great irritation, and many have been attacked in courts of law.[N] [Footnote N: ""Private Game Preserves and their Future in the United States,"" by T.S. Palmer, United States Department of Agriculture, 1910.] But I am not sorrowing over the woes of the unattached duck-hunter, or in the least inclined to champion his cause against the ducking-club member. As slaughterers and exterminators of wild-fowl, rarely exercising mercy under ridiculous bag-limits, they have both been too heedless of the future, and one is just as bad for the game as the other. If either of them favored the game, I would be on his side; but I see no difference between them. They both kill right up to the bag-limit, as often as they can; and that is what is sweeping away all our feathered game. Curiously enough, the angry unattached duck-hunters of California are to-day proposing to have revenge on the duck-clubbers by _removing all restrictions on the sale of game_! This is on the theory that the duckless sportsmen of the State of California would like to _buy_ dead ducks and geese for their tables! It is a novel and original theory, but the sane people of California never will enact it into law. It would be a step just _twenty years backward_! THE PUBLIC vs. THE PRIVATE GAME PRESERVE.--Both the executive and the judiciary branches of our state governments will in the future be called upon with increasing frequency to sit in judgment on this case. Conditions about us are rapidly changing. The precepts of yesterday may be out of date and worthless tomorrow. By way of introspection, let us see what principles of equity toward Man and Nature we would lay down as the basis of our action if we were called to the bench. Named in logical sequence they would be about as follows: 1. Any private game ""preserve"" that is maintained chiefly as a slaughter-ground for wild game, either birds or mammals, may become detrimental to the interests of the people at large. [Illustration: EGRETS AND HERONS IN SANCTUARY ON MARSH ISLAND] 2. It is not necessarily the duty of any state to provide for the maintenance of private death-traps for the wholesale slaughter of _migratory_ game. 3. An oppressive monopoly in the slaughter of migratory game is detrimental to the interests of the public at large, the same as any other monopoly. 4. Every de facto game preserve, maintained for the preservation of wild life rather than for its slaughter, is an institution beneficial to the public at large, and therefore entitled to legal rights and privileges above and beyond all which may rightly be accorded to the so-called ""preserves"" that are maintained as killing-grounds. 5. The law may justly discriminate between the actual game preserve and the mere killing-ground. 6. Whenever a killing-ground becomes a public burden, it may be abated, the same as any other public infliction. In private game preserves the time has arrived when lawmakers and judges must begin to apply the blood-test, and separate the true from the false. And at every step, _the welfare of the wild life involved_ must be given full consideration. No men, nor body of men, should be permitted to practice methods that spell extermination. * * * * * CHAPTER XXXIX BRITISH GAME PRESERVES IN AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA This brief chapter is offered as an object-lesson to the world at large. In the early days of America, the founders of our states and territories gave little heed, or none at all, to the preservation of wild life. Even if they thought of that duty, undoubtedly they felt that the game would always last, and that they had no time for such sentimental side issues as the making of game preserves. They were coping with troubles and perplexities of many kinds, and it is not to be wondered at that up to forty years ago, real game protection in America went chiefly by default. In South Africa, precisely the same conditions have prevailed until recent times. The early colonists were kept so busy shooting lions and making farms that not one game preserve was made. If any men can be excused from the work and worry of preserving game, and making preserves, it is those who spend their lives pioneering and state-building in countries like Africa. Men who continually have to contend with disease, bad food, rains, insect pests, dangerous wild beasts and native cussedness may well claim that they have troubles enough, without going far into campaigns to preserve wild animals in countries where animals are plentiful and cheap. It is for this reason that the people of Alaska can not be relied upon to preserve the Alaskan game. They are busy with other things that are of more importance to them. In May, 1900, representatives of the great powers owning territory in Africa held a conference in the interests of the wild-animal life of that continent. As a result a Convention was signed by which those powers bound themselves ""to make provision for the prevention of further undue destruction of wild game."" The principles laid down for universal observance were as follows: 1. Sparing of females and immature animals. 2. The establishment of close seasons and game sanctuaries. 3. Absolute protection of rare species. 4. Restrictions on export for trading purposes of skins, horns, tusks, etc. 5. Prohibition of the use of pits, snares and game traps. The brave and hardy men who are making for the British people a grand empire in Africa probably are greater men than far-distant people realize. To them, the white man's burden of game preservation is accepted as all in the day's work. A mere handful of British civil officers, strongly aided by the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the British Empire, have carved out and set aside a great chain of game preserves reaching all the way from Swaziland and the Transvaal to Khartoum. Taken either collectively or separately, it represents grand work, characteristic of the greatest colonizers on earth. Those preserves are worthy stones in the foundation of what one day will be a great British empire in Africa. The names of the men who proposed them and wrought them out should, in some way, be imperishably connected with them as their founders, as the least reward that Posterity can bestow. In Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton's fine work, ""Animal Life in Africa,""[O] the author has been at much pains to publish an excellent series of maps showing the locations of the various British game preserves in Africa, and the map published herewith has been based chiefly on that work. It is indeed fortunate for the wild life of Africa that it has today so powerful a champion and exponent as this author, the warden of the Transvaal Game Preserves. [Footnote O: Published by Heinemann, London, 1912.] Events move so rapidly that up to this date no one, so far as I am aware, has paused long enough to make and publish an annotated list of the African game preserves. Herein I have attempted to _begin_ that task myself, and I regret that at this distance it is impossible for me to set down under the several titles the names of the men who made these preserves possible, and actually founded them. To thoughtful Americans I particularly commend this list as a showing of the work of men who have not waited until the game had been _practically exterminated_ before creating sanctuaries in which to preserve it. In view of these results, how trivial and small of soul seems the mercenary efforts of the organized wool-growers of Montana to thwart our plan to secure a paltry fifteen square miles of grass lands for the rugged and arid Snow Creek Antelope Preserve that is intended to help save a valuable species from quick extermination. At this point I must quote the views of a high authority on the status of wild life and game preserves in Africa. The following is from Major Stevenson-Hamilton's book. ""It is a remarkable phenomenon in human affairs how seldom the experience of others seems to turn the scale of action. There are, I take it, very few farmers, in the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State, or the Transvaal, who would not be glad to see an adequate supply of game upon their land. Indeed, the writer is constantly dealing with applications as to the possibility of reintroducing various species from the game reserves to private farms, and only the question of expense and the difficulty of transport have, up to the present, prevented this being done on a considerable scale. When, therefore, the relatively small populations of such protectorates as are still well stocked with game are heard airily discussing the advisability of getting rid of it as quickly as possible, one realizes how often vain are the teachings of history, and how well-nigh hopeless it is to quote the result of similar action elsewhere. It remains only to trust that things may be seen in truer perspective ere it is too late, and that those in whose temporary charge it is may not cast recklessly away one of nature's most splendid assets, one, moreover, which once lightly discarded, can never by any possibility, be regained. [Illustration: THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME PRESERVES OF AFRICA The Numbers Refer to Corresponding Numbers in the Text] ""It is idle to say that the advance of civilization must necessarily mean the total disappearance of all wild animals. This is one of those glib fallacies which flows only too readily from unthinking lips. Civilization in its full sense--not the advent of a few scattered pioneers--of course, implies their restriction, especially as regards purely grass-feeding species, within certain definite bounds, both as regards numbers and sanctuaries. But this is a very different thing from wholesale destruction, that a few more or less deserving individuals may receive some small pecuniary benefit, or gratify their taste for slaughter to the detriment of everyone else who may come after. _The fauna of an empire is the property of that empire as a whole, and not of the small portion of it where the animals may happen to exist; and while full justice and encouragement must be given to the farmer and pioneer, neither should be permitted to entirely demolish for his own advantage resources which, strictly speaking, are not his own_.""--(""Animal Life in Africa."" p. 24.) * * * * * AFRICAN GAME PRESERVES BRITISH EAST AFRICA: 1.[P] _The Athi Plains Preserve_.--This is situated between the Uganda Railway and the boundary of German East Africa. Its northern boundary is one mile north of the railway track. It is about 215 miles long east and west by 105 miles from north to south, and its area is about 13,000 square miles. It is truly a great preserve, and worthy of the plains fauna that it is specially intended to perpetuate. [Footnote P: These numbers refer to corresponding numbers on the map of Africa.] 2. _The Jubaland Preserve_.--This preserve lies northwest of Mount Kenia. Its southwestern corner is near Lake Baringo, the Laikipia Escarpment is its western boundary up to Mt. Nyiro, and from that point its northern boundary runs 225 miles to Marsabit Lake. From that point the boundary runs south-by-west to the Guaso Nyiro River, which forms the eastern half of the southern boundary. Its total area appears to be about 13,000 square miles. In addition to the two great preserves described above the government of British East Africa has established on the Uasin Gishu Plateau a centrally located sanctuary for elands, roan antelopes and hippopotamii. There is also a small special rhinoceros preserve about fifty miles southeastward of Nairobi, around Kiu station, on the railway. EGYPTIAN SUDAN: 3. A great nameless sanctuary for wild life exists on the eastern bank of the Nile, comprising the whole territory between the main stream, the Blue Nile and Abyssinia. Its length (north and south) is 215 miles, and its width is about 125 miles; which means a total area of about 26,875 square miles. Natives and others living within this sanctuary may hunt therein--if they can procure licenses. SOMALILAND: 4. _Hargeis Reserve_, about 1,800 square miles. 5. _Mirso Reserve_, about 300 square miles. UGANDA: 6. _Budonga Forest Reserve_.--This small reserve embraces the whole eastern shore and hinterland of Lake Albert Nyanza, and is shaped like a new moon. 7. _Toro Reserve_.--This small reserve lies between Lakes Albert Nyanza and Albert Edward Nyanza, touching both. NYASALAND, OR THE BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA PROTECTORATE.--A small territory, but remarkably well stocked with game. 8. _Elephant Marsh Preserve_.--A small area in the extreme southern end of the Protectorate, on both sides of the Shire River, chiefly for buffalo. 9. _Angoniland Reserve_.--This was created especially to preserve about one thousand elephants. It is forty miles west of the southwestern arm of Lake Nyasa. TRANSVAAL: 10. _Sabi-Singwitza-Pongola Preserve_.--This great preserve occupies the whole region between the Drakenberg Mountains and the Lebombo Hills. Its total area is about 10,500 square miles. It lies in a compact block about 210 miles long by 50 miles wide, along the Portuguese border. 11. _Rustenburg Reserve_.--This is situated at the head of the Limpopo River, and covers about 3,500 square miles. SWAZILAND: 12. _The Swaziland Reserve_ contains about 1,750 square miles, and occupies the southwestern corner of Swaziland. RHODESIA: 13. _The Nweru Marsh Game Reserve_ is in northwestern Rhodesia, bordering the Congo Free State. The description of its local boundaries is quite unintelligible outside of Rhodesia. _Luangwa Reserve_.--The locality of this reserve cannot be determined from the official description, which gives no clue to its shape or size. * * * * * GAME PRESERVES IN AUSTRALASIA NEW ZEALAND: _Little Barrier Island_ in the north, and _Resolution Island_, in the south; and concerning both, details are lacking. AUSTRALIA: _Kangaroo Island_, near Adelaide, South Australia, is 400 miles northwest of Melbourne. Of the total area of this rather large island of 300 square miles, 140 square miles have been set aside as a game preserve, chiefly for the preservation of the mallee bird (_Lipoa occelata_). It is believed that eventually the whole island will become a wild-life sanctuary, and it would seem that this can not be consummated a day too soon for the vanishing wild life. _Wilson's Promontory_. Adelaide, is a peninsula well suited to the preservation of wild life, especially birds, and it is now a sanctuary. Many private bird refuges have been created in Australia. TASMANIA: _Eleven Bird Refuges_ have been created, with a total area of 26,000 acres,--an excellent record for Tasmania! _Freycinet's Peninsula_.--At present this wild-life sanctuary is not adequately protected from illicit hunting and trapping; but its full protection is now demanded, and no doubt this soon will be provided by the government. I am informed that this offers a golden opportunity to secure a fine wild-life sanctuary at ridiculously small cost to the public. The whole world is interested in the preservation of the remarkable fauna of Tasmania. The extermination of the thylacine would be a zoological calamity; but it is impending. * * * * * CHAPTER XL BREEDING GAME AND FUR IN CAPTIVITY GAME BREEDING.--The breeding of game in captivity for sale in the markets of the world is just as legitimate as the breeding of domestic species. This applies equally to mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes. It is the duty of the nation and the state to foster such industries and facilitate the marketing of their products without any unnecessary formalities, delays or losses to producers or to purchasers. Already this principle has been established in several states. Without going into the records, it is safe to say that Colorado was the pioneer in the so-called ""more-game"" movement, about 1899; but there is one person who would like to have the world believe that it started in the state of New York, about 1909. The idea is not quite as ""old as the hills,"" but the application of it in the United States dates back through a considerable vista of years. The laws of Colorado providing for the creation of private game preserves and the marketing of their product under a tagging system, are very elaborate, and they show a sincere desire to foster an industry as yet but slightly developed in this country. The laws of New York are much more simple and easy to understand than those of Colorado. There is one important principle now fully recognized in the New York laws for game breeding that other states will do well to adopt. It is the fact that certain kinds of wild game _can not be bred and reared in captivity on a commercial basis_; and this being true, it is clearly against public policy to provide for the sale of any such species. Why provide for the sale of preserve-bred grouse and ducks which we know can not be bred and reared in confinement in marketable numbers? For example, if we may judge by the numerous experiments that _thus far_ have been made,--as we certainly have a right to do,--no man can successfully breed and rear in captivity, on a commercial basis, the canvasback duck, teal, pintail duck, ruffed grouse or quail. This being the case, no amount of clamor from game dealers and their allies ever should induce any state legislature to provide for the sale of any of those species _until it has been fully demonstrated_ that they _have been_ and _can be_ bred in captivity in large numbers. The moment the markets of a state are thrown open to these impossible species, from that moment the state game wardens must make a continuous struggle to prevent the importation and sale of those birds contrary to law. This proposition is so simple that every honest man can see it. All that any state legislature may rightfully be asked to do is to provide for the sale, under tags, of those species which _we know_ can be bred in captivity in large numbers. When the Bayne law was drafted, its authors considered with the utmost care the possibilities in the breeding of game in the United States on a commercial basis. It was found that as yet only two wild native species have been, and can be, reared in captivity on a large scale. These are the white-tailed deer and mallard duck. Of foreign species we can breed successfully for market the fallow deer, red deer of Europe and some of the pheasants of the old world. For the rearing, killing and marketing of all these, the Bayne law provides the simplest processes of state supervision that the best game protectors and game breeders of New York could devise. The tagging system is expeditious, cheap and effective. Practically the only real concession that is required of the game-breeder concerns the killing, which must be done in a systematic way, whereby a state game warden can visit the breeder's premises and affix the tags without any serious sacrifice of time or convenience on either side. The tags cost the breeder five cents each, and they pay the cost of the services rendered by the state. By this admirable system, which is very plainly set forth in the New York Conservation Commission's book of game laws, all the _wild_ game of New York, _and of every other state_, is absolutely protected at all times against illegal killing and illegal importation for the New York market. Now, is it not the duty of Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and every other state to return our compliment by passing similar laws? Massachusetts came up to public expectations at the next session of her legislature after the passage of our Bayne law. In 1913, California will try to secure a similar act; and we know full well that her ducks, geese, quail, grouse and band-tailed pigeon need it very much. If the California protectors of wild life succeed in arousing the great quiet mass of people in that state, their Bayne bill will be swept through their legislature on a tidal wave of popular sentiment. _Elk_.--For people who own wild woodlands near large cities there are good profits to be made in rearing white-tailed deer for the market. I would also mention elk, but for the fact that every man who rears a fine herd of elk quickly becomes so proud of the animals, and so much attached to them, that he can not bear to have them shot and butchered for market! Elk are just as easy to breed and rear as domestic cattle, except that in the fall breeding season, the fighting of rival bulls demands careful and intelligent management. Concerning the possibilities of feeding elk on hay at $25 per ton and declaring an annual profit, I am not informed. If the elk require to be fed all the year round, the high price of hay and grain might easily render it impossible to produce marketable three-year-old animals at a profit. _White-tailed Deer_.--Any one who owns from one hundred to one thousand acres of wild, brushy or forest-covered land can raise white-tailed (or Virginia) deer at a profit. With smaller areas of land, free range becomes impossible, and the prospects of commercial profits diminish and disappear. In any event, a fenced range is absolutely essential; and the best fence is the Page, 88 inches high, all horizontals of No. 9 wire, top and bottom wires of No. 7, and the perpendicular tie-wires of No. 12. This fence will hold deer, elk, bison and wild horses. In large enclosures, the white-tailed deer is hardy and prolific, and when fairly cooked its flesh is a great delicacy. In Vermont the average weights of the deer killed in that state in various years have been as follow:--in 1902, 171 lbs.; in 1903, 190 lbs.; in 1905, 198 lbs.; in 1906, 200 lbs.; in 1907, 196 lbs.; in 1908, 207 lbs.; and in 1909, 155 lbs. The reason for the great drop in 1909 is yet to be ascertained. In 1910, in New York City the wholesale price of whole deer carcasses was from 22 to 25 cents per pound. Venison saddles were worth from 30 to 35 cents per pound. On the bill of fare of a first class hotel, a portion of venison costs from $1.50 to $2.50 according to the diner's location. It is probable that such prices as these will prevail only in the largest cities, and therefore they must not be regarded as general. Live white-tailed deer can be purchased for breeding purposes at prices ranging from $25 to $35 each. A good eastern source of supply is Blue Mountain Forest, Mr. Austin Corbin, president (Broadway and Cortlandt St., New York). In the West, good stock can be procured from the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, through C.V.R. Townsend, Negaunee, Mich., whose preserve occupies the whole of Grand Island, Lake Superior. The Department of Agriculture has published for free distribution a pamphlet entitled ""Raising Deer and Other Large Game Animals"" in the United States, by David E. Lantz, which contains much valuable information, although it leaves much unsaid. All breeders of deer are cautioned that during the fall and early winter months, all adult white-tailed bucks are dangerous to man, and should be treated accordingly. A measure of safety can be secured in a large park by compelling the deer always to keep at a respectful distance, and making no ""pets,"" whatever. Whenever a buck finds his horns and loses his fear of man, climb the fence quickly. Bucks in the rutting season sometimes seem to go crazy, and often they attack men, wantonly and dangerously. The method of attack is to an unarmed man almost irresistible. The animal lowers his head, stiffens his neck and with terrible force drives straight forward for your stomach and bowels. Usually there are eight sharp spears of bone to impale you. The best defense of an unarmed man is to seize the left antler with the left hand, and with the right hand pull the deer's right front foot from under him. Merely holding to the horns makes great sport for the deer. He loves that unequal combat. The great desideratum is to put his fore legs out of commission, and get him down on his knees. Does are sometimes dangerous, and inflict serious damage by rising on their hind feet and viciously striking with their sharp front hoofs. These tendencies in American deer are mentioned here as a duty to persons who may desire to breed deer for profit. _The Red Deer of Europe_.--Anyone who has plenty of natural forest food for deer and a good market within fair range, may find the European red deer a desirable species. It is of size smaller, and more easily managed, than the wapiti; and is more easily marketed because of its smaller size. As a species it is hardy and prolific, and of course its venison is as good as that of any other deer. Live specimens for stocking purposes can be purchased of S.A. Stephan, Agent for Carl Hagenbeck, Cincinnati Zoological Gardens, or of Wenz & Mackensen, Yardley, Pa., at prices ranging from $60 to $100 each, according to size and age. At present the supply of specimens in this country on hand for sale is very small. _The Fallow Deer_.--This species is the most universal park deer of Europe. It seems to be invulnerable to neglect and misuse, for it has persisted through countless generations of breeding in captivity, and the abuse of all nations. In size it is a trifle smaller than our white-tailed deer, with spots in summer, and horns that are widely flattened at the extremities in a very interesting way. It is very hardy and prolific, but of course it can not stand everything that could be put upon it. It needs a dry shed in winter, red clover hay and crushed oats for winter food; and no deer should be kept in mud. As a commercial proposition it is not so meaty as the white-tail, but it is _less troublesome to keep_. The adult males are not such vicious or dangerous fighters as white-tail bucks. Live specimens are worth from $50 to $75. The Essex County Park Commissioners (Orange, New Jersey) have had excellent success with this species. In 1906 they purchased twenty-five does and four bucks and placed them in an enclosure of 150 acres, on a wooded mountain-side. In 1912 they had 150 deer, and were obliged to take measures for a disposal of the surplus. Messrs. Wenz & Mackensen, keep an almost continuous supply of fallow deer on hand for sale. _The Indian Sambar Deer_.--I have long advocated the introduction in the southern states, _wherever deer can be protected_, of this great, hulking, animated venison-factory. While I have not delved deeply into the subject of weight and growth, I feel sure from casual observations of the growth of about twenty-five animals that this species produces more venison during the first two years of its life than any other deer with which I am acquainted. I regard it as the greatest venison-producer of the whole Deer Family; and I know that is a large order. The size of a yearling is almost absurd, it is so great for an animal of tender years. When adult, the species is for its height very large and heavy. As a food-producing animal, located in the southern hill forests and taking care of itself, ""there's millions in it!"" But _it must be kept under fence_; for in no southern (or northern) state would any such mass of juicy wild meat long be permitted to roam at large unkilled. Through this species I believe that a million acres of southern timber lands, now useless except for timber growth, could be made very productive in choice venison. The price would be,--a good fence, and protection from poachers. The Indian sambar deer looks like a short-legged big-bodied understudy of our American elk. It breeds well in captivity, and it is of quiet and tractable disposition. It can not live in a country where the temperature goes down to 25 degrees F. and _remains there for long periods_. It would, I am firmly convinced, do well all along the Gulf coast, and if acclimatized along the Gulf, with the lapse of time and generations it would become more and more hardy, grow more hair, and push its way northward, until it reached the latitude of Tennessee. But then, in a wild state it could not be protected from poachers. As stated elsewhere, Dr. Ray V. Pierce has successfully acclimatized and bred this species in his St. Vincent Island game preserve, near Apalachicola, Florida. More than that, the species has crossed with the white-tailed deer of the Island. Living specimen of the Indian Sambar deer are worth from $125 to $250, according to size and other conditions. Just at present it seems difficult for Americans to procure a sufficient number of _males!_ We have had very bad luck with several males that we attempted to import for breeding purposes. _The Mallard Duck_.--A great many persons have made persistent attempts to breed the canvasback, redhead, mallard, black duck, pintail, teal and other species, on a commercial basis. So far as I am aware the mallard is the only wild duck that has been bred in sufficient numbers to slaughter for the markets. The wood duck and mandarin can be bred in fair numbers, but only sufficient to supply the demand for _living_ birds, for park purposes. One would naturally suppose that a species as closely allied to the mallard as the black duck _is_ known to be, would breed like the mallard; but the black duck is so timid and nervous about nesting as to be almost worthless in captivity. All the species named above, except the mallard, must at present, and in general, be regarded as failures in breeding for the market. Of all American ducks the common mallard is the most persistent and successful breeder. It quickly becomes accustomed to captivity, it enjoys park life, and when given even half a chance it will breed and rear its young. Unquestionably, the mallard duck can be reared in captivity in numbers limited only by the extent of breeder's facilities. The amount of net profit that can be realized depends wholly upon the business acumen and judgment displayed in the management of the flock. The total amount of knowledge necessary to success is not so very great, but at the same time, the exercise of a fair amount of intelligence, and also careful diligence, is absolutely necessary. Naturally the care and food of the flock must not cost extravagantly, or the profits will inevitably disappear. As a contribution to the cause of game-breeding for the market, and the creation of a new industry of value, Mr. L.S. Crandall and the author wrote for the New York State Conservation Commission a pamphlet on ""Breeding Mallard Ducks for Market."" Copies of it can be procured of our State Conservation Commission at Albany, by enclosing ten cents in stamps. * * * * * BREEDING FUR-BEARING ANIMALS When hundreds of persons wrote to me asking for literature on the breeding of fur-bearing animals for profit, for ten years I was compelled to tell them that there was no such literature. During the past three years a few offerings have been made, and I lose not a moment in listing them here. ""_Life Histories of Northern Animals_"", by Ernest T. Seton (Charles Scribner's Sons, 2 volumes, $18), contains carefully written and valuable chapters on fox farming, skunk farming, marten farming, and mink farming, and other valuable life histories of the fur-bearing animals of North America. _Rod and Gun in Canada_, a magazine for sportsmen published by W.J. Taylor, Woodstock, Ontario, contained in 1912 a series of articles on ""The Culture of Black and Silver Foxes,"" by R.B. and L.V. Croft. _Country Life in America_ has published a number of illustrated articles on fox and skunk farming. With its usual enterprise and forethought, the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has published a valuable pamphlet of 22 pages on ""Silver Fox Farming,"" by Wilfred H. Osgood, copies of which can be procured by addressing the Secretary of Agriculture. In consulting that contribution, however, it must be borne in mind that just now, in fox farming, history is being made more rapidly than heretofore. I do not mean to say that the above are the only sources of information on fur-farming for profit, but they are the ones that have most impressed me. The files of all the journals and magazines for sportsmen contain numerous articles on this subject, and they should be carefully consulted. BLACK-FOX FARMING.--The ridiculous prices now being paid in London for the skins of black or ""silver"" foxes has created in this country a small furore over the breeding of that color-phase of the red fox. The prices that actually have been obtained, both for skins and for live animals for breeding purposes, have a strong tendency to make people crazy. Fancy paying $12,000 in real money for one pair of live black foxes! That has been done, on Prince Edward Island, and $10,000 per pair is now regarded as a bargain-counter figure. On Prince Edward Island, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, black-fox breeding has been going on for ten years, and is now on a successful basis. One man has made a fortune in the business, and it is rumored that a stock company is considering the purchase of his ten-acre fox ranch at a fabulous figure. The enormous prices obtainable for live black foxes, male or female, make diamonds and rubies seem cheap and commonplace; and it is no wonder that enterprising men are tempted to enter that industry. The price of a black fox is one of the wonders of a recklessly extravagant and whimsical age. All the fur-wearing world knows very well that fox fur is one of the poorest of furs to withstand the wear and tear of actual use. About two seasons' hard wear are enough to put the best fox skin on the wane, and three or four can be guaranteed to throw it into the discard. Even the finest black fox skin is nothing superlatively beautiful! A choice ""cross"" fox skin costing only $50 _is far more beautiful, as a color proposition_; but London joyously pays $2,500 or $3,000 for a single black-fox skin, to wear! Of course, all such fads as this are as ephemeral as the butterflies of summer. The Russo-Japanese war quickly reduced the value of Alaskan blue foxes from $30 to $18; and away went the Alaskan fox farms! A similar twist of Fortune's fickle wheel may in any year send the black fox out of royal favor, and remove the bottom from the business of producing it. Let us hope, however, that the craze for that fur will continue; for we like to see our friends and neighbors make good profits. PHEASANT REARING.--This subject is so well understood by game-breeders, and there is already so much good literature available regarding it, it is not necessary that I should take it up here. * * * * * CHAPTER XLI TEACHING WILD LIFE PROTECTION TO THE YOUNG Thousands of busy and burdened men and women are to-day striving hard, early and late, to promote measures that will preserve the valuable wild life of the world. They desire to leave to the boys and girls of tomorrow a good showing of the marvelous bird and animal forms that make the world beautiful and interesting. They are acting on the principle that the wild life of to-day is not ours, to destroy or to keep as we choose, but has been given to us _in trust_, partly for our benefit and partly for those who come after us and audit our accounts. They believe that we have no right to squander and destroy a wild-life heritage of priceless value which we have done nothing to create, and which is not ours to destroy. DUTY OF PARENTS.--This being the case, it is very necessary that the young people of to-day should be taught, early and often, the virtue and the necessity of wild-life protection. There is no reason that the boy of to-day should not take up his share of the common burden, just as soon as he is old enough to wander alone through the woods. Let him be taught in precise terms that he must _not rob birds' nests_, and that he _must not shoot song-birds, woodpeckers and kingfishers_ with a 22-calibre rifle, or any other gun. At this moment there lies upon my side table a vicious little 22-calibre rifle that was taken from two boys who were camping in the woods of Connecticut, and amusing themselves by shooting valuable insectivorous birds. Now those boys were not wholly to blame for what they were doing; but their fathers and mothers were _very much to blame_! They should have been taught at the parental knee that it is very wrong to kill any bird except a genuine game bird, and then only in the lawful open season. Those two fathers paid $10 each for having failed in their duty; and it served them right; for they were the real culprits. Small-calibre rifles are becoming alarmingly common in the hands of boys. _Parents must do their duty in the training of their boys against bird-shooting!_ It is a very serious matter. A million boys who roam the fields with small rifles without having been instructed in protection, can destroy an appalling number of valuable birds in the course of a year. Some parents are so slavishly devoted to their children that they wish them to do everything they please, and be checked in nothing. Such parents constitute one of the pests of society, and a drag upon the happiness of their own children! It is now the bounden duty of each parent to teach each one of his or her children that the time has come when the resources of nature, and especially wild life, must be conserved. To permit boys to grow up and acquire guns without this knowledge is very wrong. THE DUTY OF TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.--A great deal of ""nature study"" is being taught in the public schools of the United States. That the young people of our land should be taught to appreciate the works of nature, and especially animal life and plant life, is very desirable. Thus far, however, there is a screw loose in the system, and that is the shortage in definite, positive instruction regarding _individual duty_ toward the wild creatures, great and small. Along with their nature studies all our school children should be taught, in the imperative mood: 1. That it is wrong to disturb breeding birds, or rob birds' nests; 2. That it is wrong to destroy any harmless living creature not properly classed as game, except it be to preserve it in a museum; 3. That it is no longer right for civilized man to look upon wild game as _necessary_ food; because there is plenty of other food, and the remnant of game can not withstand slaughter in that basis; 4. That the time has come when it is the duty of every good citizen to take an active, aggressive part in _preventing_ the destruction of wild life, and in _promoting_ its preservation; 5. That every boy and girl over twelve years of age can do _something_ in this cause, and finally, 6. That protection and encouragement will bring back the almost vanished birds. We call upon all boards of education, all principals of schools and all teachers to educate our boys and girls, constantly and imperatively, along those lines. Teachers, do not say to your pupils,--""It is right and nice to protect birds,"" but say:--""It is your _Duty_ to protect all harmless wild things, and _you must do it_!"" In a good cause, there is great virtue in ""Must."" Really, we are losing each year an immense amount of available wild-life protection. The doctrine of imperative individual duty never yet has been taught in our schools as it should be taught. A few teachers have, indeed, covered this ground; but I am convinced that their proportion is mighty small. TEXT BOOKS.--The writers of the nature study text books are very much to blame because nine-tenths of the time this subject has been ignored. The situation has not been taken seriously, save in a few cases, by a very few authors. I am glad to report that in 1912 there was published a fine text book by Professor James W. Peabody, of the Morris High School, New York, and Dr. Arthur E. Hunt, in which from beginning to end the duty to protect wild life is strongly insisted upon. It is entitled ""Elementary Biology; Plants, Animals and Man."" Hereafter, no zoological or nature study text book should be given a place in any school in America unless the author of it has done his full share in setting forth the duty of the young citizen toward wild life. Were I a member of a board of education I would seek to establish and enforce this requirement. To-day, any author who will presume to write a text book of nature study or zoology without knowing and doing his duty toward our vanishing fauna, is too ignorant of wild life and too careless of his duty toward it, to be accepted as a safe guide for the young. The time for criminal indifference has gone by. Hereafter, every one who is not for the preservation of wild life is against it and it is time to separate the sheep from the goats. From this time forth, the preservation of our fauna should be regarded as a subject on which every candidate for a teacher's certificate should undergo an examination before receiving authority to teach in a public school. The candidate should be required to know _why_ the preservation of birds is necessary; why the slaughter of wild life is wrong and criminal; the extent to which wild birds and mammals return to us and thrive under protection; why wild game is no longer a legitimate food supply; why wild game should not be sold, and why the feathers of wild birds (other than game birds) never should be used as millinery ornaments. As sensible Americans, and somewhat boastful of our intelligence, we should put the education of the young in wild-life protection on a rational business basis. STATE EFFORTS.--In several of our states, systematic efforts to educate children in their duty toward wild life are already being made. To this end, an annual ""Bird Day"" has been established for state-wide observance. This splendid idea is now legally in force in the following states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. Bird Day is also more or less regularly observed, though not legally provided for, in New York, Indiana, Colorado and Alabama, and locally in some cities of Pennsylvania. Usually the observance of the day is combined with that of Arbor Day, and the date is fixed by proclamation of the Governor. Alabama and Wisconsin regularly issue elaborate and beautiful Arbor and Bird Day annuals; and Illinois, and possibly other states, have issued very good publications of this character. THE PHILLIPS EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE BIRDS.--Quite recently there has come under my notice an episode in the education of school children that has given the public profound satisfaction. I cite it here as an object lesson for pan-America. In Carrick, Pennsylvania, just across the Monongahela River from the city of Pittsburgh, lives John M. Phillips, State Game Commissioner, nature-lover, sportsman and friend of man. He is a man who does things, and gets results. Goat Mountain Park (450 square miles), in British Columbia, to-day owes its existence to him, for without his initiative and labor it would not have been established. It was the first game preserve of British Columbia. Three years ago, Mr. Phillips became deeply impressed by the idea that one of the best ways in the world to protect the wild life, both of to-day and the future, would be in teaching school children to love it and protect it. His fertile brain and open check-book soon devised a method for his home city. His theory was that by giving the children _something to do_, not only in protecting but in actually _bringing back_ the birds, much might be accomplished. [Illustration: BIRD DAY AT CARRICK, PA. Marching Behind the Governor] In studying the subject of bringing back the birds, he found that the Russian mulberry is one of the finest trees in the world as a purveyor of good fruit for many kinds of birds. The tree does not much resemble our native mulberry, but is equally beautiful and interesting. ""The fruit is not a long berry, nor is it of a purple color, but it grows from buds on the limbs and twigs something after the manner of the pussy-willow. It is smaller, of light color and has a very distinct flavor. The most striking peculiarity about the fruit is that it keeps on ripening during two months or more, new berries appearing daily while others are ripening. This is why it is such good bird food. Nor is it half bad for folks, for the berries are good to look at and to eat, either with cream or without, and to make pies that will set any sane boy's mouth a-watering at sight.""--(Erasmus Wilson). Everyone knows the value of sweet cherries, both to birds and to children. Mr. Phillips decided that he would give away several hundred bird boxes, and also several hundred sweet cherry and Russian mulberry trees. The first gift distribution was made in the early spring of 1909. Another followed in 1910, but the last one was the most notable. On April 11, 1912, Carrick had a great and glorious Bird Day. Mr. Phillips was the author of it, and Governor Tener the finisher. On that day occurred the third annual gift distribution of raw materials designed to promote in the breasts of 2,000 children a love for birds and an active desire to protect and increase them. Mr. Phillips gave away 500 bird boxes, 500 sweet cherry trees and 200 mulberry trees. The sun shone brightly, 500 flags waved in Carrick, the Governor made one of the best speeches of his life, and Erasmus Wilson, faithful friend of the birds, wrote this good story of the occasion for the _Gazette-Times_ of Pittsburgh: The Governor was there, and the children, the bird-boxes, and the young trees. And was there ever a brighter or more fitting day for a children and bird jubilee! The scene was so inspiring that Gov. Tener made one of the best speeches of his life. The distribution of several hundred cherry and mulberry trees was the occasion, and the beautiful grounds of the Roosevelt school, Carrick, was the scene. Mr. John M. Phillips, sane sportsman and enthusiastic friend of the birds, has been looking forward to this as the culmination of a scheme he has been working on for years, and he was more than pleased with the outcome. The intense delight it afforded him more than repaid him for all it has cost in all the years past. But it was impossible to tell who were the more delighted,--he, or the Governor, or the children, or the visitors who were so fortunate as to be present. County Superintendent of Schools Samuel Hamilton was simply a mass of delight. And how could he be otherwise, surrounded as he was by 2,000 and more children fairly quivering with delight? Children will care for and defend things that are their very own, fight for them and stand guard over them. Realizing this Mr. Phillips undertook to show them how they could have birds all their own. Being clever in devising schemes for achieving things most to be desired, he began giving out bird-boxes to those who would agree to put them up, and to watch and defend the birds when they came to make their homes with them. And he found that no more faithful sentinel ever stood on guard than the boy who had a bird-house all his own. Here was the solution to the vexed problem. Provide boxes for those who would agree to put them up, care for the birds, and study their habits and needs. The children agreed at once, and the birds did not object, so Mr. Phillips had some hundreds, four or five, blue-bird and wren boxes constructed during the past winter. These were passed out some weeks ago to any boys or girls who would present an order signed by their parents, and countersigned by the principal of the school. He knows enough about a boy to know that he does not prize the things that come without effort, nor will he become deeply interested in anything for which he is not held more or less responsible. Hence the advantage in having him write an order, have it indorsed by his parents, and vouched for by his school principal. That he had struck the right scheme was proven by the avidity with which the girls and boys rushed for the boxes. The fact that a heavy rain was falling did not dampen their ardor for a moment, nor did the fact that they were tramping Mr. Phillips' beautiful lawn into a field of mud. Mr. Phillips, seeing the necessity of providing food for the prospective hosts of birds, and wishing to place the responsibility on the boys and girls, offered to provide a cherry tree or mulberry tree for every box erected, provided they should be properly planted and diligently cared for. This was practically the culmination of the most unique bird scheme ever attempted, and yesterday was the day set apart for the distribution of these hundreds of fruit trees, the products of which are to be divided share and share alike with the birds. Nowhere else has such a scheme been attempted, and never before has there been just such a day of jubilee. The intense interest manifested by the children, and the earnest enthusiasm manifested, leaves no doubt about their carrying out their part of the contract. [Illustration: DISTRIBUTING BIRD BOXES AND FRUIT TREES] Up to date (1912) Mr. Phillips has given away about 1,000 bird boxes, 1,500 cherry and Russian mulberry trees, and transformed the schools of Carrick into seething masses of children militantly enthusiastic in the protection of birds, and in providing them with homes and food. As a final coup, Mr. Phillips has induced the city of Pittsburgh to create the office of City Ornithologist, at a salary of $1200 per year. The duty of the new officer is to protect all birds in the city from all kinds of molestation, especially when nesting; to erect bird-houses, provide food for wild birds, on a large scale, and report annually upon the increase or decrease of feathered residents and visitors. Mr. Frederic S. Webster, long known as a naturalist and practical ornithologist, has been appointed to the position, and is now on active duty. So far as we are aware, Pittsburgh is the first city to create the office of City Ornithologist. It is a happy thought; it will yield good results, and other cities will follow Pittsburgh's good example. * * * * * CHAPTER XLII THE ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP I count it as rather strange that American and English sportsmen have hunted and shot for a century, and until 1908 formulated practically nothing to establish and define the ethics of shooting game. Here and there, a few unwritten principles have been evolved, and have become fixed by common consent; but the total number of these is very few. Perhaps this has been for the reason that every free and independent sportsman prefers to be a law unto himself. Is it not doubly strange, however, that even down to the present year the term ""sportsmen"" never has been defined by a sportsman! Forty years ago, a sportsman might have been defined, according to the standards of that period, as a man who hunts wild game for pleasure. Those were the days wherein no one foresaw the wholesale annihilation of species, and there were no wilderness game preserves. In those days, gentlemen shot female hoofed game, trapped bears if they felt like it, killed ten times as much big game as they could use, and no one made any fuss whatever about the waste or extermination of wild life. Those were the days of ox-teams and broad-axes. To-day, we are living in a totally different world,--a world of grinding, crunching, pulverizing progress, a world of annihilation of the works of Nature. And what is a sportsman to-day? A SPORTSMAN is a man who loves Nature, and who in the enjoyment of the outdoor life and exploration takes a reasonable toll of Nature's wild animals, but not for commercial profit, and only so long as his hunting does not promote the extermination of species. In view of the disappearance of wild life all over the habitable globe, and the steady extermination of species, the ethics of sportsmanship has become a matter of tremendous importance. If a man can shoot the last living Burchell zebra, or prong-horned antelope, and be a sportsman and a gentleman, then we may just as well drop down all bars, and say no more about the ethics of shooting game. But the real gentlemen-sportsmen of the world are not insensible to the duties of the hour in regard to the taking or not taking of game. The time has come when canon laws should be laid down, of world-wide application, and so thoroughly accepted and promulgated that their binding force can not be ignored. Among other things, it is time for a list of species to be published which no man claiming to be either a gentleman or a sportsman can shoot for aught else than preservation in a public museum. Of course, this list would be composed of the species that are threatened with extermination. Of American animals it should include the prong-horned antelope, Mexican mountain sheep, all the mountain sheep and goats in the United States, the California grizzly bear, mule deer, West Indian seal and California elephant seal and walrus. In Africa that list should include the eland, white rhinoceros, blessbok, bontebok, kudu, giraffes and southern elephants, sable antelope, rhinoceros south of the Zambesi, leucoryx antelope and whale-headed stork. In Asia it should include the great Indian rhinoceros and its allied species, the burrhel, the Nilgiri tahr and the gayal. The David deer of Manchuria already is extinct in a wild state. In Australia the interdiction should include the thylacine or Tasmanian wolf, all the large kangaroos, the emu, lyre bird and the mallee-bird. Think what it would mean to the species named above if all the sportsmen of the world would unite in their defense, both actively and passively! It would be to those species a modus vivendi worth while. Prior to 1908, no effort (so far as we are aware) ever had been made to promote the establishment of a comprehensive and up-to-date code of ethics for sportsmen who shoot. A few clubs of men who are hunters of big game had expressed in their constitutions a few brief principles for the purpose of standardizing their own respective memberships, but that was all. I have not taken pains to make a general canvass of sportsmen's clubs to ascertain what rules have been laid down by any large number of organizations. The Boone and Crockett Club, of New York and Washington, had in its constitution the following excellent article: ""Article X. The use of steel traps, the making of large bags, the killing of game while swimming in water, or helpless in deep snow, and the unnecessary killing of females or young of any species of ruminant, shall be deemed offenses. Any member who shall commit such offenses may be suspended, or expelled from the Club by unanimous vote of the Executive Committee."" In 1906, this Club condemned the use of automatic shotguns in hunting as unsportsmanlike. The Lewis and Clark Club, of Pittsburgh, has in its constitution, as Section 3 of Article 3, the following comprehensive principle: ""The term 'legitimate sport' means not only the observance of local laws, but excludes all methods of taking game other than by fair stalking or still hunting."" At the end of the constitution of this club is this declaration, and admonition: ""_Purchase and sale of Trophies_.--As the purchase of heads and horns establishes a market value, and encourages Indians and others to ""shoot for sale,"" often in violation of local laws and always to the detriment of the protection of game for legitimate sport, the Lewis and Clark Club condemns the purchase or the sale of the heads or horns of any game."" In 1906 the Lewis and Clark Club condemned the use of automatic shotguns as unsportsmanlike. The Shikar Club, of London, a club which contains all the big-game hunters of the nobility and gentry of England,[Q] and of which His Majesty King George is Honorary President, has declared the leading feature of its ""Objects"" in the following terms: ""To maintain the standard of sportsmanship. It is not squandered bullets and swollen bags which appeal to us. The test is rather in a love of forest, mountains and desert; in acquired knowledge of the habits of animals; in the strenuous pursuit of a wary and dangerous quarry; in the instinct for a well-devised approach to a fair shooting distance; and in the patient retrieve of a wounded animal."" [Footnote Q: This organization contains in its list of members the most distinguished names in the modern annals of British sport and exploration. Its honorary membership, of eight persons, contains the names of three Americans: Theodore Roosevelt, Madison Grant and W.T. Hornaday; and of this fact at least one person is extremely proud!] In 1908 the Camp-Fire Club of America formally adopted, as its code of ethics, the ""Sportsman's Platform"" of fifteen articles that was prepared by the writer and placed before the sportsmen of America, Great Britain and her colonial dependencies in that year. In the book of the Club it regularly appears as follows: * * * * * CODE OF ETHICS OF THE CAMP-FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA _Proposed by Wm. T. Hornaday and adopted December 10, 1908_ 1. The wild animal life of to-day is not ours, to do with as we please. The original stock is given to us _in trust_, for the benefit both of the present and the future. We must render an accounting of this trust to those who come after us. 2. Judging from the rate at which the wild creatures of North America are now being destroyed, fifty years hence there will be no large game left in the United States nor in Canada, outside of rigidly protected game preserves. It is therefore the duty of every good citizen to promote the protection of forests and wild life and the creation of game preserves, while a supply of game remains. Every man who finds pleasure in hunting or fishing should be willing to spend both time and money in active work for the protection of forests, fish and game. 3. The sale of game is incompatible with the perpetual preservation of a proper stock of game; therefore it should be prohibited by laws and by public sentiment. 4. In the settled and civilized regions of North America there is no real _necessity_ for the consumption of wild game as human food: nor is there any good excuse for the sale of game for food purposes. The maintenance of hired laborers on wild game should be prohibited everywhere, under severe penalties. 5. An Indian has no more right to kill wild game, or to subsist upon it all the year round, than any white man in the same locality. The Indian has no inherent or God-given ownership of the game of North America, anymore than of its mineral resources; and he should be governed by the same game laws as white men. 6. No man can be a good citizen and also be a slaughterer of game or fishes beyond the narrow limits compatible with high-class sportsmanship. 7. A game-butcher or a market-hunter is an undesirable citizen, and should be treated as such. 8. The highest purpose which the killing of wild game and game fishes can hereafter be made to serve is in furnishing objects to overworked men for tramping and camping trips in the wilds; and the value of wild game as human food should no longer be regarded as an important factor in its pursuit. 9. If rightly conserved, wild game constitutes a valuable asset to any country which possesses it; and it is good statesmanship to protect it. 10. An ideal hunting trip consists of a good comrade, fine country, and a _very few_ trophies per hunter. 11. In an ideal hunting trip, the death of the game is only an incident; and by no means is it really necessary to a successful outing. 12. The best hunter is the man who finds the most game, kills the least, and leaves behind him no wounded animals. 13. The killing of an animal means the end of its most interesting period. When the country is fine, pursuit is more interesting than possession. 14. The killing of a female hoofed animal, save for special preservation, is to be regarded as incompatible with the highest sportsmanship; and it should everywhere be prohibited by stringent laws. 15. A particularly fine photograph of a large wild animal in its haunts is entitled to more credit than the dead trophy of a similar animal. An animal that has been photographed never should be killed, unless previously wounded in the chase. This platform has been adopted as a code of ethics by the following organizations, besides the Camp-Fire Club of America: The Lewis and Clark Club, of Pittsburgh, John M. Phillips, President. The North American Fish and Game Protective Association (International) Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association, Boston. Camp-Fire Club of Michigan, Detroit. Rod and Gun Club, Sheridan County, Wyoming. The platform has been endorsed and published by The Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the British Empire (London), which is an endorsement of far-reaching importance. Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton, C.M.Z.S., Warden of the Government Game Reserves of the Transvaal, South Africa, has adopted the platform and given it the most effective endorsement that it has received from any single individual. In his great work on game protection in Africa and wild-animal lore, entitled ""Animal Life in Africa"" (and ""very highly commended"" by the Committee on Literary Honors of the Camp-Fire Club), he publishes the entire platform, with a depth and cordiality of endorsement that is bound to warm the heart of every man who believes in the principles laid down in that document. He says, ""It should be printed on the back of every license that is issued for hunting in Africa."" I am profoundly impressed by the fact that it is high time for sportsmen all over the world to take to heart the vital necessity of adopting high and clearly defined codes of ethics, to suit the needs of the present hour. The days of game abundance, and the careless treatment of wild life have gone by, never to return. * * * * * CHAPTER XLIII THE DUTY OF AMERICAN ZOOLOGISTS AND EDUCATORS TO AMERICAN WILD LIFE The publication of this chapter will hardly be regarded as a bid for fame, or even popularity, on the part of the author. However, the subject can not be ignored simply because it is disagreeable. Throughout sixty years, to go no further back, the people of America have been witnessing the strange spectacle of American zoologists, as a mass, so intent upon the academic study of our continental fauna that they seem not to have cared a continental about the destruction of that fauna. During that tragic period twelve species of North American birds have been totally exterminated, twenty-three are almost exterminated, and the mammals have fared very badly. If ""by their works ye shall know them,"" then no man can say that the men referred to have been conspicuous on the firing line in defense of assaulted wild life. In their hearts, we know that in an academic way the naturalists of America do care about wild-life slaughter, and the extermination of species; and we also know that perhaps fifty American zoologists have at times taken an active and serious interest in protection work. I am speaking now of the general body of museum directors and curators; professors and teachers of zoology in our institutions of learning--a legion in themselves; teachers of nature study in our secondary schools; investigators and specialists in state and government service; the taxidermists and osteologists; and the array of literary people who, like all the foregoing, _make their bread and butter out of the exploitation of wild life_. Taken as a whole, the people named above constitute a grand army of at least five thousand trained, educated, resourceful and influential persons. They all _depend upon wild life for their livelihood_. When they talk about living things, the public listens with respectful attention. Their knowledge of the value of wild life would be worth something to our cause; but thus far it never has been capitalized! These people are hard workers; and when they mark out definite courses and attainable goals, they know how to get results. Yet what do we see? For sixty long years, with the exception of the work of a corporal's guard of their number, this grand army has remained in camp, partly neglecting and partly refusing to move upon the works of the enemy. For sixty years, with the exception of the non-game-bird law, as a class and a mass they have left to the sportsmen of the country the dictating of laws for the protection of all the game birds, the mammals and the game fishes. When we stop to consider that the game birds alone embrace _154 very important species_, the appalling extent to which the zoologist has abdicated in favor of the sportsman becomes apparent. It is a very great mistake, and a wrong besides, for the zoologists of the country to abandon the game birds, mammals and fishes of North America to the sportsmen, to do with as they please! Yet that is practically what has been done. The time was, thirty or forty years ago, when wild life was so abundant that we did not need to worry about its preservation. That was the golden era of study and investigation. That era ended definitely in 1884, with the practical extermination of the wild American bison, partly through the shameful greed and partly through the neglect of the American people. We are now living _in the middle of the period of Extermination!_ The questions for every American zoologist and every sportsman to answer now are: Shall the slaughter of species go on to a quick end of the period? Shall we give posterity a birdless, gameless, fishless continent, or not? Shall we have close seasons, all over the country, for five or ten years, or for five hundred years? If we are courageous, we will brace up and answer these questions now, like men. If we are faint-hearted, and eager for peace at any price, then we will sidestep the ugly situation until the destroyers have settled it for us by the wholesale extermination of species. If the zoologist cares to know, then I will tell him that to-day the wild life of the world _can_ be saved by law, but _not by sentiment alone!_ You cannot ""educate"" a poacher, a game-hog, a market-gunner, a milliner or a vain and foolish woman of fashion. All these must be curbed and controlled _by law_. Game refuges alone will not save the wild life! _All_ species of birds, mammals and game fishes of North America must have more thorough and far-reaching protection than they now have. Do not always take your cue from the sportsmen, especially regarding the enactment of long close seasons! If you need good advice, or help about drafting a bill, write to Dr. T.S. Palmer, Department of Agriculture, Washington, and you will receive prompt and valuable assistance. The Doctor is a wise man, and there is nothing about protective laws that is unknown to him. Go to _your_ state senator and _your_ assemblyman with the bills that you know should be enacted into law, and assure them that those measures are necessary for the wild life, and beneficial to 98 per cent of the people _who own the wild life_. You will be heard with respectful attention, in any law-making body that you choose to enter. People who cannot give time and labor must supply you with money for your campaigns. _Ask_, and you will receive! I have proven this many times. With care and exactness account to your subscribers for the expenditure of all money placed in your hands, and you will receive continuous support. In times of great stress, print circulars and leaflets by the ten-thousand, and get them into the hands of the People, calling for _their_ help. Our 42,000 copies of the ""Wild Life Call"" (sixteen pages) were distributed by organizations all over the state of New York, and along with Mr. Andrew D. Meloy's letters to the members of the New York State League, aroused such a tidal wave of public sentiment against the sale of game that the Bayne bill was finally swept through the Legislature with only one dissenting vote! And yet, in the beginning not one man dared to hope that that very revolutionary measure could by any possibility be passed in its first year in New York State, even if it ever could be! It was the aroused Public that did it! This volume has been written (under great pressure) in order to put the whole situation before the people of America, including the zoologists, and to give them some definite information, state by state, regarding the needs of the hour. Look at the needs of your own state, in the ""Roll Call of States,"" and you will find work for your hand to do. Clear your conscience by taking hold now, to do everything that you can to stop the carnage and preserve the remnant. Twenty-five or fifty years hence, if we have a birdless and gameless continent, let it not be said that the zoologists of America helped to bring it about by wicked apathy. At this juncture, a brief survey of the attitude toward wild life of certain American institutions of national reputation will be decidedly pertinent. I shall mention only a few of the many that through their character and position owe specific duties to this cause. _Noblesse oblige_! * * * * * The Biological Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is a splendid center of activity and initiative in the preservation of our wild life. The work of Dr. T.S. Palmer has already been spoken of, and thanks to his efforts and direction, the Survey has become the recognized special champion of preservation in America. The U.S. Forestry Bureau is developing into a very valuable ally, and we confidently look forward to the time when its influence in preservation will be a hundred times more potent than it is to-day. _That will be when every national forest is made a game preserve, and every forest ranger is made a game warden_. Let us have both those developments, and quickly. In 1896 the AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY became a center of activity in bird protection, and the headquarters of the New York State Audubon Society. The president of the Museum (Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn) is also the president of that organization. In several of the New York State movements for bird conservation, especially those bearing on the plumage law, the American Museum has been active, and at times conspicuous. No one (so I believe) ever appealed to the President of the Museum for help on the firing line without receiving help of some kind. Unfortunately, however, the preservation of wild life is not one of the declared objects of the American Museum corporation, or one on which its officers may spend money, as is so freely and even joyously done by the Zoological Society. The Museum's influence has been exerted chiefly through the active workers of the State Audubon Society, and it was as president of that body that Professor Osborn subscribed to the fund that was so largely instrumental in creating the New York law against the sale of game. There is room for an important improvement in the declared objects of the American Museum. To the cause of protection it is a distinct loss that that great and powerful institution should be unable to spend any money in promoting the preservation of our fauna from annihilation. An amendment to its constitution is earnestly recommended. The activities of the NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY began in 1896, and they do not require comment here. They have been continuous, aggressive and far-reaching, and they have been supported by thousands of dollars from the Society's treasury. It is true that the funds available for protection work have not represented a great annual sum, such as the work demands, but the amount being expended from year to year is steadily increasing. In serious emergencies there is _always something available_! During the past two years, to relieve the Society of a portion of this particular burden, the director of the Park secured several large subscriptions from persons outside the Society, who previously had never entered into this work. The MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM has entered actively and effectively into the fight to preserve the birds of Wisconsin from annihilation by the saloon-loafer element that three years ago determined to repeal the best bird laws on the books, and throw the shooting privilege wide open. Mr. Henry L. Ward, Director of the Museum, went to the firing line, and remained there. Last year the saloon element thought that they had a large majority of the votes in the legislature pledged to vote their way. It looked like it; but when the decent people again rose and demanded justice for the birds, the members of the legislature stood by them in large majorities. The spring-shooting, bag-limit and hunting-license laws were _not_ repealed. THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS (Lawrence) scored heavily for the cause of wild-life protection when in 1908 it gave to the Governor of the state the services of a member of its faculty, Professor Lewis Lindsay Dyche, who was wanted to fill the position of State Fish and Game Commissioner. Professor Dyche proved to be a very live wire, and his activities have covered the State of Kansas to its farthest corners. We love him for the host of enemies he has made--among the poachers, game-butchers, pseudo-""sportsmen"" and lawbreakers generally. The men who thought they had the ""pull"" of friendship for lawbreaking were first warned, and then as second offenders hauled up to the bar, one and all. The more the destroyers try to hound the Commissioner, the more popular is he with the great, solid mass of good citizens who believe in the saving of wild life. THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY has at last made a beginning in the field of protection. Last winter, while the great battle raged over the Wharton no-sale-of-game bill, several members of the Museum staff appeared at the hearings and otherwise worked for the success of the measure. It was most timely aid,--and very much needed. It is to be hoped that that auspicious beginning will be continued from year to year. The Museum should keep at least one good fighter constantly in the field. THE BOSTON SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY takes a very active part in promoting the preservation of the fauna of Massachusetts, and in resisting the attempts of the destroyers to repeal the excellent laws now in force. Its members put forth vigorous efforts in the great campaign of 1912. THE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES is well represented in the field of protection by Director Franklin W. Hooper, now president of the American Bison Society, and an earnest promoter of the perpetuation of the bison. When, the Wind Cave National Bison Herd is fully established, in South Dakota, as it practically _is already_, the chief credit for that coup will be due to the unflagging energy and persistence of Professor Hooper. THE BUFFALO ACADEMY OF SCIENCES in 1911 entered actively and effectively, under the leadership of Dr. Lee H. Smith, into the campaign for the Bayne bill. Besides splendid service rendered in western New York, Dr. Smith appeared in Albany with a strong delegation in support of the bill. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA was the first institution of learning to enter the field of wild-life protection for active, aggressive and permanent work. W.L. Taylor and Joseph Grinnell, of the University Museum, have taken up the fight to save the fauna of California from the dangers that now threaten it. At this point our enumeration of the activities of American zoological institutions comes to an unfortunate end. There are many individuals to be named elsewhere, in the roll of honor, but that is another story. I am now going to set before the public the names of certain institutions largely devoted to zoology and permeated by zoologists, which thus far seem to have entirely ignored the needs of our fauna, and which so far we know have contributed neither men, money nor encouragement to the Army of the Defense. * * * * * PARTIAL LIST OF INSTITUTIONS OWING SERVICE TO WILD LIFE. _The United States National Museum_ contains a large and expensive corps of zoological curators and assistant curators, some of whom long ago should have taken upon themselves the task of reforming the laws of the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland, at their very doors! This museum should maintain at least one man in the field of protection, and the existence of the Biological Survey is no excuse for the Museum's inactivity. _The Field Museum_ of Chicago is a great institution, but it appears to be inactive in wild-life protection, and indifferent to the fate of our wild life. Its influence is greatly needed on the firing line, especially in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and northern Minnesota. First of all the odious sale-of-game situation in Chicago should be cleaned up! _The Philadelphia Academy of Sciences_ has been represented on the A.O.U. Committee on Bird Protection by Mr. Witmer Stone. The time has come when this Academy should be represented on the firing line as a virile, wide-awake, self-sacrificing and aggressive force. It is perhaps the oldest zoological body in the United States! Its scientific standing is unquestioned. Its members _must_ know of the carnage that is going on around them, for they are not ignorant men. The Pennsylvania State Game Commission to-day stands in urgent need of active, vigorous and persistent assistance from the Philadelphia Academy in the fierce campaign already in progress for additional protective laws. Will that help be given? _The Carnegie Institute_ of Washington (endowment $22,000,000) unquestionably owes a great duty toward wild life, no portion of which has yet been discharged. Academic research work is all very well, but it does not save faunas from annihilation. In the saving of the birds and mammals of North America a hundred million people are directly interested, and the cause is starving for money, men and publicity. Education is not the ONLY duty of educators! _The Carnegie Museum_ at Pittsburgh should be provided by Pittsburgh with sufficient funds that its Director can put a good man into the field of protection, and maintain his activities. The State of Pennsylvania, and the nation at large, needs such a worker at Pittsburgh; and this statement is not open to argument! The California Academy of Sciences; | The Chicago Academy of Sciences; | Appear to have done nothing The New York Academy of Sciences; | noteworthy in promoting The National Academy of Sciences; | the preservation and increase The Rochester Academy of Sciences; | of the wild life of America. The Philadelphia Zoological Society; | The National Zoological Park; | * * * * * A FEW OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING WHICH SHOULD EACH DEVOTE ONE MAN TO THIS CAUSE. _Columbia University_, of New York, has a very large and strong corps of zoological professors in its Department of Biology. No living organism is too small or too worthless to be studied by high-grade men; but does any man of Columbia ever raise his voice, actively and determinedly, for the preservation of our fauna, or any other fauna? Columbia should give the services of one man wholly to this cause. There are men whose zoological ideals soar so high that they can not see the slaughter of wild creatures that is so furiously proceeding on the surface of this blood-stained earth. We don't want to hear about the ""behavior"" of protozoans while our best song birds are being exterminated by negroes and poor whites. _Cornell University_ should now awaken to the new situation. All the zoological Neros should not fiddle while Rome burns. For the sake of consistency, Cornell should devote the services of at least one member of its large and able faculty to the cause of wild-life protection. Cornell was a pioneer in forestry teaching; and why should she not lead off now in the new field? _Yale University_, in Professor James W. Toumey, Director of the School of Forestry, possesses a natural, ready-made protector of wild life. From forestry to wild life is an easy step. We hopefully look forward to the development of Professor Toumey into a militant protectionist, fighting for the helpless creatures that _must_ be protected by man _or perish_! If Yale is willing to set a new pace for the world's great universities, she has the Man ready at hand. _The University of Chicago_ should become the center of a great new protectionist movement which should cover the whole Middle West area, from the plains to Pittsburgh. This is the inflexible, logical necessity of the hour. _Either protect zoology, or else for very shame give up teaching it_! _Every higher institution of learning in America now has a duty in this matter_. Times have changed. Things are not as they were thirty years ago. To allow a great and valuable wild fauna to be destroyed and wasted is a crime, against both the present and the future. If we mean to be good citizens we cannot shirk the duty to conserve. We are trustees of the inheritance of future generations, and we have no right to squander that inheritance. If we fail of our plain duty, the scorn of future generations surely will be our portion. * * * * * CHAPTER XLIV THE GREATEST NEEDS OF THE WILD-LIFE CAUSE AND THE DUTY OF THE HOUR The fate of wild life in North America hangs to-day by three very slender threads, the names of which you will hardly guess unaided. They are Labor, Money and Publicity! The threads are slender because there is so little raw material in them. We do not need money with which to ""buy votes"" or ""influence,"" but money with which to pay workers; to publish things to arouse the American people; to sting sportsmen into action; to hire wardens; to prosecute game-hogs and buy refuges for wild life. If a sufficient amount of money for these purposes cannot be procured, then as sure as the earth continues to revolve, our wild life will pass away, forever. This is no cause for surprise, or wonder. In this twentieth century money is essential to every great enterprise, whether it be for virtue or mischief. The enemies of wild life, and the people who support them, are very powerful. The man whose pocket or whose personal privilege is threatened by new legislation is prompted by business reasons to work against you, and spend money in protecting his interests. Now, it happens that the men of ordinary means who have nothing personal at stake in the preservation of wild life save sentimental considerations, cannot afford to leave their business more than three or four days each year on protection affairs. Yet many times services are demanded for many days, or even weeks together, in order to accomplish results. Bad repeal bills must be fought until they are dead; and good protective bills must be supported until the breath of life is breathed into them by the executive signature. With money in hand, good men aways can be found who will work in game protection for about one-half what they would demand in other pursuits. With the men _whom, you really desire_, sentiment is always a controlling factor. It is my inflexible rule, however, in asking for services, that men who give valuable time and strength to the cause shall not be allowed to take their expense money from their own pockets. Soldiers on the firing line _cannot_ provide the sinews of war that come from the paymaster's chest! Campaigns of publicity are matters of tremendous necessity and importance; but their successful promotion requires hundreds, or possibly thousands of dollars, for each state that is covered. I believe that the wealthy men and women of America are the most liberal givers for the benefit of humanity that can be found in all the world. New York especially contains a great number of men who year in and year out work hard for money--in order to give it away! The depth and breadth of the philanthropic spirit in New York City is to me the most surprising of all the strange impulses that sway the inhabitants of that seething mass of mixed humanity. Every imaginable cause for the benefit of mankind,--save one,--has received, and still is receiving, millions of gift dollars. Some enterprises for the transcendant education of the people are at this moment hopelessly wallowing in the excess of wealth that has been thrust upon them. Men are being hired at high salaries to help spend wealth in high, higher, highest education and research. It is now fashionable to bequeath millions to certain causes that do not need them in the least! In education there is a mad scramble to educate every young man to the topmost notch, often far above his probable station in life, and into tastes and wants far beyond his powers to maintain. In all this, however, there would be no cause for regret if the wild life of our continent were not in such a grievous state. If we felt no conscience burden for those who come after us, we would not care where the millions go; but since things are as they are, it is heartbreaking to see the cause of wild-life protection actually starving, or at the best subsisting only on financial husks and crumbs, while less important causes literally flounder in surplus wealth. This regret is intensified by the knowledge that _in no other cause for the conservation of the resources most valuable to mankind will a dollar go so far, or bring back such good results, as in the preservation of wild life!_ The promotion of ""the Bayne bill"" and the enactment of the Bayne law is a fair example. That law is to-day on the statute books of the State of New York because fifty men and women promptly subscribed $5,000 to a fund formed with special reference to the expenses of the campaign for that measure; and the uplift of that victory will be felt for years to come, just as it already has been in Massachusetts. At one time I was tempted to show the financial skeleton in the closet of wild-life protection, by inserting here a statement of the funds available to be expended by all the New York organizations during the campaign year of 1911-1912. But I cannot do it. The showing is too painful, too humiliating. From it our enemies would derive too much comfort. Even in New York State, in view of the great interests at stake, the showing is pitiful. But what shall we say of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, and a dozen other states where the situation is much worse? In the winter of 1912 a cry for help came to us from a neighboring state, where a terrific fight was being made by the forces of destruction against all reform measures, and in behalf of retrogression on spring shooting. The appeal said: ""The situation in our legislature is the worst that it has been in years. Our enemies are very strong, well organized, and they fight us at every step. We have _no funds_, and we are expected to make bricks without straw! Is there not _something_ that you can do to help us?"" There was! Only one week previously, a good friend (who declines to be named) gave us _two thousand dollars_, of real money, for just such emergencies. Within thirty-six hours an entirely new fighting force had been organized and equipped for service. Within one week, those reinforcements had made a profound impression on the defenses of the enemy, and in the end the great fight was won. Of our small campaign fund it took away over one thousand dollars; but the victory was worth it. With money enough,--a reasonable sum,--the birds of North America, and some of the small-mammal species also, can be saved. The big game that is hunted and killed outside the game preserves, and outside of such places as New Brunswick and the Adirondacks, can _not_ be saved--until _each species_ is given perpetual protection. Colorado is saving a small remnant of her mountain sheep, but Montana and Wyoming are wasting theirs, because they allow killing, and the killers are ten times too numerous for the sheep. They imagine that by permitting only the killing of rams they are saving the species; but that is an absolute fallacy, and soon it will have a fatal ending. With an endowment fund of $2,000,000 (only double the price of the two old Velasquez paintings purchased recently by a gentleman of New York!) a very good remnant of the wild life of North America could be saved. But who will give the fund, or even a quarter of it? Thus far, the largest sums ever given in America for the cause of wild-life protection, so far as I know personally, have been the following: Albert Wilcox, to the National Association of Audubon Societies, $322,000 Mary Butcher Fund, to the National Association of Audubon Societies 12,000 Mrs. Russell Sage, for the purchase of Marsh Island 150,000 American Game Protective and Propagation Association, from the manufacturers of firearms and ammunition, annually 25,000 Charles Willis Ward and E.A. McIlhenny, purchase of game preserve presented to Louisiana 39,000 Mrs. Russell Sage, miscellaneous gifts to the National Audubon Society 20,000 The American Bison Society for the Montana National Herd 10,526 New York Zoological Society, total about 20,000 John E. Thayer, purchase of game preserve 5,000 Caroline Phelps Stokes Bird Fund, N.Y. Zoological Society 5,000 Boone and Crockett Fund for Preservation 5,000 A Friend in Rochester 2,500 Henry C. Frick 1,500 Samuel Thorne 1,250 Of all the above, the only endowment funds yielding an annual income are those of the National Association of Audubon Societies and the Caroline Phelps Stokes fund of $5,000 in the treasury of the Zoological Society. A fund of $25,000 per year for five years has been guaranteed by the makers of shot-guns, rifles and ammunition, to the American Game Protective and Propagation Association. This is like a limited endowment. In the civilized world there are citizens of many kinds; but all of them can be placed in two groups: (1) those with a sense of duty toward mankind, and who will do their duty as good citizens; and (2) those who from the cradle to the grave meanly and sordidly study their own selfish interests, who never do aught save in expectation of a quick return benefit, and who recognize no such thing as duty toward mankind at large. Men and women of the first class are honored in life, mourned when dead, and gratefully remembered by posterity. They leave the world better than they found it, and their lives have been successful. Men and women of the second class are merely so many pieces of animated furniture; and when they pass out the world cares no more than when old chairs are thrown upon the scrap-heap. There are many men so selfish, so ignorant and mean of soul that even out of well-filled purses they would not give ten dollars to save the whole bird fauna of North America from annihilation. To all persons of that brand, it is useless to appeal. As soon as you find one, waste no time upon him. Get out of his neighborhood as quickly as you can, and look for help among real MEN. The wild life of the world cannot be saved by a few persons, even though they work their hearts out in the effort. The cause needs two million more helpers; and they must be sought in Group No. 1. They are living, somewhere; but the great trouble is to find them, _before it is too late_. There are times and causes in which the good citizen has no option but to render service. The most important of such causes are: the relief of suffering humanity, the conservation of the resources of nature, and the prevention of vandalism. If the American Nation had refused aid to stricken San Francisco, the callous hard-heartedness of it would have shocked the world. If the German army of 1871 had destroyed the art treasures and the libraries of Paris, it would have set the German nation back ten centuries, into the ranks of the lowest barbarians. And yet, in America, and in the regions now being scourged by the feather trade, a wonderful FAUNA is being destroyed! It took _millions of years_ to develop that marvelous array of wild life; and when gone _it never can be replaced_! Yet the Army of Destruction is sweeping it away as joyously as a hired laborer cuts down a field of corn. That wild life _can_ be saved! If done, it must be done by the men and women of Group No. 1. The means by which it can be saved are: _Money, labor_ and _publicity. Every man of_ ordinary means and intelligence can contribute either money or labor. The men on the firing line must not be expected to furnish their own food and ammunition. The Workers MUST be provided with the money that active campaign work imperatively demands! Those who cannot conveniently or successfully labor should give money to this cause; but at the same time, every good citizen should keep in touch with his lawmaking representatives, and in times of need ask for votes for whatever new laws are necessary. With money enough to arouse the American people in certain ways, the wild life of North America (north of Mexico) can be saved. _Money_ can secure labor and publicity, and the People will do the rest. For this campaign work I want, _and must have_, a permanent fund of $10,000 per annum,--cash always ready for every emergency in field work. I greatly need, _and must have, immediately_, an endowment Wild-Life Fund of at least $100,000, and eventually $250,000. I can no longer ""pass the hat"" each year. This is needed in addition to the several thousands of dollars annually being expended by the Zoological Society in this work. The Society is already doing its utmost in wild-life protection, just as it is in several other fields of activity. Outside of New York many wealthy men will say, ""Let New York do it!"" That often is the way when national campaigning is to be done. In _national_ wild-life protection work, New York is to-day bearing about nine-tenths of the burden. It is my belief that in 1912 outside of New York City less than $10,000 was raised and expended in wild-life protection save by state and national appropriations. We know that in the year mentioned New York expended $221,000 in this cause, all from private sources. In a very short time I shall call for the $100,000 that I now must have as an endowment fund for nation-wide work, to be placed at 5-1/2 per cent interest for the $5,500 annual income that it will yield. How much of this will come from outside the State of New York? Some of it, I am sure, will come from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania; but will any of it come from Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco? * * * * * THE DUTY OF THE HOUR I have now said my say in behalf of wild life. Surely the path of duty toward the remnant of wild life is plain enough. Will those who read this book pass along my message that the hour for a revolution has struck? Will the millions of men commanded by General Apathy now arouse, before it is too late to act? Will the true sportsmen rise up, and do their duty, bravely and unselfishly? Will the people with wealth to give away do their duty toward wild life and humanity, fairly and generously? Will the zoologists awake, leave their tables in their stone palaces of peace, and come out to the firing-line? Will the lawmakers heed the handwriting on the wall, and make laws that represent the full discharge of their duty toward wild life and humanity? Will the editors beat the alarm-gong, early and late, in season and out of season, until the people awake? On the answers to these questions hang the fate of the wild creatures of the world,--their preservation or their extermination. * * * * * INDEX Abundance of wild life.

Sketch map of the hunt for buffalo Map illustrating the extermination of the American bison PREFATORY NOTE. It is hoped that the following historical account of the discovery, partial utilization, and almost complete extermination of the great American bison may serve to cause the public to fully realize the folly of allowing all our most valuable and interesting American mammals to be wantonly destroyed in the same manner. The wild buffalo is practically gone forever, and in a few more years, when the whitened bones of the last bleaching skeleton shall have been picked up and shipped East for commercial uses, nothing will remain of him save his old, well-worn trails along the water-courses, a few museum specimens, and regret for his fate. If his untimely end fails even to point a moral that shall benefit the surviving species of mammals _which are now being slaughtered in like manner_, it will be sad indeed. Although _Bison americanus_ is a true bison, according to scientific classification, and not a buffalo, the fact that more than sixty millions of people in this country unite in calling him a ""buffalo,"" and know him by no other name, renders it quite unnecessary for me to apologize for following, in part, a harmless custom which has now become so universal that all the naturalists in the world could not change it if they would. W. T. H. THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON, By WILLIAM T. HORNADAY, _Superintendent of the National Zoological Park._ PART I.--LIFE HISTORY OF THE BISON. I. DISCOVERY OF THE SPECIES. The discovery of the American bison, as first made by Europeans, occurred in the menagerie of a heathen king. In the year 1521, when Cortez reached Anahuac, the American bison was seen for the first time by civilized Europeans, if we may be permitted to thus characterize the horde of blood thirsty plunder seekers who fought their way to the Aztec capital. With a degree of enterprise that marked him as an enlightened monarch, Montezuma maintained, for the instruction of his people, a well-appointed menagerie, of which the historian De Solis wrote as follows (1724): ""In the second Square of the same House were the Wild Beasts, which were either presents to Montezuma, or taken by his Hunters, in strong Cages of Timber, rang'd in good Order, and under Cover: Lions, Tygers, Bears, and all others of the savage Kind which New-Spain produced; among which the greatest Rarity was the Mexican Bull; a wonderful composition of divers Animals. It has crooked Shoulders, with a Bunch on its Back like a Camel; its Flanks dry, its Tail large, and its Neck cover'd with Hair like a Lion. It is cloven footed, its Head armed like that of a Bull, which it resembles in Fierceness, with no less strength and Agility."" Thus was the first seen buffalo described. The nearest locality from whence it could have come was the State of Coahuila, in northern Mexico, between 400 and 500 miles away, and at that time vehicles were unknown to the Aztecs. But for the destruction of the whole mass of the written literature of the Aztecs by the priests of the Spanish Conquest, we might now be reveling in historical accounts of the bison which would make the oldest of our present records seem of comparatively recent date. Nine years after the event referred to above, or in 1530, another Spanish explorer, Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza, afterwards called Cabeza de Vaca--or, in other words ""Cattle Cabeza,"" the prototype of our own distinguished ""Buffalo Bill""--was wrecked on the Gulf coast, west of the delta of the Mississippi, from whence he wandered westward through what is now the State of Texas. In southeastern Texas he discovered the American bison on his native heath. So far as can be ascertained, this was the earliest discovery of the bison in a wild state, and the description of the species as recorded by the explorer is of historical interest. It is brief and superficial. The unfortunate explorer took very little interest in animated nature, except as it contributed to the sum of his daily food, which was then the all-important subject of his thoughts. He almost starved. This is all he has to say:[1] [Note 1: Davis' Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. 1869. P. 67.] ""Cattle come as far as this. I have seen them three times, and eaten of their meat. I think they are about the size of those in Spain. They have small horns like those of Morocco, and the hair long and flocky, like that of the merino. Some are light brown (_pardillas_) and others black. To my judgment the flesh is finer and sweeter than that of this country [Spain]. The Indians make blankets of those that are not full grown, and of the larger they make shoes and bucklers. They come as far as the sea-coast of Florida [now Texas], and in a direction from the north, and range over a district of more than 400 leagues. In the whole extent of plain over which they roam, the people who live bordering upon it descend and kill them for food, and thus a great many skins are scattered throughout the country."" Coronado was the next explorer who penetrated the country of the buffalo, which he accomplished from the west, by way of Arizona and New Mexico. He crossed the southern part of the ""Pan-handle"" of Texas, to the edge of what is now the Indian Territory, and returned through the same region. It was in the year 1542 that he reached the buffalo country, and traversed the plains that were ""full of crooke-backed oxen, as the mountaine Serena in Spaine is of sheepe."" This is the description of the animal as recorded by one of his followers, CastaÃ±eda, and translated by W. W. Davis:[2] [Note 2: The Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. Davis. 1869. Pp. 206-7.] ""The first time we encountered the buffalo, all the horses took to flight on seeing them, for they are horrible to the sight. ""They have a broad and short face, eyes two palms from each other, and projecting in such a manner sideways that they can see a pursuer. Their beard is like that of goats, and so long that it drags the ground when they lower the head. They have, on the anterior portion of the body, a frizzled hair like sheep's wool; it is very fine upon the croup, and sleek like a lion's mane. Their horns are very short and thick, and can scarcely be seen through the hair. They always change their hair in May, and at this season they really resemble lions. To make it drop more quickly, for they change it as adders do their skins, they roll among the brush-wood which they find in the ravines. ""Their tail is very short, and terminates in a great tuft. When they run they carry it in the air like scorpions. When quite young they are tawny, and resemble our calves; but as age increases they change color and form. ""Another thing which struck us was that all the old buffaloes that we killed had the left ear cloven, while it was entire in the young; we could never discover the reason of this. ""Their wool is so fine that handsome clothes would certainly be made of it, but it can not be dyed for it is tawny red. We were much surprised at sometimes meeting innumerable herds of bulls without a single cow, and other herds of cows without bulls."" Neither De Soto, Ponce de Leon, Vasquez de Ayllon, nor Pamphilo de Narvaez ever saw a buffalo, for the reason that all their explorations were made south of what was then the habitat of that animal. At the time De Soto made his great exploration from Florida northwestward to the Mississippi and into Arkansas (1539-'41) he did indeed pass through country in northern Mississippi and Louisiana that was afterward inhabited by the buffalo, but at that time not one was to be found there. Some of his soldiers, however, who were sent into the northern part of Arkansas, reported having seen buffalo skins in the possession of the Indians, and were told that live buffaloes were to be found 5 or 6 leagues north of their farthest point. The earliest discovery of the bison in Eastern North America, or indeed anywhere north of Coronado's route, was made somewhere near Washington, District of Columbia, in 1612, by an English navigator named Samuel Argoll,[3] and narrated as follows: ""As soon as I had unladen this corne, I set my men to the felling of Timber, for the building of a Frigat, which I had left half finished at Point Comfort, the 19. of March: and returned myself with the ship into Pembrook [Potomac] River, and so discovered to the head of it, which is about 65 leagues into the Land, and navigable for any ship. And then marching into the Countrie, I found great store of Cattle as big as Kine, of which the Indians that were my guides killed a couple, which we found to be very good and wholesome meate, and are very easie to be killed, in regard they are heavy, slow, and not so wild as other beasts of the wildernesse."" [Note 3: Purchas: His Pilgrimes. (1625.) Vol. IV, p. 1765. ""A letter of Sir Samuel Argoll touching his Voyage to Virginia, and actions there. Written to Master Nicholas Hawes, June, 1613.""] It is to be regretted that the narrative of the explorer affords no clew to the precise locality of this interesting discovery, but since it is doubtful that the mariner journeyed very far on foot from the head of navigation of the Potomac, it seems highly probable that the first American bison seen by Europeans, other than the Spaniards, was found within 15 miles, or even less, of the capital of the United States, and possibly within the District of Columbia itself. The first meeting of the white man with the buffalo on the northern boundary of that animal's habitat occurred in 1679, when Father Hennepin ascended the St. Lawrence to the great lakes, and finally penetrated the great wilderness as far as western Illinois. The next meeting with the buffalo on the Atlantic slope was in October, 1729, by a party of surveyors under Col. William Byrd, who were engaged in surveying the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia. As the party journeyed up from the coast, marking the line which now constitutes the interstate boundary, three buffaloes were seen on Sugar-Tree Creek, but none of them were killed. On the return journey, in November, a bull buffalo was killed on Sugar-Tree Creek, which is in Halifax County, Virginia, within 5 miles of Big Buffalo Creek; longitude 78Â° 40' W., and 155 miles from the coast.[4] ""It was found all alone, tho' Buffaloes Seldom are."" The meat is spoken of as ""a Rarity,"" not met at all on the expedition up. The animal was found in thick woods, which were thus feelingly described: ""The woods were thick great Part of this Day's Journey, so that we were forced to scuffle hard to advance 7 miles, being equal in fatigue to double that distance of Clear and Open Ground."" One of the creeks which the party crossed was christened Buffalo Creek, and ""so named from the frequent tokens we discovered of that American Behemoth."" [Note 4: Westover Manuscript. Col. William Byrd. Vol. I, p. 178.] In October, 1733, on another surveying expedition, Colonel Byrd's party had the good fortune to kill another buffalo near Sugar-Tree Creek, which incident is thus described:[5] [Note 5: Vol. II, pp. 24, 25.] ""We pursued our journey thro' uneven and perplext woods, and in the thickest of them had the Fortune to knock down a Young Buffalo 2 years old. Providence threw this vast animal in our way very Seasonably, just as our provisions began to fail us. And it was the more welcome, too, because it was change of dyet, which of all Varietys, next to that of Bed-fellows, is the most agreeable. We had lived upon Venison and Bear till our stomachs loath'd them almost as much as the Hebrews of old did their Quails. Our Butchers were so unhandy at their Business that we grew very lank before we cou'd get our Dinner. But when it came, we found it equal in goodness to the best Beef. They made it the longer because they kept Sucking the Water out of the Guts in imitation of the Catauba Indians, upon the belief that it is a great Cordial, and will even make them drunk, or at least very Gay."" A little later a solitary bull buffalo was found, _but spared_,[6] the earliest instance of the kind on record, and which had few successors to keep it company. [Note 6: _Ib._, p. 28.] II. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. The range of the American bison extended over about one-third of the entire continent of North America. Starting almost at tide-water on the Atlantic coast, it extended westward through a vast tract of dense forest, across the Alleghany Mountain system to the prairies along the Mississippi, and southward to the Delta of that great stream. Although the great plains country of the West was the natural home of the species, where it flourished most abundantly, it also wandered south across Texas to the burning plains of northeastern Mexico, westward across the Rocky Mountains into New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho, and northward across a vast treeless waste to the bleak and inhospitable shores of the Great Slave Lake itself. It is more than probable that had the bison remained unmolested by man and uninfluenced by him, he would eventually have crossed the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Range and taken up his abode in the fertile valleys of the Pacific slope. Had the bison remained for a few more centuries in undisturbed possession of his range, and with liberty to roam at will over the North American continent, it is almost certain that several distinctly recognizable varieties would have been produced. The buffalo of the hot regions in the extreme south would have become a short-haired animal like the gaur of India and the African buffalo. The individuals inhabiting the extreme north, in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake, for example, would have developed still longer hair, and taken on more of the dense hairyness of the musk ox. In the ""wood"" or ""mountain buffalo"" we already have a distinct foreshadowing of the changes which would have taken place in the individuals which made their permanent residence upon rugged mountains. It would be an easy matter to fill a volume with facts relating to the geographical distribution of _Bison americanus_ and the dates of its occurrence and disappearance in the multitude of different localities embraced within the immense area it once inhabited. The capricious shiftings of certain sections of the great herds, whereby large areas which for many years had been utterly unvisited by buffaloes suddenly became overrun by them, could be followed up indefinitely, but to little purpose. In order to avoid wearying the reader with a mass of dates and references, the map accompanying this paper has been prepared to show at a glance the approximate dates at which the bison finally disappeared from the various sections of its habitat. In some cases the date given is coincident with the death of the last buffalo known to have been killed in a given State or Territory; in others, where records are meager, the date given is the nearest approximation, based on existing records. In the preparation of this map I have drawn liberally from Mr. J. A. Allen's admirable monograph of ""The American Bison,"" in which the author has brought together, with great labor and invariable accuracy, a vast amount of historical data bearing upon this subject. In this connection I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to Professor Allen's work. While it is inexpedient to include here all the facts that might be recorded with reference to the discovery, existence, and ultimate extinction of the bison in the various portions of its former habitat, it is yet worth while to sketch briefly the extreme limits of its range. In doing this, our starting point will be the Atlantic slope east of the Alleghanies, and the reader will do well to refer to the large map. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.--There is no indisputable evidence that the bison ever inhabited this precise locality, but it is probable that it did. In 1612 Captain Argoll sailed up the ""Pembrook River"" to the head of navigation (Mr. Allen believes this was the James River, and not the Potomac) and marched inland a few miles, where he discovered buffaloes, some of which were killed by his Indian guides. If this river was the Potomac, and most authorities believe that it was, the buffaloes seen by Captain Argoll might easily have been in what is now the District of Columbia. Admitting the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the Pembrook River of Captain Argoll, there is yet another bit of history which fairly establishes the fact that in the early part of the seventeenth century buffaloes inhabited the banks of the Potomac between this city and the lower falls. In 1624 an English fur trader named Henry Fleet came hither to trade with the Anacostian Indians, who then inhabited the present site of the city of Washington, and with the tribes of the Upper Potomac. In his journal (discovered a few years since in the Lambeth Library, London) Fleet gave a quaint description of the city's site as it then appeared. The following is from the explorer's journal: ""Monday, the 25th June, we set sail for the town of Tohoga, where we came to an anchor 2 leagues short of the falls. * * * This place, without question, is the most pleasant and healthful place in all this country, and most convenient for habitation, the air temperate in summer and not violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of fish. The Indians in one night commonly will catch thirty sturgeons in a place where the river is not above 12 fathoms broad, and as for deer, buffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them. * * * The 27th of June I manned my shallop and went up with the flood, the tide rising about 4 feet at this place. We had not rowed above 3 miles, but we might hear the falls to roar about 6 miles distant.""[7] [Note 7: Charles Burr Todd's ""Story of Washington,"" p. 18. New York, 1889.] MARYLAND.--There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited Maryland, except what has already been adduced with reference to the District of Columbia. If either of the references quoted may be taken as conclusive proof, and I see no reason for disputing either, then the fact that the bison once ranged northward from Virginia into Maryland is fairly established. There is reason to expect that fossil remains of _Bison americanus_ will yet be found both in Maryland and the District of Columbia, and I venture to predict that this will yet occur. VIRGINIA.--Of the numerous references to the occurrence of the bison in Virginia, it is sufficient to allude to Col. William Byrd's meetings with buffaloes in 1620, while surveying the southern boundary of the State, about 155 miles from the coast, as already quoted; the references to the discovery of buffaloes on the eastern side of the Virginia mountains, quoted by Mr. Allen from Salmon's ""Present State of Virginia,"" page 14 (London, 1737), and the capture _and domestication_ of buffaloes in 1701 by the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, which was situated on the James River, about 14 miles above Richmond. Apparently, buffaloes were more numerous in Virginia than in any other of the Atlantic States. NORTH CAROLINA.--Colonel Byrd's discoveries along the interstate boundary between Virginia and North Carolina fixes the presence of the bison in the northern part of the latter State at the date of the survey. The following letter to Prof. G. Brown Goode, dated Birdsnest post-office, Va., August 6, 1888, from Mr. C. R. Moore, furnishes reliable evidence of the presence of the buffalo at another point in North Carolina: ""In the winter of 1857 I was staying for the night at the house of an old gentleman named Houston. I should judge he was seventy then. He lived near Buffalo Ford, on the Catawba River, about 4 miles from Statesville, N. C. I asked him how the ford got its name. He told me that his grandfather told him that when he was a boy the buffalo crossed there, and that when the rocks in the river were bare they would eat the moss that grew upon them."" The point indicated is in longitude 81Â° west and the date not far from 1750. SOUTH CAROLINA.--Professor Allen cites numerous authorities, whose observations furnish abundant evidence of the existence of the buffalo in South Carolina during the first half of the eighteenth century. From these it is quite evident that in the northwestern half of the State buffaloes were once fairly numerous. Keating declares, on the authority of Colhoun, ""and we know that some of those who first settled the Abbeville district in South Carolina, in 1756, found the buffalo there.""[8] This appears to be the only definite locality in which the presence of the species was recorded. [Note 8: Long's Expedition to the Source of the St. Peter's River, 1823, II, p. 26.] GEORGIA.--The extreme southeastern limit of the buffalo in the United States was found on the coast of Georgia, near the mouth of the Altamaha River, opposite St. Simon's Island. Mr. Francis Moore, in his ""Voyage to Georgia,"" made in 1736 and reported upon in 1744,[9] makes the following observation: [Note 9: Coll. Georgia Hist. Soc., I, p. 117.] ""The island [St. Simon's] abounds with deer and rabbits. There are no buffalo in it, though there are large herds upon the main."" Elsewhere in the same document (p. 122) reference is made to buffalo-hunting by Indians on the main-land near Darien. In James E. Oglethorpe's enumeration (A. D. 1733) of the wild beasts of Georgia and South Carolina he mentions ""deer, elks, bears, wolves, and buffaloes.""[10] [Note 10: Ibid., I, p. 51.] Up to the time of Moore's voyage to Georgia the interior was almost wholly unexplored, and it is almost certain that had not the ""large herds of buffalo on the main-land"" existed within a distance of 20 or 30 miles or less from the coast, the colonists would have had no knowledge of them; nor would the Indians have taken to the war-path against the whites at Darien ""under pretense of hunting buffalo."" ALABAMA.--Having established the existence of the bison in northwestern Georgia almost as far down as the center of the State, and in Mississippi down to the neighborhood of the coast, it was naturally expected that a search of historical records would reveal evidence that the bison once inhabited the northern half of Alabama. A most careful search through all the records bearing upon the early history and exploration of Alabama, to be found in the Library of Congress, failed to discover the slightest reference to the existence of the species in that State, or even to the use of buffalo skins by any of the Alabama Indians. While it is possible that such a hiatus really existed, in this instance its existence would be wholly unaccountable. I believe that the buffalo once inhabited the northern half of Alabama, even though history fails to record it. LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI.--At the beginning of the eighteenth century, buffaloes were plentiful in southern Mississippi and Louisiana, not only down to the coast itself, from Bay St. Louis to Biloxi, but even in the very Delta of the Mississippi, as the following record shows. In a ""Memoir addressed to Count de Pontchartrain,"" December 10, 1697, the author, M. de Remonville, describes the country around the mouth of the Mississippi, now the State of Louisiana, and further says:[11] ""A great abundance of wild cattle are also found there, which might be domesticated by rearing up the young calves."" Whether these animals were buffaloes might be considered an open question but for the following additional information, which affords positive evidence: ""The trade in furs and peltry would be immensely valuable and exceedingly profitable. We could also draw from thence a great quantity of buffalo hides every year, as the plains are filled with the animals."" In the same volume, page 47, in a document entitled ""Annals of Louisiana from 1698 to 1722, by M. Penicaut"" (1698), the author records the presence of the buffalo on the Gulf coast on the banks of the Bay St. Louis, as follows: ""The next day we left Pea Island, and passed through the Little Rigolets, which led into the sea about three leagues from the Bay of St. Louis. We encamped at the entrance of the bay, near a fountain of water that flows from the hills, and which was called at this time Belle Fountain. We hunted during several days upon the coast of this bay, and filled our boats with the meat of the deer, buffaloes, and other wild game which we had killed, and carried it to the fort (Biloxi)."" [Note 11: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, B. F. French, 1869, first series, p. 2.] The occurrence of the buffalo at Natchez is recorded,[12] and also (p. 115) at the mouth of Red River, as follows: ""We ascended the Mississippi to Pass Manchac, where we killed fifteen buffaloes. The next day we landed again, and killed eight more buffaloes and as many deer."" [Note 12: Ibid., pp. 88-91.] The presence of the buffalo in the Delta of the Mississippi was observed and recorded by D'Iberville in 1699.[13] [Note 13: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, French, second series, p. 58.] According to Claiborne,[14] the Choctaws have an interesting tradition in regard to the disappearance of the buffalo from Mississippi. It relates that during the early part of the eighteenth century a great drought occurred, which was particularly severe in the prairie region. For three years not a drop of rain fell. The Nowubee and Tombigbee Rivers dried up and the forests perished. The elk and buffalo, which up to that time had been numerous, all migrated to the country beyond the Mississippi, and never returned. [Note 14: Mississippi as a Province, Territory, and State, p. 484.] TEXAS.--It will be remembered that it was in southeastern Texas, in all probability within 50 miles of the present city of Houston, that the earliest discovery of the American bison on its native heath was made in 1530 by Cabeza de Vaca, a half-starved, half-naked, and wholly wretched Spaniard, almost the only surviving member of the celebrated expedition which burned its ships behind it. In speaking of the buffalo in Texas at the earliest periods of which we have any historical record, Professor Allen says: ""They were also found in immense herds on the coast of Texas, at the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda Bay), and on the lower part of the Colorado (Rio Grande, according to some authorities), by La Salle, in 1685, and thence northwards across the Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity Rivers."" Joutel says that when in latitude 28Â° 51' ""the sight of abundance of goats and bullocks, differing in shape from ours, and running along the coast, heightened our earnestness to be ashore."" They afterwards landed in St. Louis Bay (now called Matagorda Bay), where they found buffaloes in such numbers on the Colorado River that they called it La RiviÃ¨re aux Boeufs.[15] According to Professor Allen, the buffalo did not inhabit the coast of Texas east of the mouth of the Brazos River. [Note 15: The American Bisons, Living and Extinct, p. 132.] It is a curious coincidence that the State of Texas, wherein the earliest discoveries and observations upon the bison were made, should also now furnish a temporary shelter for one of the last remnants of the great herd. MEXICO.--In regard to the existence of the bison south of the Rio Grande, in old Mexico, there appears to be but one authority on record, Dr. Berlandier, who at the time of his death left in MS. a work on the mammals of Mexico. At one time this MS. was in the Smithsonian Institution, but it is there no longer, nor is its fate even ascertainable. It is probable that it was burned in the fire that destroyed a portion of the Institution in 1865. Fortunately Professor Allen obtained and published in his monograph (in French) a copy of that portion of Dr. Berlandier's work relating to the presence of the bison in Mexico,[16] of which the following is a translation: [Note 16: The American Bisons, pp. 129-130.] ""In Mexico, when the Spaniards, ever greedy for riches, pushed their explorations to the north and northeast, it was not long before they met with the buffalo. In 1602 the Franciscan monks who discovered Nuevo Leon encountered in the neighborhood of Monterey numerous herds of these quadrupeds. They were also distributed in Nouvelle Biscaye (States of Chihuahua and Durango), and they sometimes advanced to the extreme south of that country. In the eighteenth century they concentrated more and more toward the north, but still remained very abundant in the neighborhood of the province of Bexar. At the commencement of the nineteenth century we see them recede gradually in the interior of the country to such an extent that they became day by day scarcer and scarcer about the settlements. Now, it is not in their periodical migrations that we meet them near Bexar. Every year in the spring, in April or May, they advance toward the north, to return again to the southern regions in September and October. The exact limits of these annual migrations are unknown; it is, however, probable that in the north they never go beyond the banks of the Rio Bravo, at least in the States of Cohahuila and Texas. Toward the north, not being checked by the currents of the Missouri, they progress even as far as Michigan, and they are found in summer in the Territories and interior States of the United States of North America. The route which these animals follow in their migrations occupies a width of several miles, and becomes so marked that, besides the verdure destroyed, one would believe that the fields had been covered with manure. ""These migrations are not general, for certain bands do not seem to follow the general mass of their kin, but remain stationary throughout the whole year on the prairies covered with a rich vegetation on the banks of the Rio de Guadelupe and the Rio Colorado of Texas, not far from the shores of the Gulf, to the east of the colony of San Felipe, precisely at the same spot where La Salle and his traveling companions saw them two hundred years before. The Rev. Father Damian Mansanet saw them also as in our days on the shores of Texas, in regions which have since been covered with the habitations, hamlets, and villages of the new colonists, and from whence they have disappeared since 1828."" [Illustration: HEAD OF BUFFALO BULL From specimen in the National Museum Group. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] ""From the observations made on this subject we may conclude that the buffalo inhabited the temperate zone of the New World, and that they inhabited it at all times. In the north they never advanced beyond the 48th or 58th degree of latitude, and in the south, although they may have reached as low as 25Â°, they scarcely passed beyond the 27th or 28th degree (north latitude), at least in the inhabited and known portions of the country."" NEW MEXICO.--In 1542 Coronado, while on his celebrated march, met with vast herds of buffalo on the Upper Pecos River, since which the presence of the species in the valley of the Pecos has been well known. In describing the journey of Espejo down the Pecos River in the year 1584, Davis says (Spanish Conquest of New Mexico, p. 260): ""They passed down a river they called _Rio de las Vacas_, or the River of Oxen [the river Pecos, and the same Cow River that Vaca describes, says Professor Allen], and was so named because of the great number of buffaloes that fed upon its banks. They traveled down this river the distance of 120 leagues, all the way passing through great herds of buffaloes."" Professor Allen locates the western boundary of the buffalo in New Mexico even as far west as the western side of Rio Grande del Norte. UTAH.--It is well known that buffaloes, though in very small numbers, once inhabited northeastern Utah, and that a few were killed by the Mormon settlers prior to 1840 in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake. In the museum at Salt Lake City I was shown a very ancient mounted head of a buffalo bull which was said to have been killed in the Salt Lake Valley. It is doubtful that such was really fact. There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited the southwestern half of Utah, and, considering the general sterility of the Territory as a whole previous to its development by irrigation, it is surprising that any buffalo in his senses would ever set foot in it at all. IDAHO.--The former range of the bison probably embraced the whole of Idaho. Fremont states that in the spring of 1824 ""the buffalo were spread in immense numbers over the Green River and Bear River Valleys, and through all the country lying between the Colorado, or Green River of the Gulf of California, and Lewis' Fork of the Columbia River, the meridian of Fort Hall then forming the western limit of their range."" [In J. K. Townsend's ""Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky Mountains,"" in 1834, he records the occurrence of herds near the Mellade and Boise and Salmon Rivers, ten days' journey--200 miles--west of Fort Hall.] The buffalo then remained for many years in that country, and frequently moved down the valley of the Columbia, on both sides of the river, as far as the Fishing Falls. Below this point they never descended in any numbers. About 1834 or 1835 they began to diminish very rapidly, and continued to decrease until 1838 or 1840, when, with the country we have just described, they entirely abandoned all the waters of the Pacific north of Lewis's Fork of the Columbia [now called Snake] River. At that time the Flathead Indians were in the habit of finding their buffalo on the heads of Salmon River and other streams of the Columbia. OREGON.--The only evidence on record of the occurrence of the bison in Oregon is the following, from Professor Allen's memoir (p. 119): ""Respecting its former occurrence in eastern Oregon, Prof. O. C. Marsh, under date of New Haven, February 7, 1875, writes me as follows: 'The most western point at which I have myself observed remains of the buffalo was in 187 on Willow Creek, eastern Oregon, among the foot hills of the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. This is about latitude 44Â°. The bones were perfectly characteristic, although nearly decomposed.'"" The remains must have been those of a solitary and very enterprising straggler. THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES (British).--At two or three points only did the buffaloes of the British Possessions cross the Rocky Mountain barrier toward British Columbia. One was the pass through which the Canadian Pacific Railway now runs, 200 miles north of the international boundary. According to Dr. Richardson, the number of buffaloes which crossed the mountains at that point were sufficiently noticeable to constitute a feature of the fauna on the western side of the range. It is said that buffaloes also crossed by way of the Kootenai Pass, which is only a few miles north of the boundary line, but the number which did so must have been very small. As might be expected from the character of the country, the favorite range of the bison in British America was the northern extension of the great pasture region lying between the Missouri River and Great Slave Lake. The most northerly occurrence of the bison is recorded as an observation of Franklin in 1820 at Slave Point, on the north side of Great Slave Lake. ""A few frequent Slave Point, on the north side of the lake, but this is the most northern situation in which they were observed by Captain Franklin's party.""[17] [Note 17: Sabine, Zoological Appendix to ""Franklin's Journey,"" p. 668.] Dr. Richardson defined the eastern boundary of the bison's range in British America as follows: ""They do not frequent any of the districts formed of primitive rocks, and the limits of their range to the eastward, within the Hudson's Bay Company's territories, may be correctly marked on the map by a line commencing in longitude 97Â°, on the Red River, which flows into the south end of Lake Winnipeg, crossing the Saskatchewan to the westward of the Basquian Hill, and running thence by the Athapescow to the east end of Great Slave Lake."" Their migrations westward were formerly limited to the Rocky Mountain range, and they are still unknown in New Caledonia and on the shores of the Pacific to the north of the Columbia River; but of late years they have found out a passage across the mountains near the sources of the Saskatchewan, and their numbers to the westward are annually increasing.[18] [Note 18: Fauna Boreali-Americana, vol. 1, p, 279-280.] _Great Slave Lake._--That the buffalo inhabited the southern shore of this lake as late as 1871 is well established by the following letter from Mr. E. W. Nelson to Mr. J. A. Allen, under date of July 11, 1877:[19] ""I have met here [St. Michaels, Alaska] two gentlemen who crossed the mountains from British Columbia and came to Fort Yukon through British America, from whom I have derived some information about the buffalo (_Bison americanus_) which will be of interest to you. These gentlemen descended the Peace River, and on about the one hundred and eighteenth degree of longitude made a portage to Hay River, directly north. On this portage they saw thousands of buffalo skulls, and old trails, in some instances 2 or 3 feet deep, leading east and west. They wintered on Hay River near its entrance into Great Slave Lake, and here found the buffalo still common, occupying a restricted territory along the southern border of the lake. This was in 1871. They made inquiry concerning the large number of skulls seen by them on the portage, and learned that about fifty years before, snow fell to the estimated depth of 14 feet, and so enveloped the animals that they perished by thousands. It is asserted that these buffaloes are larger than those of the plains."" [Note 19: American Naturalist, xi, p. 624.] MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN.--A line drawn from Winnipeg to Chicago, curving slightly to the eastward in the middle portion, will very nearly define the eastern boundary of the buffalo's range in Minnesota and Wisconsin. ILLINOIS AND INDIANA.--The whole of these two States were formerly inhabited by the buffalo, the fertile prairies of Illinois being particularly suited to their needs. It is doubtful whether the range of the species extended north of the northern boundary of Indiana, but since southern Michigan was as well adapted to their support as Ohio or Indiana, their absence from that State must have been due more to accident than design. OHIO.--The southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern boundary of the bison's range in the eastern United States. La Hontan explored Lake Erie in 1687 and thus describes its southern shore: ""I can not express what quantities of Deer and Turkeys are to be found in these Woods, and in the vast Meads that lye upon the South side of the Lake. At the bottom of the Lake we find beeves upon the Banks of two pleasant Rivers that disembogue into it, without Cataracts or Rapid Currents.""[20] It thus appears that the southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern boundary of the buffalo's range in the eastern United States. [Note 20: J. A. Allen's _American Bisons_, p. 107.] NEW YORK.--In regard to the presence of the bison in any portion of the State of New York, Professor Allen considers the evidence as fairly conclusive that it once existed in western New York, not only in the vicinity of the eastern end of Lake Erie, where now stands the city of Buffalo, at the mouth of a large creek of the same name, but also on the shore of Lake Ontario, probably in Orleans County. In his monograph of ""The American Bisons,"" page 107, he gives the following testimony and conclusions on this point: ""The occurrence of a stream in western New York, called Buffalo Creek, which empties into the eastern end of Lake Erie, is commonly viewed as traditional evidence of its occurrence at this point, but positive testimony to this effect has thus far escaped me. ""This locality, if it actually came so far eastward, must have formed the eastern limit of its range along the lakes. I have found only highly questionable allusions to the occurrence of buffaloes along the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Keating, on the authority of Colhoun, however, has cited a passage from Morton's ""New English Canaan"" as proof of their former existence in the neighborhood of this lake. Morton's statement is based on Indian reports, and the context gives sufficient evidence of the general vagueness of his knowledge of the region of which he was speaking. The passage, printed in 1637 is as follows: They [the Indians] have also made descriptions of great heards of well growne beasts that live about the parts of this lake [Erocoise] such as the Christian world (untill this discovery) hath not bin made acquainted with. These Beasts are of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their hides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, being a kinde of wolle as fine almost as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make garments thereof. It is tenne yeares since first the relation of these things came to the eares of the English.' The 'beast' to which allusion is here made [says Professor Allen] is unquestionably the buffalo, but the locality of Lake 'Erocoise' is not so easily settled. Colhoun regards it, and probably correctly, as identical with Lake Ontario. * * * The extreme northeastern limit of the former range of the buffalo seems to have been, as above stated, in western New York, near the eastern end of Lake Erie. That it probably ranged thus far there is fair evidence."" PENNSYLVANIA.--From the eastern end of Lake Erie the boundary of the bison's habitat extends south into western Pennsylvania, to a marsh called Buffalo Swamp on a map published by Peter Kalm in 1771. Professor Allen says it ""is indicated as situated between the Alleghany River and the West Branch of the Susquehanna, near the heads of the Licking and Toby's Creeks (apparently the streams now called Oil Creek and Clarion Creek)."" In this region there were at one time thousands of buffaloes. While there is not at hand any positive evidence that the buffalo ever inhabited the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania, its presence in the locality mentioned above, and in West Virginia generally, on the south, furnishes sufficient reason for extending the boundary so as to include the southwestern portion of the State and connect with our starting point, the District of Columbia. III. ABUNDANCE. Of all the quadrupeds that have lived upon the earth, probably no other species has ever marshaled such innumerable hosts as those of the American bison. It would have been as easy to count or to estimate the number of leaves in a forest as to calculate the number of buffaloes living at any given time during the history of the species previous to 1870. Even in South Central Africa, which has always been exceedingly prolific in great herds of game, it is probable that all its quadrupeds taken together on an equal area would never have more than equaled the total number of buffalo in this country forty years ago. To an African hunter, such a statement may seem incredible, but it appears to be fully warranted by the literature of both branches of the subject. Not only did the buffalo formerly range eastward far into the forest regions of western New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, but in some places it was so abundant as to cause remark. In Mr. J. A. Allen's valuable monograph[21] appear a great number of interesting historical references on this subject, as indeed to every other relating to the buffalo, a few of which I will take the liberty of quoting. [Note 21: All who are especially interested in the life history of the buffalo, both scientific and economical, will do well to consult Mr. Allen's monograph, ""The American Bisons, Living and Extinct,"" if it be accessible. Unfortunately it is a difficult matter for the general reader to obtain it. A reprint of the work as originally published, but omitting the map, plates, and such of the subject-matter as relates to the extinct species, appears in Hayden's ""Report of the Geological Survey of the Territories,"" for 1875 (pp. 443-587), but the volume has for several years been out of print. The memoir as originally published has the following titles: _Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Kentucky.| N. S. Shaler, Director.| Vol. I. Part II.|--| The American Bisons,| living and extinct.| By J. A. Allen.| With twelve plates and map.|--| University press, Cambridge:| Welch, Bigelow & Co.| 1876._ _Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology,| at Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass.| Vol. IV. No. 10.|--| The American Bisons,| living and extinct.| By J. A. Allen.| Published by permission of N. S. Shaler, Director of the Kentucky| Geological Survey.| With twelve plates and a map.| University press, Cambridge:| Welch, Bigelow & Co.| 1876.|_ _4to., pp. i-ix, 1-246, 1 col'd map, 12 pl., 13 ll. explanatory, 2 wood-cuts in text._ These two publications were simultaneous, and only differed in the titles. Unfortunately both are of greater rarity than the reprint referred to above.] In the vicinity of the spot where the town of Clarion now stands, in northwestern Pennsylvania, Mr. Thomas Ashe relates that one of the first settlers built his log cabin near a salt spring which was visited by buffaloes in such numbers that ""he supposed there could not have been less than two thousand in the neighborhood of the spring."" During the first years of his residence there, the buffaloes came in droves of about three hundred each. Of the Blue Licks in Kentucky, Mr. John Filson thus wrote, in 1784: ""The amazing herds of buffaloes which resort thither, by their size and number, fill the traveller with amazement and terror, especially when he beholds the prodigious roads they have made from all quarters, as if leading to some populous city; the vast space of land around these springs desolated as if by a ravaging enemy, and hills reduced to plains; for the land near these springs is chiefly hilly. * * * I have heard a hunter assert he saw above one thousand buffaloes at the Blue Licks at once; so numerous were they before the first settlers had wantonly sported away their lives."" Col. Daniel Boone declared of the Red River region in Kentucky, ""The buffaloes were more frequent than I have seen cattle in the settlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or cropping the herbage of those extensive plains, fearless because ignorant of the violence of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the salt springs were amazing."" According to Ramsey, where Nashville now stands, in 1770 there were ""immense numbers of buffalo and other wild game. The country was crowded with them. Their bellowings sounded from the hills and forest."" Daniel Boone found vast herds of buffalo grazing in the valleys of East Tennessee, between the spurs of the Cumberland mountains. Marquette declared that the prairies along the Illinois River were ""covered with buffaloes."" Father Hennepin, in writing of northern Illinois, between Chicago and the Illinois River, asserted that ""there must be an innumerable quantity of wild bulls in that country, since the earth is covered with their horns. * * * They follow one another, so that you may see a drove of them for above a league together. * * * Their ways are as beaten as our great roads, and no herb grows therein."" Judged by ordinary standards of comparison, the early pioneers of the last century thought buffalo were abundant in the localities mentioned above. But the herds which lived east of the Mississippi were comparatively only mere stragglers from the innumerable mass which covered the great western pasture region from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains, and from the Rio Grande to Great Slave Lake. The town of Kearney, in south central Nebraska, may fairly be considered the geographical center of distribution of the species, as it originally existed, but ever since 1800, and until a few years ago, the center of population has been in the Black Hills of southwestern Dakota. Between the Rocky Mountains and the States lying along the Mississippi River on the west, from Minnesota to Louisiana, the whole country was one vast buffalo range, inhabited by millions of buffaloes. One could fill a volume with the records of plainsmen and pioneers who penetrated or crossed that vast region between 1800 and 1870, and were in turn surprised, astounded, and frequently dismayed by the tens of thousands of buffaloes they observed, avoided, or escaped from. They lived and moved as no other quadrupeds ever have, in great multitudes, like grand armies in review, covering scores of square miles at once. They were so numerous they frequently stopped boats in the rivers, threatened to overwhelm travelers on the plains, and in later years derailed locomotives and cars, until railway engineers learned by experience the wisdom of stopping their trains whenever there were buffaloes crossing the track. On this feature of the buffalo's life history a few detailed observations may be of value. Near the mouth of the White River, in southwestern Dakota, Lewis and Clark saw (in 1806) a herd of buffalo which caused them to make the following record in their journal: ""These last animals [buffaloes] are now so numerous that from an eminence we discovered more than we had ever seen before at one time; and if it be not impossible to calculate the moving multitude, which darkened the whole plains, we are convinced that twenty thousand would be no exaggerated number."" When near the mouth of the Yellowstone, on their way down the Missouri, a previous record had been made of a meeting with other herds: ""The buffalo now appear in vast numbers. A herd happened to be on their way across the river [the Missouri]. Such was the multitude of these animals that although the river, including an island over which they passed, was a mile in length, the herd stretched as thick as they could swim completely from one side to the other, and the party was obliged to stop for an hour. They consoled themselves for the delay by killing four of the herd, and then proceeded till at the distance of 45 miles they halted on an island, below which two other herds of buffalo, as numerous as the first, soon after crossed the river.""[22] [Note 22: Lewis and Clark's Exped., II, p. 395.] Perhaps the most vivid picture ever afforded of the former abundance of buffalo is that given by Col. R. I. Dodge in his ""Plains of the Great West,"" p. 120, _et seq._ It is well worth reproducing entire: ""In May, 1871, I drove in a light wagon from Old Fort Zara to Fort Larned, on the Arkansas, 34 miles. At least 25 miles of this distance was through one immense herd, composed of countless smaller herds of buffalo then on their journey north. The road ran along the broad level 'bottom,' or valley, of the river. * * * ""The whole country appeared one great mass of buffalo, moving slowly to the northward; and it was only when actually among them that it could be ascertained that the apparently solid mass was an agglomeration of innumerable small herds, of from fifty to two hundred animals, separated from the surrounding herds by greater or less space, but still separated. The herds in the valley sullenly got out of my way, and, turning, stared stupidly at me, sometimes at only a few yards' distance. When I had reached a point where the hills were no longer more than a mile from the road, the buffalo on the hills, seeing an unusual object in their rear, turned, stared an instant, then started at full speed directly towards me, stampeding and bringing with them the numberless herds through which they passed, and pouring down upon me all the herds, no longer separated, but one immense compact mass of plunging animals, mad with fright, and as irresistible as an avalanche. ""The situation was by no means pleasant. Reining up my horse (which was fortunately a quiet old beast that had been in at the death of many a buffalo, so that their wildest, maddest rush only caused him to cock his ears in wonder at their unnecessary excitement), I waited until the front of the mass was within 50 yards, when a few well-directed shots from my rifle split the herd, and sent it pouring off in two streams to my right and left. When all had passed me they stopped, apparently perfectly satisfied, though thousands were yet within reach of my rifle and many within less than 100 yards. Disdaining to fire again, I sent my servant to cut out the tongues of the fallen. This occurred so frequently within the next 10 miles, that when I arrived at Fort Larned I had twenty-six tongues in my wagon, representing the greatest number of buffalo that my conscience can reproach me for having murdered on any single day. I was not hunting, wanted no meat, and would not voluntarily have fired at these herds. I killed only in self-preservation and fired almost every shot from the wagon."" At my request Colonel Dodge has kindly furnished me a careful estimate upon which to base a calculation of the number of buffaloes in that great herd, and the result is very interesting. In a private letter, dated September 21, 1887, he writes as follows: ""The great herd on the Arkansas through which I passed could not have averaged, _at rest_, over fifteen or twenty individuals to the acre, but was, from my own observation, not less than 25 miles wide, and from reports of hunters and others it was about five days in passing a given point, or not less than 50 miles deep. From the top of Pawnee Rock I could see from 6 to 10 miles in almost every direction. This whole vast space was covered with buffalo, looking at a distance like one compact mass, the visual angle not permitting the ground to be seen. I have seen such a sight a great number of times, but never on so large a scale. ""That was the last of the great herds."" With these figures before us, it is not difficult to make a calculation that will be somewhere near the truth of the number of buffaloes actually seen in one day by Colonel Dodge on the Arkansas River during that memorable drive, and also of the number of head in the entire herd. According to his recorded observation, the herd extended along the river for a distance of 25 miles, which was in reality the width of the vast procession that was moving north, and back from the road as far as the eye could reach, on both sides. It is making a low estimate to consider the extent of the visible ground at 1 mile on either side. This gives a strip of country 2 miles wide by 25 long, or a total of 50 square miles covered with buffalo, averaging from fifteen to twenty to the acre.[23] Taking the lesser number, in order to be below the truth rather than above it, we find that the number actually seen on that day by Colonel Dodge was in the neighborhood of 480,000, not counting the additional number taken in at the view from the top of Pawnee Rock, which, if added, would easily bring the total up to a round half million! [Note 23: On the plains of Dakota, the Rev. Mr. Belcourt (Schoolcraft's N. A. Indians, IV, p. 108) once counted two hundred and twenty-eight buffaloes, a part of a great herd, feeding on a single acre of ground. This of course was an unusual occurrence with buffaloes not stampeding, but practically at rest. It is quite possible also that the extent of the ground may have been underestimated.] If the advancing multitude had been at all points 50 miles in length (as it was known to have been in some places at least) by 25 miles in width, and still averaged fifteen head to the acre of ground, it would have contained the enormous number of 12,000,000 head. But, judging from the general principles governing such migrations, it is almost certain that the moving mass advanced in the shape of a wedge, which would make it necessary to deduct about two-third from the grand total, which would leave 4,000,000 as our estimate of the actual number of buffaloes in this great herd, which I believe is more likely to be below the truth than above it. No wonder that the men of the West of those days, both white and red, thought it would be impossible to exterminate such a mighty multitude. The Indians of some tribes believed that the buffaloes issued from the earth continually, and that the supply was necessarily inexhaustible. And yet, in four short years the southern herd was almost totally annihilated. With such a lesson before our eyes, confirmed in every detail by living testimony, who will dare to say that there will be an elk, moose, caribou, mountain sheep, mountain goat, antelope, or black-tail deer left alive in the United States in a wild state fifty years from this date, ay, or even twenty-five? Mr. William Blackmore contributes the following testimony to the abundance of buffalo in Kansas:[24] [Note 24: Plains of the Great West, p. xvi.] ""In the autumn of 1868, whilst crossing the plains on the Kansas Pacific Railroad, for a distance of upwards of 120 miles, between Ellsworth and Sheridan, we passed through an almost unbroken herd of buffalo. The plains were blackened with them, and more than once the train had to stop to allow unusually large herds to pass. * * * In 1872, whilst on a scout for about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge to the Indian Territory, we were never out of sight of buffalo."" Twenty years hence, when not even a bone or a buffalo-chip remains above ground throughout the West to mark the presence of the buffalo, it may be difficult for people to believe that these animals ever existed in such numbers as to constitute not only a serious annoyance, but very often a dangerous menace to wagon travel across the plains, and also to stop railway trains, and even throw them off the track. The like has probably never occurred before in any country, and most assuredly never will again, if the present rate of large game destruction all over the world can be taken as a foreshadowing of the future. In this connection the following additional testimony from Colonel Dodge (""Plains of the Great West,"" p. 121) is of interest: ""The Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad was then [in 1871-'72] in process of construction, and nowhere could the peculiarity of the buffalo of which I am speaking be better studied than from its trains. If a herd was on the north side of the track, it would stand stupidly gazing, and without a symptom of alarm, although the locomotive passed within a hundred yards. If on the south side of the track, even though at a distance of 1 or 2 miles from it, the passage of a train set the whole herd in the wildest commotion. At full speed, and utterly regardless of the consequences, it would make for the track on its line of retreat. If the train happened not to be in its path, it crossed the track and stopped satisfied. If the train was in its way, each individual buffalo went at it with the desperation of despair, plunging against or between locomotive and cars, just as its blind madness chanced to direct it. Numbers were killed, but numbers still pressed on, to stop and stare as soon as the obstacle had passed. After having trains thrown off the track twice in one week, conductors learned to have a very decided respect for the idiosyncrasies of the buffalo, and when there was a possibility of striking a herd 'on the rampage' for the north side of the track, the train was slowed up and sometimes stopped entirely."" The accompanying illustration, reproduced from the ""Plains of the Great West,"" by the kind permission of the author, is, in one sense, ocular proof that collisions between railway trains and vast herds of buffaloes were so numerous that they formed a proper subject for illustration. In regard to the stoppage of trains and derailment of locomotives by buffaloes, Colonel Dodge makes the following allusion in the private letter already referred to: ""There are at least a hundred reliable railroad men now employed on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad who were witnesses of, and sometimes sufferers from, the wild rushes of buffalo as described on page 121 of my book. I was at the time stationed at Fort Dodge, and I was personally cognizant of several of these 'accidents.'"" [Illustration: SLAUGHTER OF BUFFALO ON THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD. Reproduced from ""The Plains of the Great West,"" by permission of the author, Col. R. I. Dodge.] The following, from the ever pleasing pen of Mr. Catlin, is of decided interest in this connection: ""In one instance, near the mouth of White River, we met the most immense herd crossing the Missouri River [in Dakota], and from an imprudence got our boat into imminent danger amongst them, from which we were highly delighted to make our escape. It was in the midst of the 'running season,' and we had heard the 'roaring' (as it is called) of the herd when we were several miles from them. When we came in sight, we were actually terrified at the immense numbers that were streaming down the green hills on one side of the river, and galloping up and over the bluffs on the other. The river was filled, and in parts blackened with their heads and horns, as they were swimming about, following up their objects, and making desperate battle whilst they were swimming. I deemed it imprudent for our canoe to be dodging amongst them, and ran it ashore for a few hours, where we laid, waiting for the opportunity of seeing the river clear, but we waited in vain. Their numbers, however, got somewhat diminished at last, and we pushed off, and successfully made our way amongst them. From the immense numbers that had passed the river at that place, they had torn down the prairie bank of 15 feet in height, so as to form a sort of road or landing place, where they all in succession clambered up. Many in their turmoil had been wafted below this landing, and unable to regain it against the swiftness of the current, had fastened themselves along in crowds, hugging close to the high bank under which they were standing. As we were drifting by these, and supposing ourselves out of danger, I drew up my rifle and shot one of them in the head, which tumbled into the water, and brought with him a hundred others, which plunged in, and in a moment were swimming about our canoe, and placing it in great danger. No attack was made upon us, and in the confusion the poor beasts knew not, perhaps, the enemy that was amongst them; but we were liable to be sunk by them, as they were furiously hooking and climbing on to each other. I rose in my canoe, and by my gestures and hallooing kept them from coming in contact with us until we were out of their reach.""[25] [Note 25: Catlin's North American Indians, II, p. 13.] IV. CHARACTER OF THE SPECIES. 1. _The buffaloes rank amongst ruminants._--With the American people, and through them all others, familiarity with the buffalo has bred contempt. The incredible numbers in which the animals of this species formerly existed made their slaughter an easy matter, so much so that the hunters and frontiersmen who accomplished their destruction have handed down to us a contemptuous opinion of the size, character, and general presence of our bison. And how could it be otherwise than that a man who could find it in his heart to murder a majestic bull bison for a hide worth only a dollar should form a one-dollar estimate of the grandest ruminant that ever trod the earth? Men who butcher African elephants for the sake of their ivory also entertain a similar estimate of their victims. With an acquaintance which includes fine living examples of all the larger ruminants of the world except the musk-ox and the European bison, I am sure that the American bison is the grandest of them all. His only rivals for the kingship are the Indian bison, or gaur (_Bos gaurus_), of Southern India, and the aurochs, or European bison, both of which really surpass him in height, if not in actual balk also. The aurochs is taller, and possesses a larger pelvis and heavier, stronger hindquarters, but his body is decidedly smaller in all its proportions, which gives him a lean and ""leggy"" look. The hair on the head, neck, and forequarters of the aurochs is not nearly so long or luxuriant as on the same parts of the American bison. This covering greatly magnifies the actual bulk of the latter animal. Clothe the aurochs with the wonderful pelage of our buffalo, give him the same enormous chest and body, and the result would be a magnificent bovine monster, who would indeed stand without a rival. But when first-class types of the two species are placed side by side it seems to me that _Bison americanus_ will easily rank his European rival. The gaur has no long hair upon any part of his body or head. What little hair he has is very short and thin, his hindquarters being almost naked. I have seen hundreds of these animals at short range, and have killed and skinned several very fine specimens, one of which stood 5 feet 10 inches in height at the shoulders. But, despite his larger bulk, his appearance is not nearly so striking and impressive as that of the male American bison. He seems like a huge ox running wild. The magnificent dark brown frontlet and beard of the buffalo, the shaggy coat of hair upon the neck, hump, and shoulders, terminating at the knees in a thick mass of luxuriant black locks, to say nothing of the dense coat of finer fur on the body and hindquarters, give to our species not only an apparent height equal to that of the gaur, but a grandeur and nobility of presence which are beyond all comparison amongst ruminants. The slightly larger bulk of the gaur is of little significance in a comparison of the two species; for if size alone is to turn the scale, we must admit that a 500-pound lioness, with no mane whatever, is a more majestic looking animal than a 450-pound lion, with a mane which has earned him his title of king of beasts. 2. _Change of form in captivity._--By a combination of unfortunate circumstances, the American bison is destined to go down to posterity shorn of the honor which is his due, and appreciated at only half his worth. The hunters who slew him were from the very beginning so absorbed in the scramble for spoils that they had no time to measure or weigh him, nor even to notice the majesty of his personal appearance on his native heath. In captivity he fails to develop as finely as in his wild state, and with the loss of his liberty he becomes a tame-looking animal. He gets fat and short-bodied, and the lack of vigorous and constant exercise prevents the development of bone and muscle which made the prairie animal what he was. From observations made upon buffaloes that have been reared in captivity, I am firmly convinced that confinement and semi-domestication are destined to effect striking changes in the form of _Bison americanus_. While this is to be expected to a certain extent with most large species, the changes promise to be most conspicuous in the buffalo. The most striking change is in the body between the hips and the shoulders. As before remarked, it becomes astonishingly short and rotund, and through liberal feeding and total lack of exercise the muscles of the shoulders and hindquarters, especially the latter, are but feebly developed. The most striking example of the change of form in the captive buffalo is the cow in the Central Park Menagerie, New York. Although this animal is fully adult, and has given birth to three fine calves, she is small, astonishingly short-bodied, and in comparison with the magnificently developed cows taken in 1886 by the writer in Montana, she seems almost like an animal of another species. Both the live buffaloes in the National Museum collection of living animals are developing the same shortness of body and lack of muscle, and when they attain their full growth will but poorly resemble the splendid proportions of the wild specimens in the Museum mounted group, each of which has been mounted from a most careful and elaborate series of post-mortem measurements. It may fairly be considered, however, that the specimens taken by the Smithsonian expedition were in every way more perfect representatives of the species than have been usually taken in times past, for the simple reason that on account of the muscle they had developed in the numerous chases they had survived, and the total absence of the fat which once formed such a prominent feature of the animal, they were of finer form, more active habit, and keener intelligence than buffaloes possessed when they were so numerous. Out of the millions which once composed the great northern herd, those represented the survival of the fittest, and their existence at that time was chiefly due to the keenness of their senses and their splendid muscular powers in speed and endurance. Under such conditions it is only natural that animals of the highest class should be developed. On the other hand, captivity reverses all these conditions, while yielding an equally abundant food supply. In no feature is the change from natural conditions to captivity more easily noticeable than in the eye. In the wild buffalo the eye is always deeply set, well protected by the edge of the bony orbit, and perfect in form and expression. The lids are firmly drawn around the ball, the opening is so small that the white portion of the eyeball is entirely covered, and the whole form and appearance of the organ is as shapely and as pleasing in expression as the eye of a deer. In the captive the various muscles which support and control the eyeball seem to relax and thicken, and the ball protrudes far beyond its normal plane, showing a circle of white all around the iris, and bulging out in a most unnatural way. I do not mean to assert that this is common in captive buffaloes generally, but I have observed it to be disagreeably conspicuous in many. Another change which takes place in the form of the captive buffalo is an arching of the back in the middle, which has a tendency to make the hump look lower at the shoulders and visibly alters the outline of the back. This tendency to ""hump up"" the back is very noticeable in domestic cattle and horses during rainy weather. While a buffalo on his native heath would seldom assume such an attitude of dejection and misery, in captivity, especially if it be anything like close confinement, it is often to be observed, and I fear will eventually become a permanent habit. Indeed, I think it may be confidently predicted that the time will come when naturalists who have never seen a wild buffalo will compare the specimens composing the National Museum group with the living representatives to be seen in captivity and assert that the former are exaggerations in both form and size. 3. _Mounted Specimens in Museums._--Of the ""stuffed"" specimens to be found in museums, all that I have ever seen outside of the National Museum and even those within that institution up to 1886, were ""stuffed"" in reality as well as in name. The skins that have been rammed full of straw or excelsior have lost from 8 to 12 inches in height at the shoulders, and the high and sharp hump of the male has become a huge, thick, rounded mass like the hump of a dromedary, and totally unlike the hump of a bison. It is impossible for any taxidermist to stuff a buffalo-skin with loose materials and produce a specimen which fitly represents the species. The proper height and form of the animal can be secured and retained only by the construction of a manikin, or statue, to carry the skin. In view of this fact, which surely must be apparent to even the most casual observer, it is to be earnestly hoped that here no one in authority will ever consent to mount or have mounted a valuable skin of a bison in any other way than over a properly constructed manikin. 4. _The Calf._--The breeding season of the buffalo is from the 1st of July to the 1st of October. The young cow does not breed until she is three years old, and although two calves are sometimes produced at a birth, one is the usual number. The calves are born in April, May, and June, and sometimes, though rarely, as late as the middle of August. The calf follows its mother until it is a year old, or even older. In May, 1886, the Smithsonian expedition captured a calf alive, which had been abandoned by its mother because it could not keep up with her. The little creature was apparently between two and three weeks old, and was therefore born about May 1. Unlike the young of nearly all other _BovidÃ¦_, the buffalo calf during the first months of its existence is clad with hair of a totally different color from that which covers him during the remainder of his life. His pelage is a luxuriant growth of rather long, wavy hair, of a uniform brownish-yellow or ""sandy"" color (cinnamon, or yellow ocher, with a shade of Indian yellow) all over the head, body, and tail, in striking contrast with the darker colors of the older animals. On the lower half of the leg it is lighter, shorter, and straight. On the shoulders and hump the hair is longer than on the other portions, being 11/2 inches in length, more wavy, and already arranges itself in the tufts, or small bunches, so characteristic in the adult animal. On the extremity of the muzzle, including the chin, the hair is very short, straight, and as light in color as the lower portions of the leg. Starting on the top of the nose, an inch behind the nostrils, and forming a division between the light yellowish muzzle and the more reddish hair on the remainder of the head, there is an irregular band of dark, straight hair, which extends down past the corner of the mouth to a point just back of the chin, where it unites. From the chin backward the dark band increases in breadth and intensity, and continues back half way to the angle of the jaw. At that point begins a sort of under mane of wavy, dark-brown hair, nearly 3 inches long, and extends back along the median line of the throat to a point between the fore legs, where it abruptly terminates. From the back of the head another streak of dark hair extends backward along the top of the neck, over the hump, and down to the lumbar region, where it fades out entirely. These two dark bands are in sharp contrast to the light sandy hair adjoining. The tail is densely haired. The tuft on the end is quite luxuriant, and shows a center of darker hair. The hair on the inside of the ear is dark, but that on the outside is sandy. The naked portion of the nose is light Vandyke-brown, with a pinkish tinge, and the edge of the eyelid the same. The iris is dark brown. The horn at three months is about 1 inch in length, and is a mere little black stub. In the male, the hump is clearly defined, but by no means so high in proportion as in the adult animal. The hump of the calf from which this description is drawn is of about the same relative angle and height as that of an adult cow buffalo. The specimen itself is well represented in the accompanying plate. The measurements of this specimen in the flesh were as follows: +---------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. (Male; four months old.) | +---------------------------------------------------------+ | (_No. 15503, National Museum collection._) | +---------------------------------------------------------+ | |Feet.|Inches.| |Height at shoulders | 2 | 8 | |Length, head and body to insertion of tail | 3 | 101/2 | |Depth of chest | 1 | 4 | |Depth of flank | | 10 | |Girth behind fore leg | 3 | 1/2 | |From base of horns around end of nose | 1 | 71/2 | |Length of tail vertebrÃ¦ | | 7 | +---------------------------------------------------------+ The calves begin to shed their coat of red hair about the beginning of August. The first signs of the change, however, appear about a month earlier than that, in the darkening of the mane under the throat, and also on the top of the neck.[26] [Note 26: Our captive had, in some way, bruised the skin on his forehead, and in June all the hair came off the top of his head, leaving it quite bald. We kept the skin well greased with porpoise oil, and by the middle of July a fine coat of black hair had grown out all over the surface that had previously been bare.] By the 1st of August the red hair on the body begins to fall off in small patches, and the growth of fine, new, dark hair seems to actually crowd off the old. As is the case with the adult animals, the shortest hair is the first to be shed, but the change of coat takes place in about half the time that it occupies in the older animals. By the 1st of October the transformation is complete, and not even a patch of the old red hair remains upon the new suit of brown. This is far from being the case with the old bulls and cows, for even up to the last week in October we found them with an occasional patch of the old hair still clinging to the new, on the back or shoulders. Like most young animals, the calf of the buffalo is very easily tamed, especially if taken when only a few weeks old. The one captured in Montana by the writer, resisted at first as stoutly as it was able, by butting with its head, but after we had tied its legs together and carried it to camp, across a horse, it made up its mind to yield gracefully to the inevitable, and from that moment became perfectly docile. It very soon learned to drink milk in the most satisfactory manner, and adapted itself to its new surroundings quite as readily as any domestic calf would have done. Its only cry was a low-pitched, pig-like grunt through the nose, which was uttered only when hungry or thirsty. I have been told by old frontiersmen and buffalo-hunters that it used to be a common practice for a hunter who had captured a young calf to make it follow him by placing one of his fingers in its mouth, and allowing the calf to suck at it for a moment. Often a calf has been induced in this way to follow a horseman for miles, and eventually to join his camp outfit. It is said that the same result has been accomplished with calves by breathing a few times into their nostrils. In this connection Mr. Catlin's observations on the habits of buffalo calves are most interesting. ""In pursuing a large herd of buffaloes at the season when their calves are but a few weeks old, I have often been exceedingly amused with the curious maneuvers of these shy little things. Amidst the thundering confusion of a throng of several hundreds or several thousands of these animals, there will be many of the calves that lose sight of their dams; and being left behind by the throng, and the swift-passing hunters, they endeavor to secrete themselves, when they are exceedingly put to it on a level prairie, where naught can be seen but the short grass of 6 or 8 inches in height, save an occasional bunch of wild sage a few inches higher, to which the poor affrighted things will run, and dropping on their knees, will push their noses under it and into the grass, where they will stand for hours, with their eyes shut, imagining themselves securely hid, whilst they are standing up quite straight upon their hind feet, and can easily be seen at several miles distance. It is a familiar amusement with us, accustomed to these scenes, to retreat back over the ground where we have just escorted the herd, and approach these little trembling things, which stubbornly maintain their positions, with their noses pushed under the grass and their eyes strained upon us, us we dismount from our horses and are passing around them. From this fixed position they are sure not to move until hands are laid upon them, and then for the shins of a novice we can extend our sympathy; or if he can preserve the skin on his bones from the furious buttings of its head, we know how to congratulate him on his signal success and good luck. [Illustration: From photograph of group in National Museum. Engraved by R. H. Carson. BUFFALO COW, CALF (FOUR MONTHS OLD), AND YEARLING. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] ""In these desperate struggles for a moment, the little thing is conquered, and makes no further resistance. And I have often, in concurrence with a known custom of the country, held my hands over the eyes of the calf and breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils, after which I have, with my hunting companions, rode several miles into our encampment with the little prisoner busily following the heels of my horse the whole way, as closely and as affectionately as its instinct would attach it to the company of its dam. ""This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with in the habits of this wild country, and although I had often heard of it, and felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to bear testimony to the fact from the numerous instances which I have witnessed since I came into the country. During the time that I resided at this post [mouth of the TetÃ³n River] in the spring of the year, on my way up the river, I assisted (in numerous hunts of the buffalo with the fur company's men) in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these little prisoners, which sometimes followed for 5 or 6 miles close to our horse's heels, and even into the fur company's fort, and into the stable where our horses were led. In this way, before I left the headwaters of the Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen, which Mr. Laidlaw was successfully raising with the aid of a good milch cow.""[27] [Note 27: North American Indians, I, 255.] It must be remembered, however, that such cases as the above were exceptional, even with the very young calves, which alone exhibited the trait described. Such instances occurred only when buffaloes existed in such countless numbers that man's presence and influence had not affected the character of the animal in the least. No such instances of innocent stupidity will ever be displayed again, even by the youngest calf. The war of extermination, and the struggle for life and security have instilled into the calf, even from its birth, a mortal fear of both men and horses, and the instinct to fly for life. The calf captured by our party was not able to run, but in the most absurd manner it butted our horses as soon as they came near enough, and when Private Moran attempted to lay hold of the little fellow it turned upon him, struck him in the stomach with its head, and sent him sprawling into the sage-brush. If it had only possessed the strength, it would have led us a lively chase. During 1886 four other buffalo calves were either killed or caught by the cowboys on the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, in the Dry Creek region. All of them ran the moment they discovered their enemies. Two were shot and killed. One was caught by a cowboy named Horace Brodhurst, ear marked, and turned loose. The fifth one was caught in September on the Porcupine Creek round-up. He was then about five months old, and being abundantly able to travel he showed a clean pair of heels. It took three fresh horses, one after another, to catch him, and his final capture was due to exhaustion, and not to the speed of any of his pursuers. The distance covered by the chase, from the point where his first pursuer started to where the third one finally lassoed him, was considered to be at least 15 miles. But the capture came to naught, for on the following day the calf died from overexertion and want of milk. Colonel Dodge states that the very young calves of a herd have to depend upon the old bulls for protection, and seldom in vain. The mothers abandon their offspring on slight provocation, and even none at all sometimes, if we may judge from the condition of the little waif that fell into our hands. Had its mother remained with it, or even in its neighborhood, we should at least have seen her, but she was nowhere within a radius of 5 miles at the time her calf was discovered. Nor did she return to look for it, as two of us proved by spending the night in the sage-brush at the very spot where the calf was taken. Colonel Dodge declares that ""the cow seems to possess scarcely a trace of maternal instinct, and, when frightened, will abandon and run away from her calf without the slightest hesitation. * * * When the calves are young they are always kept in the center of each small herd, while the bulls dispose themselves on the outside.""[28] [Note 28: Plains of the Great West, pp. 124, 125.] Apparently the maternal instinct of the cow buffalo was easily mastered by fear. That it was often manifested, however, is proven by the following from Audubon and Bachman:[29] [Note 29: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, pp. 38, 39.] ""Buffalo calves are drowned from being unable to ascend the steep banks of the rivers across which they have just swam, as the cows cannot help them, although they stand near the bank, and will not leave them to their fate unless something alarms them. ""On one occasion Mr. Kipp, of the American Fur Company, caught eleven calves, their dams all the time standing near the top of the bank. Frequently, however, the cows leave the young to their fate, when most of them perish. In connection with this part of the subject, we may add that we were informed, when on the Upper Missouri River, that when the banks of that river were practicable for cows, and their calves could not follow them, they went down again, after having gained the top, and would remain by them until forced away by the cravings of hunger. When thus forced by the necessity of saving themselves to quit their young, they seldom, if ever, return to them. When a large herd of these wild animals are crossing a river, the calves or yearlings manage to get on the backs of the cows, and are thus conveyed safely over."" 5. _The Yearling._--During the first five months of his life, the calf changes its coat completely, and becomes in appearance a totally different animal. By the time he is six months old he has taken on all the colors which distinguish him in after life, excepting that upon his fore quarters. The hair on the head has started out to attain the luxuriant length and density which is so conspicuous in the adult, and its general color is a rich dark brown, shading to black under the chin and throat. The fringe under the neck is long, straight, and black, and the under parts, the back of the fore arm, the outside of thigh, and the tail-tuft are all black. The color of the shoulder, the side, and upper part of the hind quarter is a peculiar smoky brown (""broccoli brown"" of Ridgway), having in connection with the darker browns of the other parts a peculiar faded appearance, quite as if it were due to the bleaching power of the sun. On the fore quarters there is none of the bright straw color so characteristic of the adult animal. Along the top of the neck and shoulders, however, this color has at last begun to show faintly. The hair on the body is quite luxuriant, both in length and density, in both respects quite equaling, if not even surpassing, that of the finest adults. For example, the hair on the side of the mounted yearling in the Museum group has a length of 2 to 21/2 inches, while that on the same region of the adult bull, whose pelage is particularly fine, is recorded as being 2 inches only. The horn is a straight, conical spike from 4 to 6 inches long, according to age, and perfectly black. The legs are proportionally longer and larger in the joints than those of the full-grown animal. The countenance of the yearling is quite interesting. The sleepy, helpless, innocent expression of the very young calf has given place to a wide-awake, mischievous look, and he seems ready to break away and run at a second's notice. The measurements of the yearling in the Museum group are as follows: +----------------------------------------------------------------+ |BISON AMERICANUS. (Male yearling, taken Oct. 31, 1886.

The curve of the horn is generally hidden in the hair, and the only part visible is the straight, terminal spike. Usually the spike points diverge from each other, but often they are parallel, and also perpendicular. In the fourth year, however, the points of the horns begin to curve inward toward each other, describing equal arcs of the same circle, as if they were going to meet over the top of the head. In the handsome young ""spike"" bull in the Museum group, the hair on the shoulders has begun to take on the length, the light color, and tufted appearance of the adult, beginning at the highest point of the hump and gradually spreading. Immediately back of this light patch the hair is long, but dark and woolly in appearance. The leg tufts have doubled in length, and reveal the character of the growth that may be finally expected. The beard has greatly lengthened, as also has the hair upon the bridge of the nose, the forehead, ears, jaws, and all other portions of the head except the cheeks. The ""spike"" period of a buffalo is a most interesting one. Like a seventeen-year-old boy, the young bull shows his youth in so many ways it is always conspicuous, and his countenance is so suggestive of a half-bearded youth it fixes the interest to a marked degree. He is active, alert, and suspicious, and when he makes up his mind to run the hunter may as well give up the chase. By a strange fatality, our spike bull appears to be the only one in any museum, or even in preserved existence, as far as can be ascertained. Out of the twenty-five buffaloes killed and preserved by the Smithsonian expedition, ten of which were adult bulls, this specimen was the only male between the yearling and the adult ages. An effort to procure another entire specimen of this age from Texas yielded only two spike heads. It is to be sincerely regretted that more specimens representing this very interesting period of the buffalo's life have not been preserved, for it is now too late to procure wild specimens. The following are the post-mortem dimensions of our specimen: +---------------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | +---------------------------------------------------------------+ |(""Spike"" bull, two years old; taken October 14, 1886.

But the head is irresistible in its claims to precedence. [Illustration: SPIKE BULL. From the group in the National Museum. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] It must be observed at this point that in many respects this animal is an exceptionally fine one. In actual size of frame, and in quantity and quality of pelage, it is far superior to the average, even of wild buffaloes when they were most numerous and at their best.[30] In one respect, however, that of actual bulk, it is believed that this specimen may have often been surpassed. When buffaloes were numerous, and not required to do any great amount of running in order to exist, they were, in the autumn months, very fat. Audubon says: ""A large bison bull will generally weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, and a fat cow about 1,200 pounds. We weighed one of the bulls killed by our party, and found it to reach 1,727 pounds, although it had already lost a good deal of blood. This was an old bull, and not fat. It had probably weighed more at some previous period.""[31] Our specimen when killed (by the writer, December 6, 1886) was in full vigor, superbly muscled, and well fed, but he carried not a single pound of fat. For years the never-ceasing race for life had utterly prevented the secretion of useless and cumbersome fat, and his ""subsistence"" had gone toward the development of useful muscle. Having no means by which to weigh him, we could only estimate his weight, in which I called for the advice of my cowboys, all of whom were more or less familiar with the weight of range cattle, and one I regarded as an expert. At first the estimated weight of the animal was fixed at 1,700 pounds, but with a constitutional fear of estimating over the truth, I afterward reduced it to 1,600 pounds. This I am now well convinced was an error, for I believe the first figure to have been nearer the truth. [Note 30: In testimony whereof the following extract from a letter written by General Stewart Van Vliet, on March 10, 1897, to Professor Baird, is of interest: ""MY DEAR PROFESSOR: On the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I saw General Sheridan, and yesterday we called on your taxidermist and examined the buffalo bull he is setting up for the Museum. I don't think I have ever seen a more splendid specimen in my life. General Sheridan and I have seen millions of buffalo on the plains in former times. I have killed hundreds, but I never killed a larger animal than the one in the possession of your taxidermist.""] [Note 31: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, p. 44.] In mounting the skin of this animal, we endeavored by every means in our power, foremost of which were three different sets of measurements, taken from the dead animal, one set to check another, to reproduce him when mounted in exactly the same form he possessed in life--muscular, but not fat. The color of the body and hindquarters of a buffalo is very peculiar, and almost baffles intelligent description. Audubon calls it ""between a dark umber and liver-shining brown."" I once saw a competent artist experiment with his oil-colors for a quarter of an hour before he finally struck the combination which exactly matched the side of our large bull. To my eyes, the color is a pale gray-brown or smoky gray. The range of individual variation is considerable, some being uniformly darker than the average type, and others lighter. While the under parts of most adults are dark brown or blackish brown, others are actually black. The hair on the body and hinder parts is fine, wavy on the outside, and woolly underneath, and very dense. Add to this the thickness of the skin itself, and the combination forms a covering that is almost impervious to cold. The entire fore quarter region, _e. g._, the shoulders, the hump, and the upper part of the neck, is covered with a luxuriant growth of pale yellow hair (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which stands straight out in a dense mass, disposed in handsome tufts. The hair is somewhat woolly in its nature, and the ends are as even as if the whole mass had lately been gone over with shears and carefully clipped. This hair is 4 inches in length. As the living animal moved his head from side to side, the hair parted in great vertical furrows, so deep that the skin itself seemed almost in sight. As before remarked, to comb this hair would utterly destroy its naturalness, and it should never be done under any circumstances. Standing as it does between the darker hair of the body on one side and the almost black mass of the head on the other, this light area is rendered doubly striking and conspicuous by contrast. It not only covers the shoulders, but extends back upon the thorax, where it abruptly terminates on a line corresponding to the sixth rib. From the shoulder-joint downward, the color shades gradually into a dark brown until at the knee it becomes quite black. The huge fore-arm is lost in a thick mass of long, coarse, and rather straight hair 10 inches in length. This growth stops abruptly at the knee, but it hangs within 6 inches of the hoof. The front side of this mass is blackish brown, but it rapidly shades backward and downward into jet-black. The hair on the top of the head lies in a dense, matted mass, forming a perfect crown of rich brown (burnt sienna) locks, 16 inches in length, hanging over the eyes, almost enveloping both horns, and spreading back in rich, dark masses upon the light-colored neck. On the cheeks the hair is of the same blackish brown color, but comparatively short, and lies in beautiful waves. On the bridge of the nose the hair is about 6 inches in length and stands out in a thick, uniform, very curly mass, which always looks as if it had just been carefully combed. Immediately around the nose and mouth the hair is very short, straight and stiff, and lies close to the skin, which leaves the nostrils and lips fully exposed. The front part of the chin is similarly clad, and its form is perfectly flat, due to the habit of the animal in feeding upon the short, crisp buffalo grass, in the course of which the chin is pressed flat against the ground. The end of the muzzle is very massive, measuring 2 feet 2 inches in circumference just back of the nostrils. The hair of the chin-beard is coarse, perfectly straight, jet black, and 111/2 inches in length on our old bull. Occasionally a bull is met with who is a genuine Esau amongst his kind. I once saw a bull, of medium size but fully adult, whose hair was a wonder to behold. I have now in my possession a small lock of hair which I plucked from his forehead, and its length is 221/2 inches. His horns were entirely concealed by the immense mass of long hair that nature had piled upon his head, and his beard was as luxuriant as his frontlet. [Illustration: BULL BUFFALO IN NATIONAL MUSEUM GROUP. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] The nostril opening is large and wide. The color of the hairless portions of the nose and mouth is shiny Vandyke brown and black, with a strong tinge of bluish-purple, but this latter tint is not noticeable save upon close examination, and the eyelid is the same. The iris is of an irregular pear-shaped outline, 1-5/16 inches in its longest diameter, very dark, reddish brown in color, with a black edging all around it. Ordinarily no portion of the white eyeball is visible, but the broad black band surrounding the iris, and a corner patch of white, is frequently shown by the turning of the eye. The tongue is bluish purple, as are the lips inside. The hoofs and horns are, in reality, jet black throughout, but the horn often has at the base a scaly, dead appearance on the outside, and as the wrinkles around the base increase with age and scale up and gather dirt, that part looks gray. The horns of bulls taken in their prime are smooth, glossy black, and even look as if they had been half polished with oil. As the bull increases in age, the outer layers of the horn begin to break off at the tip and pile up one upon another, until the horn has become a thick, blunt stub, with only the tip of what was once a neat and shapely point showing at the end. The bull is then known as a ""stub-horn,"" and his horns increase in roughness and unsightliness as he grows older. From long rubbing on the earth, the outer curve of each horn is gradually worn flat, which still further mars its symmetry. The horns serve as a fair index of the age of a bison. After he is three years old, the bison adds each year a ring around the base of his horns, the same as domestic cattle. If we may judge by this, the horn begins to break when the bison is about ten or eleven years old, and the stubbing process gradually continues during the rest of his life. Judging by the teeth, and also the oldest horns I have seen, I am of the opinion that the natural life time of the bison is about twenty-five years; certainly no less. +--------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | | (Male, eleven years old. | | Taken December 6, 1866.

The hair on the shoulders has begun to take on the light straw-color, and has by this time attained a length which causes it to arrange itself in tufts, or locks. The body colors have grown darker, and reached their permanent tone. Of course the hair on the head has by no means attained its full length, and the head is not at all handsome. The horns are quite small, but the curve is well defined, and they distinctly mark the sex of the individual, even at the beginning of the third year. +------------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | |(Young cow, in third year.

The hair on the lower joints of the leg is in turn lighter, being about the same shade as that on the loins. The fore-arm is concealed in a mass of almost black hair, which gradually shades lighter from the elbow upward and along the whole region of the humerus. On the shoulder itself the hair is pale yellow or straw-color (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which extends down in a point toward the elbow. From the back of the head a conspicuous baud of curly, dark-brown hair extends back like a mane along the neck and to the top of the hump, beyond which it soon fades out. The hair on the head is everywhere a rich burnt-sienna brown, except around the corners of the mouth, where it shades into black. The horns of the cow bison are slender, but solid for about two-thirds of their length from the tip, ringed with age near their base, and quite black. Very often they are imperfect in shape, and out of every five pairs at least one is generally misshapen. Usually one horn is ""crumpled,"" _e. g._, dwarfed in length and unnaturally thickened at the base, and very often one horn is found to be merely an unsightly, misshapen stub. [Illustration: From a photograph. Engraved by Frederick Juengling. BULL BUFFALO. (REAR VIEW.) Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] The udder of the cow bison is very small, as might be expected of an animal which must do a great deal of hard traveling, but the milk is said to be very rich. Some authorities declare that it requires the milk of two domestic cows to satisfy one buffalo calf, but this, I think, is an error. Our calf began in May to consume 6 quarts of domestic milk daily, which by June 10 had increased to 8, and up to July 10, 9 quarts was the utmost it could drink. By that time it began to eat grass, but the quantity of milk disposed of remained about the same. +---------------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | |(Adult cow, eight years old.

While most Rocky Mountain hunters consider the bison of the mountains quite distinct from that of the plains, it must be remarked that no two authorities quite agree in regard to the distinguishing characters of the variety they recognize. Colonel Dodge states that ""His body is lighter, whilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incredible in such a huge and unwieldy beast.""[32] [Note 32: Plains of the Great West, p. 144.] The belief in the existence of a distinct mountain variety is quite common amongst hunters and frontiersmen all along the eastern slope the Rocky Mountains as far north as the Peace River. In this connection the following from Professor Henry Youle Hind[33] is of general interest: [Note 33: Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, II p. 104-105.] ""The existence of two kinds of buffalo is firmly believed by many hunters at Red River; they are stated to be the prairie buffalo and the buffalo of the woods. Many old hunters with whom I have conversed on this subject aver that the so-called wood buffalo is a distinct species, and although they are not able to offer scientific proofs, yet the difference in size, color, hair, and horns, are enumerated as the evidence upon which they base their statement. Men from their youth familiar with these animals in the great plains, and the varieties which are frequently met with in large herds, still cling to this opinion. The buffalo of the plains are not always of the dark and rich bright brown which forms their characteristic color. They are sometimes seen from white to almost black, and a gray buffalo is not at all uncommon. Buffalo emasculated by wolves are often found on the prairies, where they grow to an immense size; the skin of the buffalo ox is recognized by the shortness of the wool and by its large dimensions. The skin of the so-called wood buffalo is much larger than that of the common animal, the hair is very short, mane or hair about the neck short and soft, and altogether destitute of curl, which is the common feature in the hair or wool of the prairie animal. Two skins of the so-called wood buffalo, which I saw at Selkirk Settlement, bore a very close resemblance to the skin of the Lithuanian bison, judging from the specimens of that species which I have since had an opportunity of seeing in the British Museum. ""The wood buffalo is stated to be very scarce, and only found north of the Saskatchewan and on the flanks of the Rocky Mountains. It never ventures into the open plains. The prairie buffalo, on the contrary, generally avoids the woods in summer and keeps to the open country; but in winter they are frequently found in the woods of the Little Souris, Saskatchewan, the Touchwood Hills, and the aspen groves on the Qu'Appelle. There is no doubt that formerly the prairie buffalo ranged through open woods almost as much as he now does through the prairies."" Mr. Harrison S. Young, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, stationed at Fort Edmonton, writes me as follows in a letter dated October 22, 1887: ""In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, there are still a few wood buffalo killed every year; but they are fast diminishing in numbers, and are also becoming very shy."" In Prof. John Macoun's ""Manitoba and the Great Northwest,"" page 342, there occurs the following reference to the wood buffalo: ""In the winter of 1870 the last buffalo were killed north of Peace River; but in 1875 about one thousand head were still in existence between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers, north of Little Slave Lake. These are called wood buffalo by the hunters, but diner only in size from those of the plain."" In the absence of facts based on personal observations, I may be permitted to advance an opinion in regard to the wood buffalo. There is some reason for the belief that certain changes of form may have taken place in the buffaloes that have taken up a permanent residence in rugged and precipitous mountain regions. Indeed, it is hardly possible to understand how such a radical change in the habitat of an animal could fail, through successive generations, to effect certain changes in the animal itself. It seems to me that the changes which would take place in a band of plains buffaloes transferred to a permanent mountain habitat can be forecast with a marked degree of certainty. The changes that take place under such conditions in cattle, swine, and goats are well known, and similar causes would certainly produce similar results in the buffalo. The scantier feed of the mountains, and the great waste of vital energy called for in procuring it, would hardly produce a larger buffalo than the plains-fed animal, who acquires an abundance of daily food of the best quality with but little effort. We should expect to see the mountain buffalo smaller in body than the plains animal, with better leg development, and particularly with stronger hind quarters. The pelvis of the plains buffalo is surprisingly small and weak for so large an animal. Beyond question, constant mountain climbing is bound to develop a maximum of useful muscle and bone and a minimum of useless fat. If the loss of mane sustained by the African lions who live in bushy localities may be taken as an index, we should expect the bison of the mountains, especially the ""wood buffalo,"" to lose a great deal of his shaggy frontlet and mane on the bushes and trees which surrounded him. Therefore, we would naturally expect to find the hair on those parts shorter and in far less perfect condition than on the bison of the treeless prairies. By reason of the more shaded condition of his home, and the decided mitigation of the sun's fierceness, we should also expect to see his entire pelage of a darker tone. That he would acquire a degree of agility and strength unknown in his relative of the plain is reasonably certain. In the course of many centuries the change in his form might become well defined, constant, and conspicuous; but at present there is apparently not the slightest ground for considering that the ""mountain buffalo"" or ""wood buffalo"" is entitled to rank even as a variety of _Bison americanus_. Colonel Dodge has recorded some very interesting information in regard to the ""mountain, or wood buffalo,"" which deserves to be quoted entire.[34] [Note 34: Plains of the Great West, p. 144-147.] ""In various portions of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the region of the parks, is found an animal which old mountaineers call the 'bison.' This animal bears about the same relation to a plains buffalo as a sturdy mountain pony does to an American horse. His body is lighter, whilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incredible in such a huge and apparently unwieldy beast. ""These animals are by no means plentiful, and are moreover excessively shy, inhabiting the deepest, darkest defiles, or the craggy, almost precipitous, sides of mountains inaccessible to any but the most practiced mountaineers. ""From the tops of the mountains which rim the parks the rains of ages have cut deep gorges, which plunge with brusque abruptness, but nevertheless with great regularity, hundreds or even thousands of feet to the valley below. Down the bottom of each such gorge a clear, cold stream of purest water, fertilizing a narrow belt of a few feet of alluvial, and giving birth and growth, to a dense jungle of spruce, quaking asp, and other mountain trees. One side of the gorge is generally a thick forest of pine, while the other side is a meadow-like park, covered with splendid grass. Such gorges are the favorite haunt of the mountain buffalo. Early in the morning he enjoys a bountiful breakfast of the rich nutritious grasses, quenches his thirst with the finest water, and, retiring just within the line of jungle, where, himself unseen, he can scan the open, he crouches himself in the long grass and reposes in comfort and security until appetite calls him to his dinner late in the evening. Unlike their plains relative, there is no stupid staring at an intruder. At the first symptom of danger they disappear like magic in the thicket, and never stop until far removed from even the apprehension of pursuit. I have many times come upon their fresh tracks, upon the beds from which they had first sprung in alarm, but I have never even seen one. ""I have wasted much time and a great deal of wind in vain endeavors to add one of these animals to my bag. My figure is no longer adapted to mountain climbing, and the possession of a bison's head of my own killing is one of my blighted hopes. ""Several of my friends have been more fortunate, but I know of no sportsman who has bagged more than one.[35] [Note 35: Foot-note by William Blackmore: ""The author is in error here, as in a point of the Tarryall range of mountains, between Pike's Peak and the South Park, in the autumn of 1871, two mountain buffaloes were killed in one afternoon. The skin of the finer was presented to Dr. Frank Buckland.""] ""Old mountaineers and trappers have given me wonderful accounts of the number of these animals in all the mountain region 'many years ago;' and I have been informed by them, that their present rarity is due to the great snow-storm of 1844-'45, of which I have already spoken as destroying the plains buffalo in the Laramie country. ""One of my friends, a most ardent and pertinacious sportsman, determined on the possession of a bison's head, and, hiring a guide, plunged into the mountain wilds which separate the Middle from South Park. After several days fresh tracks were discovered. Turning their horses loose on a little gorge park, such as described, they started on foot on the trail; for all that day they toiled and scrambled with the utmost caution--now up, now down, through deep and narrow gorges and pine thickets, over bare and rocky crags, sleeping where night overtook them. Betimes next morning they pushed on the trail, and about 11 o'clock, when both were exhausted and well-nigh disheartened, their route was intercepted by a precipice. Looking over, they descried, on a projecting ledge several hundred feet below, a herd of about 20 bisons lying down. The ledge was about 300 feet at widest, by probably 1,000 feet long. Its inner boundary was the wall of rock on the top of which they stood; its outer appeared to be a sheer precipice of at least 200 feet. This ledge was connected with the slope of the mountain by a narrow neck. The wind being right, the hunters succeeded in reaching this neck unobserved. My friend selected a magnificent head, that of a fine bull, young but full grown, and both fired. At the report the bisons all ran to the far end of the ledge and plunged over. ""Terribly disappointed, the hunters ran to the spot, and found that they had gone down a declivity, not actually a precipice, but so steep that the hunters could not follow them. ""At the foot lay a bison. A long, a fatiguing detour brought them to the spot, and in the animal lying dead before him my friend recognized his bull--his first and last mountain buffalo. Hone but a true sportsman can appreciate his feelings. ""The remainder of the herd was never seen after the great plunge, down which it is doubtful if even a dog could have followed unharmed."" In the issue of Forest and Stream of June 14, 1888, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, in an article entitled ""The American Buffalo,"" relates a very interesting experience with buffaloes which were pronounced to be of the ""mountain"" variety, and his observations on the animals are well worth reproducing here. The animals (eight in number) were encountered on the northern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, in the autumn of 1877. ""We came upon them during a fearful blizzard of heavy hail, during which our animals could scarcely retain their feet. In fact, the packer's mule absolutely lay down on the ground rather than risk being blown down the mountain side, and my own horse, totally unable to face such a violent blow and the pelting hail (the stones being as large as big marbles), positively stood stock-still, facing an old buffalo bull that was not more than 25 feet in front of me. * * * Strange to say, this fearful gust did not last more than ten minutes, when it stopped as suddenly as it had commenced, and I deliberately killed my old buffalo at one shot, just where he stood, and, separating two other bulls from the rest, charged them down a rugged ravine. They passed over this and into another one, but with less precipitous sides and no trees in the way, and when I was on top of the intervening ridge I noticed that the largest bull had halted in the bottom. Checking my horse, an excellent buffalo hunter, I fired down at him without dismounting. The ball merely barked his shoulder, and to my infinite surprise he turned and charged me up the hill. * * * Stepping to one side of my horse, with the charging and infuriated bull not 10 feet to my front, I fired upon him, and the heavy ball took him square in the chest, bringing him to his knees, with a gush of scarlet blood from his mouth and nostrils. * * * ""Upon examining the specimen, I found it to be an old bull, apparently smaller and very much blacker than the ones I had seen killed on the plains only a day or so before. Then I examined the first one I had shot, as well as others which were killed by the packer from the same bunch, and I came to the conclusion that they were typical representatives of the variety known as the 'mountain buffalo,' a form much more active in movement, of slighter limbs, blacker, and far more dangerous to attack. My opinion in the premises remains unaltered to-day. In all this I may be mistaken, but it was also the opinion held by the old buffalo hunter who accompanied me, and who at once remarked when he saw them that they were 'mountain buffalo,' and not the plains variety. * * * ""These specimens were not actually measured by me in either case, and their being considered smaller only rested upon my judging them by my eye. But they were of a softer pelage, black, lighter in limb, and when discovered were in the timber, on the side of the Big Horn Mountains."" The band of bison in the Yellowstone Park must, of necessity, be of the so-called ""wood"" or ""mountain"" variety, and if by any chance one of its members ever dies of old age, it is to be hoped its skin may be carefully preserved and sent to the National Museum to throw some further light on this question. 11. _The shedding of the winter pelage._--In personal appearance the buffalo is subject to striking, and even painful, variations, and the estimate an observer forms of him is very apt to depend upon the time of the year at which the observation is made. Toward the end of the winter the whole coat has become faded and bleached by the action of the sun, wind, snow, and rain, until the freshness of its late autumn colors has totally disappeared. The bison takes on a seedy, weathered, and rusty look. But this is not a circumstance to what happens to him a little later. Promptly with the coming of the spring, if not even in the last week of February, the buffalo begins the shedding of his winter coat. It is a long and difficult task, and with commendable energy he sets about it at the earliest possible moment. It lasts him more than half the year, and is attended with many positive discomforts. The process of shedding is accomplished in two ways: by the new hair growing into and forcing off the old, and by the old hair falling off in great patches, leaving the skin bare. On the heavily-haired portions--the head, neck, fore quarters, and hump--the old hair stops growing, dies, and the new hair immediately starts through the skin and forces it off. The new hair grows so rapidly, and at the same time so densely, that it forces itself into the old, becomes hopelessly entangled with it, and in time actually lifts the old hair clear of the skin. On the head the new hair is dark brown or black, but on the neck, fore quarters, and hump it has at first, and indeed until it is 2 inches in length, a peculiar gray or drab color, mixed with brown, totally different from its final and natural color. The new hair starts first on the head, but the actual shedding of the old hair is to be seen first along the lower parts of the neck and between the fore legs. The heavily-haired parts are never bare, but, on the contrary, the amount of hair upon them is about the same all the year round. The old and the new hair cling together with provoking tenacity long after the old coat should fall, and on several of the bulls we killed in October there were patches of it still sticking tightly to the shoulders, from which it had to be forcibly plucked away. Under all such patches the new hair was of a different color from that around them. The other process of shedding takes place on the body and hind quarters, from which the old hair loosens and drops off in great woolly flakes a foot square, more or less. The shedding takes place very unevenly, the old hair remaining much longer in some places than in others. During April, May, and June the body and hind quarters present a most ludicrous and even pitiful spectacle. The island-like patches of persistent old hair alternating with patches of bare brown skin are adorned (?) by great ragged streamers of loose hair, which flutter in the wind like signals of distress. Whoever sees a bison at this period is filled with a desire to assist nature by plucking off the flying streamers of old hair; but the bison never permits anything of the kind, however good one's intentions may be. All efforts to dislodge the old hair are resisted to the last extremity, and the buffalo generally acts as if the intention were to deprive him of his skin itself. By the end of June, if not before, the body and hind quarters are free from the old hair, and as bare as the hide of a hippopotamus. The naked skin has a shiny brown appearance, and of course the external anatomy of the animal is very distinctly revealed. But for the long hair on the fore quarters, neck, and head the bison would lose all his dignity of appearance with his hair. As it is, the handsome black head, which is black with new hair as early as the first of May, redeems the animal from utter homeliness. After the shedding of the body hair, the naked skin of the buffalo is burned by the sun and bitten by flies until he is compelled to seek a pool of water, or even a bed of soft mud, in which to roll and make himself comfortable. He wallows, not so much because he is so fond of either water or mud, but in self-defense; and when he emerges from his wallow, plastered with mud from head to tail, his degradation is complete. He is then simply not fit to be seen, even by his best friends. By the first of October, a complete and wonderful transformation has taken place. The buffalo stands forth clothed in a complete new suit of hair, fine, clean, sleek, and bright in color, not a speck of dirt nor a lock awry anywhere. To be sure, it is as yet a trifle short on the body, where it is not over an inch in length, and hardly that; but it is growing rapidly and getting ready for winter. From the 20th of November to the 20th of December the pelage is at its very finest. By the former date it has attained its full growth, its colors are at their brightest, and nothing has been lost either by the elements or by accidental causes. To him who sees an adult bull at this period, or near it, the grandeur of the animal is irresistibly felt. After seeing buffaloes of all ages in the spring and summer months the contrast afforded by those seen in October, November, and December was most striking and impressive. In the later period, as different individuals were wounded and brought to bay at close quarters, their hair was so clean and well-kept, that more than once I was led to exclaim: ""He looks as if he had just been combed."" It must be remarked, however, that the long hair of the head and fore quarters is disposed in locks or tufts, and to comb it in reality would utterly destroy its natural and characteristic appearance. Inasmuch as the pelage of the domesticated bison, the only representatives of the species which will be found alive ten years hence, will in all likelihood develop differently from that of the wild animal, it may some time in the future be of interest to know the length, by careful measurement, of the hair found on carefully-selected typical wild specimens. To this end the following measurements are given. It must be borne in mind that these specimens were not chosen because their pelage was particularly luxuriant, but rather because they are fine average specimens. The hair of the adult bull is by no means as long as I have seen on a bison, although perhaps not many have greatly surpassed it. It is with the lower animals as with man--the length of the hairy covering is an individual character only. I have in my possession a tuft of hair, from the frontlet of a rather small bull bison, which measures 221/2 inches in length. The beard on the specimen from which this came was correspondingly long, and the entire pelage was of wonderful length and density. LENGTH OF THE HAIR OF BISON AMERICANUS.

I have met many old buffalo hunters, who had killed thousands and seen scores of thousands of buffaloes, yet never had seen a white one. From all accounts it appears that not over ten or eleven white buffaloes, or white buffalo skins, were ever seen by white men. Pied individuals were occasionally obtained, but even they were rare. Albino buffaloes were always so highly prized that not a single one, so far as I can learn, ever had the good fortune to attain adult size, their appearance being so striking, in contrast with the other members of the herd, as to draw upon them an unusual number of enemies, and cause their speedy destruction. At the New Orleans Exposition, in 1884-'85, the Territory of Dakota exhibited, amongst other Western quadrupeds, the mounted skin of a two-year-old buffalo which might fairly be called an albino. Although not really white, it was of a uniform dirty cream-color, and showed not a trace of the bison's normal color on any part of its body. Lieut. Col. S. C. Kellogg, U. S. Army, has on deposit in the National Museum a tanned skin which is said to have come from a buffalo. It is from an animal about one year old, and the hair upon it, which is short, very curly or wavy, and rather coarse, is pure white. In length and texture the hair does not in any one respect resemble the hair of a yearling buffalo save in one particular,--along the median line of the neck and hump there is a rather long, thin mane of hair, which has the peculiar woolly appearance of genuine buffalo hair on those parts. On the shoulder portions of the skin the hair is as short as on the hind quarters. I am inclined to believe this rather remarkable specimen came from a wild half-breed calf, the result of a cross between a white domestic cow and a buffalo bull. At one time it was by no means uncommon for small bunches of domestic cattle to enter herds of buffalo and remain there permanently. I have been informed that the late General Marcy possessed a white buffalo skin. If it is still in existence, and is really _white_, it is to be hoped that so great a rarity may find a permanent abiding place in some museum where the remains of _Bison americanus_ are properly appreciated. V. THE HABITS OF THE BUFFALO. The history of the buffalo's daily life and habits should begin with the ""running season."" This period occupied the months of August and September, and was characterized by a degree of excitement and activity throughout the entire herd quite foreign to the ease-loving and even slothful nature which was so noticeable a feature of the bison's character at all other times. The mating season occurred when the herd was on its summer range. The spring calves were from two to four months old. Through continued feasting on the new crop of buffalo-grass and bunch-grass--the most nutritious in the world, perhaps--every buffalo in the herd had grown round-sided, fat, and vigorous. The faded and weather-beaten suit of winter hair had by that time fallen off and given place to the new coat of dark gray and black, and, excepting for the shortness of his hair, the buffalo was in prime condition. During the ""running season,"" as it was called by the plainsmen, the whole nature of the herd was completely changed. Instead of being broken up into countless small groups and dispersed over a vast extent of territory, the herd came together in a dense and confused mass of many thousand individuals, so closely congregated as to actually blacken the face of the landscape. As if by a general and irresistible impulse, every straggler would be drawn to the common center, and for miles on every side of the great herd the country would be found entirely deserted. At this time the herd itself became a seething mass of activity and excitement. As usual under such conditions, the bulls were half the time chasing the cows, and fighting each other during the other half. These actual combats, which were always of short duration and over in a few seconds after the actual collision took place, were preceded by the usual threatening demonstrations, in which the bull lowers his head until his nose almost touches the ground, roars like a fog-horn until the earth seems to fairly tremble with the vibration, glares madly upon his adversary with half-white eyeballs, and with his forefeet paws up the dry earth and throws it upward in a great cloud of dust high above his back. At such times the mingled roaring--it can not truthfully be described as lowing or bellowing--of a number of huge bulls unite and form a great volume of sound like distant thunder, which has often been heard at a distance of from 1 to 3 miles. I have even been assured by old plainsmen that under favorable atmospheric conditions such sounds have been heard five miles. Notwithstanding the extreme frequency of combats between the bulls during this season, their results were nearly always harmless, thanks to the thickness of the hair and hide on the head and shoulders, and the strength of the neck. Under no conditions was there ever any such thing as the pairing off or mating of male and female buffaloes for any length of time. In the entire process of reproduction the bison's habits were similar to those of domestic cattle. For years the opinion was held by many, in some cases based on misinterpreted observations, that in the herd the identity of each family was partially preserved, and that each old bull maintained an individual harem and group of progeny of his own. The observations of Colonel Dodge completely disprove this very interesting theory; for at best it was only a picturesque fancy, ascribing to the bison a degree of intelligence which he never possessed. At the close of the breeding season the herd quickly settles down to its normal condition. The mass gradually resolves itself into the numerous bands or herdlets of from twenty to a hundred individuals, so characteristic of bison on their feeding grounds, and these gradually scatter in search of the best grass until the herd covers many square miles of country. In his search for grass the buffalo displayed but little intelligence or power of original thought. Instead of closely following the divides between water courses where the soil was best and grass most abundant, he would not hesitate to wander away from good feeding-grounds into barren ""bad lands,"" covered with sage-brush, where the grass was very thin and very poor. In such broken country as Montana, Wyoming, and southwestern Dakota, the herds, on reaching the best grazing grounds on the divides, would graze there day after day until increasing thirst compelled them to seek for water. Then, actuated by a common impulse, the search for a water-hole was begun in a business-like way. The leader of a herd, or ""bunch,"" which post was usually filled by an old cow, would start off down the nearest ""draw,"" or stream-heading, and all the rest would fall into line and follow her. From the moment this start was made there was no more feeding, save as a mouthful of grass could be snatched now and then without turning aside. In single file, in a line sometimes half a mile long and containing between one and two hundred buffaloes, the procession slowly marched down the coulÃ©e, close alongside the gully as soon as the water-course began to cut a pathway for itself. When the gully curved to right or left the leader would cross its bed and keep straight on until the narrow ditch completed its wayward curve and came back to the middle of the coulÃ©e. The trail of a herd in search of water is usually as good a piece of engineering as could be executed by the best railway surveyor, and is governed by precisely the same principles. It always follows the level of the valley, swerves around the high points, and crosses the stream repeatedly in order to avoid climbing up from the level. The same trail is used again and again by different herds until the narrow path, not over a foot in width, is gradually cut straight down into the soil to a depth of several inches, as if it had been done by a 12-inch grooving-plane. By the time the trail has been worn down to a depth of 6 or 7 inches, without having its width increased in the least, it is no longer a pleasant path to walk in, being too much like a narrow ditch. Then the buffaloes abandon it and strike out a new one alongside, which is used until it also is worn down and abandoned. To day the old buffalo trails are conspicuous among the very few classes of objects which remain as a reminder of a vanished race. The herds of cattle now follow them in single file just as the buffaloes did a few years ago, as they search for water in the same way. In some parts of the West, in certain situations, old buffalo trails exist which the wild herds wore down to a depth of 2 feet or more. Mile after mile marched the herd, straight down-stream, bound for the upper water-hole. As the hot summer drew on, the pools would dry up one by one, those nearest the source being the first to disappear. Toward the latter part of summer, the journey for water was often a long one. Hole after hole would be passed without finding a drop of water. At last a hole of mud would be found, below that a hole with a little muddy water, and a mile farther on the leader would arrive at a shallow pool under the edge of a ""cut bank,"" a white, snow-like deposit of alkali on the sand encircling its margin, and incrusting the blades of grass and rushed that grew up from the bottom. The damp earth around the pool was cut up by a thousand hoof-prints, and the water was warm, strongly impregnated with alkali, and yellow with animal impurities, but it was _water_. The nauseous mixture was quickly surrounded by a throng of thirsty, heated, and eager buffaloes of all ages, to which the oldest and strongest asserted claims of priority. There was much crowding and some fighting, but eventually all were satisfied. After such a long journey to water, a herd would usually remain by it for some hours, lying down, resting, and drinking at intervals until completely satisfied. Having drunk its fill, the herd would never march directly back to the choice feeding grounds it had just left, but instead would leisurely stroll off at a right angle from the course it came, cropping for awhile the rich bunch grasses of the bottom-lands, and then wander across the hills in an almost aimless search for fresh fields and pastures new. When buffaloes remained long in a certain locality it was a common thing for them to visit the same watering-place a number of times, at intervals of greater or less duration, according to circumstances. When undisturbed on his chosen range, the bison used to be fond of lying down for an hour or two in the middle of the day, particularly when fine weather and good grass combined to encourage him in luxurious habits. I once discovered with the field glass a small herd of buffaloes lying down at midday on the slope of a high ridge, and having ridden hard for several hours we seized the opportunity to unsaddle and give our horses an hour's rest before making the attack. While we were so doing, the herd got up, shifted its position to the opposite side of the ridge, and again laid down, every buffalo with his nose pointing to windward. Old hunters declare that in the days of their abundance, when feeding on their ranges in fancied security, the younger animals were as playful as well-fed domestic calves. It was a common thing to see them cavort and frisk around with about as much grace as young elephants, prancing and running to and fro with tails held high in air ""like scorpions."" Buffaloes are very fond of rolling in dry dirt or even in mud, and this habit is quite strong in captive animals. Not only is it indulged in during the shedding season, but all through the fall and winter. The two live buffaloes in the National Museum are so much given to rolling, even in rainy weather, that it is necessary to card them every few days to keep them presentable. Bulls are much more given to rolling than the cows, especially after they have reached maturity. They stretch out at full length, rub their heads violently to and fro on the ground, in which the horn serves as the chief point of contact and slides over the ground like a sled-runner. After thoroughly scratching one side on mother earth they roll over and treat the other in like manner. Notwithstanding his sharp and lofty hump, a buffalo bull can roll completely over with as much ease as any horse. The vast amount of rolling and side-scratching on the earth indulged in by bull buffaloes is shown in the worn condition of the horns of every old specimen. Often a thickness of half an inch is gone from the upper half of each horn on its outside curve, at which point the horn is worn quite flat. This is well illustrated in the horns shown in the accompanying plate, fig. 6. [Illustration: DEVELOPMENT OF THE HORNS OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 1. The Calf. 2. The Yearling. 3. Spike Bull, 2 years old. 4. Spike Bull, 3 years old. 5. Bull, 4 years old. 6. Bull, 11 years old. 7. Old ""stub-horn"" Bull, 20 years old.] Mr. Catlin[36] affords some very interesting and valuable information in regard to the bison's propensity for wollowing in mad, and also the origin of the ""fairy circles,"" which have caused so much speculation amongst travelers: [Note 36: North American Indians, vol. I, p. 249, 250.] ""In the heat of summer, these huge animals, which no doubt suffer very much with the great profusion of their long and shaggy hair, or fur, often graze on the low grounds of the prairies, where there is a little stagnant water lying amongst the grass, and the ground underneath being saturated with it, is soft, into which the enormous bull, lowered down upon one knee, will plunge his horns, and at last his head, driving up the earth, and soon making an excavation in the ground into which the water filters from amongst the grass, forming for him in a few moments a cool and comfortable bath, into which he plunges like a hog in his mire. ""In this delectable laver he throws himself flat upon his side, and forcing himself violently around, with his horns and his huge hump on his shoulders presented to the sides, he ploughs up the ground by his rotary motion, sinking himself deeper and deeper in the ground, continually enlarging his pool, in which he at length becomes nearly immersed, and the water and mud about him mixed into a complete mortar, which changes his color and drips in streams from every part of him as he rises up upon his feet, a hideous monster of mud and ugliness, too frightful and too eccentric to be described! ""It is generally the leader of the herd that takes upon him to make this excavation, and if not (but another one opens the ground), the leader (who is conqueror) marches forward, and driving the other from it plunges himself into it; and, having cooled his sides and changed his color to a walking mass of mud and mortar, he stands in the pool until inclination induces him to step out and give place to the next in command who stands ready, and another, and another, who advance forward in their turns to enjoy the luxury of the wallow, until the whole band (sometimes a hundred or more) will pass through it in turn,[37] each one throwing his body around in a similar manner and each one adding a little to the dimensions of the pool, while he carries away in his hair an equal share of the clay, which dries to a gray or whitish color and gradually falls off. By this operation, which is done perhaps in the space of half an hour, a circular excavation of fifteen or twenty feet in diameter and two feet in depth is completed and left for the water to run into, which soon fills it to the level of the ground. [Note 37: In the District of Columbia work-house we have a counterpart of this in the public bath-tub, wherein forty prisoners were seen by a _Star_ reporter to bathe one after another in the same water!] ""To these sinks, the waters lying on the surface of the prairies are continually draining and in them lodging their vegetable deposits, which after a lapse of years fill them up to the surface with a rich soil, which throws up an unusual growth of grass and herbage, forming conspicuous circles, which arrest the eye of the traveler and are calculated to excite his surprise for ages to come."" During the latter part of the last century, when the bison inhabited Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the salt springs of those States were resorted to by thousands of those animals, who drank of the saline waters and licked the impregnated earth. Mr. Thomas Ashe[38] affords us a most interesting account, from the testimony of an eye witness, of the behavior of a bison at a salt spring. The description refers to a locality in western Pennsylvania, where ""an old man, one of the first settlers of this country, built his log house on the immediate borders of a salt spring. He informed me that for the first several seasons the buffaloes paid him their visits with the utmost regularity; they traveled in single files, always following each other at equal distances, forming droves, on their arrival, of about 300 each. [Note 38: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.] ""The first and second years, so unacquainted were these poor brutes with the use of this man's house or with his nature, that in a few hours they _rubbed_ the house completely down, taking delight in turning the logs off with their horns, while he had some difficulty to escape from being trampled under their feet or crushed to death in his own ruins. At that period he supposed there could not have been less than 2,000 in the neighborhood of the spring. They sought for no manner of food, but only bathed and drank three or four times a day and rolled in the earth, or reposed with their flanks distended in the adjacent shades; and on the fifth and sixth days separated into distinct droves, bathed, drank, and departed in single files, according to the exact order of their arrival. They all rolled successively in the same hole, and each thus carried away a coat of mud to preserve the moisture on their skin and which, when hardened and baked in the sun, would resist the stings of millions of insects that otherwise would persecute these peaceful travelers to madness or even death."" It was a fixed habit with the great buffalo herds to move southward from 200 to 400 miles at the approach of winter. Sometimes this movement was accomplished quietly and without any excitement, but at other times it was done with a rush, in which considerable distances would be gone over on the double quick. The advance of a herd was often very much like that of a big army, in a straggling line, from four to ten animals abreast. Sometimes the herd moved forward in a dense mass, and in consequence often came to grief in quicksands, alkali bogs, muddy crossings, and on treacherous ice. In such places thousands of buffaloes lost their lives, through those in the lead being forced into danger by pressure of the mass coming behind. In this manner, in the summer of 1867, over two thousand buffaloes, out of a herd of about four thousand, lost their lives in the quicksands of the Platte River, near Plum Creek, while attempting to cross. One winter, a herd of nearly a hundred buffaloes attempted to cross a lake called Lac-qui-parle, in Minnesota, upon the ice, which gave way, and drowned the entire herd. During the days of the buffalo it was a common thing for voyagers on the Missouri River to see buffaloes hopelessly mired in the quicksands or mud along the shore, either dead or dying, and to find their dead bodies floating down the river, or lodged on the upper ends of the islands and sand-bars. Such accidents as these: it may be repeated, were due to the great number of animals and the momentum of the moving mass. The forced marches of the great herds were like the flight of a routed army, in which helpless individuals were thrust into mortal peril by the irresistible force of the mass coming behind, which rushes blindly on after their leaders. In this way it was possible to decoy a herd toward a precipice and cause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being thrust over by their followers, and all the rest following of their own free will, like the sheep who cheerfully leaped, one after another, through a hole in the side of a high bridge because their bell-wether did so. But it is not to be understood that the movement of a great herd, because it was made on a run, necessarily partook of the nature of a stampede in which a herd sweeps forward in a body. The most graphic account that I ever obtained of facts bearing on this point was furnished by Mr. James McNaney, drawn from his experience on the northern buffalo range in 1882. His party reached the range (on Beaver Creek, about 100 miles south of Glendive) about the middle of November, and found buffaloes already there; in fact they had begun to arrive from the north as early as the middle of October. About the first of December an immense herd arrived from the north. It reached their vicinity one night, about 10 o'clock, in a mass that seemed to spread everywhere. As the hunters sat in their tents, loading cartridges and cleaning their rifles, a low rumble was heard, which gradually increased to ""a thundering noise,"" and some one exclaimed, ""There! that's a big herd of buffalo coming in!"" All ran out immediately, and hallooed and discharged rifles to keep the buffaloes from running over their tents. Fortunately, the horses were picketed some distance away in a grassy coulÃ©e, which the buffaloes did not enter. The herd came at a jog trot, and moved quite rapidly. ""In the morning the whole country was black with buffalo."" It was estimated that 10,000 head were in sight. One immense detachment went down on to a ""flat"" and laid down. There it remained quietly, enjoying a long rest, for about ten days. It gradually broke up into small bands, which strolled off in various directions looking for food, and which the hunters quietly attacked. A still more striking event occurred about Christmas time at the same place. For a few days the neighborhood of McNaney's camp had been entirely deserted by buffaloes, not even one remaining. But one morning about daybreak a great herd which was traveling south began to pass their camp. A long line of moving forms was seen advancing rapidly from the northwest, coming in the direction of the hunters' camp. It disappeared in the creek valley for a few moments, and presently the leaders suddenly came in sight again at the top of ""a rise"" a few hundred yards away, and came down the intervening slope at full speed, within 50 yards of the two tents. After them came a living stream of followers, all going at a gallop, described by the observer as ""a long lope,"" from four to ten buffaloes abreast. Sometimes there would be a break in the column of a minute's duration, then more buffaloes would appear at the brow of the hill, and the column went rushing by as before. The calves ran with their mothers, and the young stock got over the ground with much less exertion than the older animals. For about four hours, or until past 11 o'clock, did this column of buffaloes gallop past the camp over a course no wider than a village street. Three miles away toward the south the long dark line of bobbing humps and hind quarters wound to the right between two hills and disappeared. True to their instincts, the hunters promptly brought out their rifles, and began to fire at the buffaloes as they ran. A furious fusilade was kept up from the very doors of the tents, and from first to last over fifty buffaloes were killed. Some fell headlong the instant they were hit, but the greater number ran on until their mortal wounds compelled them to halt, draw off a little way to one side, and finally fall in their death struggles. Mr. McNaney stated that the hunters estimated the number of buffaloes _on that portion_ of the range that winter (1881-'82) at 100,000. It is probable, and in fact reasonably certain, that such forced-march migrations as the above were due to snow-covered pastures and a scarcity of food on the more northern ranges. Having learned that a journey south will bring him to regions of less snow and more grass, it is but natural that so lusty a traveler should migrate. The herds or bands which started south in the fall months traveled more leisurely, with frequent halts to graze on rich pastures. The advance was on a very different plan, taking place in straggling lines and small groups dispersed over quite a scope of country. Unless closely pursued, the buffalo never chose to make a journey of several miles through hilly country on a continuous run. Even when fleeing from the attack of a hunter, I have often had occasion to notice that, if the hunter was a mile behind, the buffalo would always walk when going uphill; but as soon as the crest was gained he would begin to run, and go down the slope either at a gallop or a swift trot. In former times, when the buffalo's world was wide, when retreating from an attack he always ran against the wind, to avoid running upon a new danger, which showed that he depended more upon his sense of smell than his eye-sight. During the last years of his existence, however, this habit almost totally disappeared, and the harried survivors learned to run for the regions which offered the greatest safety. But even to-day, if a Texas hunter should go into the Staked Plains, and descry in the distance a body of animals running against the wind, he would, without a moment's hesitation, pronounce them buffaloes, and the chances are that he would be right. In winter the buffalo used to face the storms, instead of turning tail and ""drifting"" before them helplessly, as domestic cattle do. But at the same time, when beset by a blizzard, he would wisely seek shelter from it in some narrow and deep valley or system of ravines. There the herd would lie down and wait patiently for the storm to cease. After a heavy fall of snow, the place to find the buffalo was in the flats and creek bottoms, where the tall, rank bunch-grasses showed their tops above the snow, and afforded the best and almost the only food obtainable. When the snow-fall was unusually heavy, and lay for a long time on the ground, the buffalo was forced to fast for days together, and sometimes even weeks. If a warm day came, and thawed the upper surface of the snow sufficiently for succeeding cold to freeze it into a crust, the outlook for the bison began to be serious. A man can travel over a crust through which the hoofs of a ponderous bison cut like chisels and leave him floundering belly-deep. It was at such times that the Indians hunted him on snow-shoes, and drove their spears into his vitals as he wallowed helplessly in the drifts. Then the wolves grew fat upon the victims which they, also, slaughtered almost without effort. Although buffaloes did not often actually perish from hunger and cold during the severest winters (save in a few very exceptional cases), they often came out in very poor condition. The old bulls always suffered more severely than the rest, and at the end of winter were frequently in miserable plight. Unlike most other terrestrial quadrupeds of America, so long as he could roam at will the buffalo had settled migratory habits.[39] While the elk and black-tail deer change their altitude twice a year, in conformity with the approach and disappearance of winter, the buffalo makes a radical change of latitude. This was most noticeable in the great western pasture region, where the herds were most numerous and their movements most easily observed. [Note 39: On page 248 of his ""North American Indians,"" vol. I, Mr. Catlin declares pointedly that ""these animals are, truly speaking, gregarious, but not migratory; they graze in immense and almost incredible numbers at times, and roam about and over vast tracts of country from east to west and from west to east as often as from north to south, which has often been supposed they naturally and habitually did to accommodate themselves to the temperature of the climate in the different latitudes."" Had Mr. Catlin resided continuously in any one locality on the great buffalo range, he would have found that the buffalo had decided migratory habits. The abundance of proof on this point renders it unnecessary to eater fully into the details of the subject.] At the approach of winter the whole great system of herds which ranged from the Peace River to the Indian Territory moved south a few hundred miles, and wintered under more favorable circumstances than each band would have experienced at its farthest north. Thus it happened that nearly the whole of the great range south of the Saskatchewan was occupied by buffaloes even in winter. The movement north began with the return of mild weather in the early spring. Undoubtedly this northward migration was to escape the heat of their southern winter range rather than to find better pasture; for as a grazing country for cattle all the year round, Texas is hardly surpassed, except where it is overstocked. It was with the buffaloes a matter of choice rather than necessity which sent them on their annual pilgrimage northward. Col. R. I. Dodge, who has made many valuable observations on the migratory habits of the southern buffaloes, has recorded the following:[40] ""Early in spring, as soon as the dry and apparently desert prairie had begun to change its coat of dingy brown to one of palest green, the horizon would begin to be dotted with buffalo, single or in groups of two or three, forerunners of the coming herd. Thicker and thicker and in larger groups they come, until by the time the grass is well up the whole vast landscape appears a mass of buffalo, some individuals feeding, others standing, others lying down, but the herd moving slowly, moving constantly to the northward. * * * Some years, as in 1871, the buffalo appeared to move northward in one immense column oftentimes from 20 to 50 miles in width, and of unknown depth from front to rear. Other years the northward journey was made in several parallel columns, moving at the same rate, and with their numerous flankers covering a width of a hundred or more miles. ""The line of march of this great spring migration was not always the same, though it was confined within certain limits. I am informed by old frontiersmen that it has not within twenty-five years crossed the Arkansas River east of Great Bend nor west of Big Sand Creek. The most favored routes crossed the Arkansas at the mouth of Walnut Creek, Pawnee Fork, Mulberry Creek, the Cimarron Crossing, and Big Sand Creek. ""As the great herd proceeds northward it is constantly depleted, numbers wandering off to the right and left, until finally it is scattered in small herds far and wide over the vast feeding grounds, where they pass the summer. ""When the food in one locality fails they go to another, and towards fall, when the grass of the high prairie becomes parched by the heat and drought, they gradually work their way back to the south, concentrating on the rich pastures of Texas and the Indian Territory, whence, the same instinct acting on all, they are ready to start together on the northward march as soon as spring starts the grass."" [Note 40: Our Wild Indians, p. 283, _et seq._] So long as the bison held undisputed possession of the great plains his migratory habits were as above--regular, general, and on a scale that was truly grand. The herds that wintered in Texas, the Indian Territory, and New Mexico probably spent their summers in Nebraska, southwestern Dakota, and Wyoming. The winter herds of northern Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and southern Dakota went to northern Dakota and Montana, while the great Montana herds spent the summer on the Grand Coteau des Prairies lying between the Saskatchewan and the Missouri. The two great annual expeditions of the Red River half-breeds, which always took place in summer, went in two directions from Winnipeg and Pembina--one, the White Horse Plain division, going westward along the Qu'Appelle to the Saskatchewan country, and the other, the Red River division, southwest into Dakota. In 1840 the site of the present city of Jamestown, Dakota, was the northeastern limit of the herds that summered in Dakota, and the country lying between that point and the Missouri was for years the favorite hunting ground of the Red River division. The herds which wintered on the Montana ranges always went north in the early spring, usually in March, so that during the time the hunters were hauling in the hides taken on the winter hunt the ranges were entirely deserted. It is equally certain, however, that a few small bauds remained in certain portions of Montana throughout the summer. But the main body crossed the international boundary, and spent the summer on the plains of the Saskatchewan, where they were hunted by the half-breeds from the Red River settlements and the Indians of the plains. It is my belief that in this movement nearly all the buffaloes of Montana and Dakota participated, and that the herds which spent the summer in Dakota, where they were annually hunted by the Red River half-breeds, came up from Kansas, Colorado, and Nebraska. While most of the calves were born on the summer ranges, many were brought forth en route. It was the habit of the cows to retire to a secluded spot, if possible a ravine well screened from observation, bring forth their young, and nourish and defend them until they were strong enough to join the herd. Calves were born all the time from March to July, and sometimes even as late as August. On the summer ranges it was the habit of the cows to leave the bulls at calving time, and thus it often happened that small herds were often seen composed of bulls only. Usually the cow produced but one calf, but twins were not uncommon. Of course many calves were brought forth in the herd, but the favorite habit of the cow was as stated. As soon as the young calves were brought into the herd, which for prudential reasons occurred at the earliest possible moment, the bulls assumed the duty of protecting them from the wolves which at all times congregated in the vicinity of a herd, watching for an opportunity to seize a calf or a wounded buffalo which might be left behind. A calf always follows its mother until its successor is appointed and installed, unless separated from her by force of circumstances. They suck until they are nine months old, or even older, and Mr. McNaney once saw a lusty calf suck its mother (in January) on the Montana range several hours after she had been killed for her skin. When a buffalo is wounded it leaves the herd immediately and goes off as far from the line of pursuit as it can get, to escape the rabble of hunters, who are sure to follow the main body. If any deep ravines are at hand the wounded animal limps away to the bottom of the deepest and most secluded one, and gradually works his way up to its very head, where he finds himself in a perfect cul-de-sac, barely wide enough to admit him. Here he is so completely hidden by the high walls and numerous bends that his pursuer must needs come within a few feet of his horns before his huge bulk is visible. I have more than once been astonished at the real impregnability of the retreats selected by wounded bison. In following up wounded bulls in ravine headings it always became too dangerous to make the last stage of the pursuit on horseback, for fear of being caught in a passage so narrow as to insure a fatal accident to man or horse in case of a sudden discovery of the quarry. I have seen wounded bison shelter in situations where a single bull could easily defend himself from a whole pack of wolves, being completely walled in on both sides and the rear, and leaving his foes no point of attack save his head and horns. Bison which were nursing serious wounds most often have gone many days at a time without either food or water, and in this connection it may be mentioned that the recuperative power of a bison is really wonderful. Judging from the number of old leg wounds, fully healed, which I have found in freshly killed bisons, one may be tempted to believe that a bison never died of a broken leg. One large bull which I skeletonized had had his humerus shot squarely in two, but it had united again more firmly than ever. Another large bull had the head of his left femur and the hip socket shattered completely to pieces by a big ball, but he had entirely recovered from it, and was as lusty a runner as any bull we chased. We found that while a broken leg was a misfortune to a buffalo, it always took something more serious than that to stop him. VI. THE FOOD OF THE BISON. It is obviously impossible to enumerate all the grasses which served the bison as food on his native heath without presenting a complete list of all the plants of that order found in a given region; but it is at least desirable to know which of the grasses of the great pasture region were his favorite and most common food. It was the nutritious character and marvelous abundance of his food supply which enabled the bison to exist in such absolutely countless numbers as characterized his occupancy of the great plains. The following list comprises the grasses which were the bison's principal food, named in the order of their importance: _Bouteloua oligostachya_ (buffalo, grama, or mesquite grass).--This remarkable grass formed the _piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance_ of the bison's bill of fare in the days when he flourished, and it now comes to us daily in the form of beef produced of primest quality and in greatest quantity on what was until recently the great buffalo range. This grass is the most abundant and widely distributed species to be found in the great pasture region between the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and the nineteenth degree of west longitude. It is the principal grass of the plains from Texas to the British Possessions, and even in the latter territory it is quite conspicuous. To any one but a botanist its first acquaintance means a surprise. Its name and fame lead the unacquainted to expect a grass which is tall, rank, and full of ""fodder,"" like the ""blue joint"" (_Andropogon provincialis_). The grama grass is very short, the leaves being usually not more than 2 or 3 inches in length and crowded together at the base of the stems. The flower stalk is about a foot in height, but on grazed lands are eaten off and but seldom seen. The leaves are narrow and inclined to curl, and lie close to the ground. Instead of developing a continuous growth, this grass grows in small, irregular patches, usually about the size of a man's hand, with narrow strips of perfectly bare ground between them. The grass curls closely upon the ground, in a woolly carpet or cushion, greatly resembling a layer of Florida moss. Even in spring-time it never shows more color than a tint of palest green, and the landscape which is dependent upon this grass for color is never more than ""a gray and melancholy waste."" Unlike the soft, juicy, and succulent grasses of the well-watered portions of the United States, the tiny leaves of the grama grass are hard, stiff, and dry. I have often noticed that in grazing neither cattle nor horses are able to bite off the blades, but instead each leaf is pulled out of the tuft, seemingly by its root. Notwithstanding its dry and uninviting appearance, this grass is highly nutritious, and its fat-producing qualities are unexcelled. The heat of summer dries it up effectually without destroying its nutritive elements, and it becomes for the remainder of the year excellent hay, cured on its own roots. It affords good grazing all the year round, save in winter, when it is covered with snow, and even then, if the snow is not too deep, the buffaloes, cattle, and horses paw down through it to reach the grass, or else repair to wind-swept ridges and hill-tops, where the snow has been blown off and left the grass partly exposed. Stock prefer it to all the other grasses of the plains. On bottom-lands, where moisture is abundant, this grass develops much more luxuriantly, growing in a close mass, and often to a height of a foot or more, if not grazed down, when it is cut for hay, and sometimes yields 11/2 tons to the acre. In Montana and the north it is generally known as ""buffalo-grass,"" a name to which it would seem to be fully entitled, notwithstanding the fact that this name is also applied, and quite generally, to another species, the next to be noticed. _BuchloÃ« dactyloides_ (Southern buffalo-grass).--This species is next in value and extent of distribution to the grama grass. It also is found all over the great plains south of Nebraska and southern Wyoming, but not further north, although in many localities it occurs so sparsely as to be of little account. A single bunch of it very greatly resembles _Bouteloua oligostachya_, but its general growth is very different. It is very short, its general mass seldom rising more than 3 inches above the ground. It grows in extensive patches, and spreads by means of stolons, which sometimes are 2 feet in length, with joints every 3 or 4 inches. Owing to its southern distribution this might well be named the Southern buffalo grass, to distinguish it from the two other species of higher latitudes, to which the name ""buffalo"" has been fastened forever. _Stipa spartea_ (Northern buffalo-grass; wild oat).--This grass is found in southern Manitoba, westwardly across the plains to the Rocky Mountains, and southward as far as Montana, where it is common in many localities. On what was once the buffalo range of the British Possessions this rank grass formed the bulk of the winter pasturage, and in that region is quite as famous as our grama grass. An allied species (_Stipa viridula_, bunch-grass) is ""widely diffused over our Rocky Mountain region, extending to California and British America, and furnishing a considerable part of the wild forage of the region"" _Stipa spartea_ bears an ill name among stockmen on account of the fact that at the base of each seed is a very hard and sharp-pointed callus, which under certain circumstances (so it is said) lodges in the cheeks of domestic animals that feed upon this grass when it is dry, and which cause much trouble. But the buffalo, like the wild horse and half-wild range cattle, evidently escaped this annoyance. This grass is one of the common species over a wide area of the northern plains, and is always found on soil which is comparatively dry. In Dakota, Minnesota, and northwest Iowa it forms a considerable portion of the upland prairie hay. Of the remaining grasses it is practically impossible to single out any one as being specially entitled to fourth place in this list. There are several species which flourish in different localities, and in many respects appear to be of about equal importance as food for stock. Of these the following are the most noteworthy: _Aristida purpurea_ (Western beard-grass; purple ""bunch-grass"" of Montana).--On the high, rolling prairies of the Missouri-Yellowstone divide this grass is very abundant. It grows in little solitary bunches, about 6 inches high, scattered through the curly buffalo-grass (_Bouteloua oligostachya_). Under more favorable conditions it grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches. It is one of the prettiest grasses of that region, and in the fall and winter its purplish color makes it quite noticeable. The Montana stockmen consider it one of the most valuable grasses of that region for stock of all kinds. Mr. C. M. Jacobs assured me that the buffalo used to be very fond of this grass, and that ""wherever this grass grew in abundance there were the best hunting-grounds for the bison."" It appears that _Aristida purpurea_ is not sufficiently abundant elsewhere in the Northwest to make it an important food for stock; but Dr. Vesey declares that it is ""abundant on the plains of Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas."" _Koeleria cristata._--Very generally distributed from Texas and New Mexico to the British Possessions; sand hills and arid soils; mountains, up to 8,000 feet. _Poa tenuifolia_ (blue-grass of the plains and mountains).--A valuable ""bunch-grass,"" widely distributed throughout the great pasture region; grows in all sorts of soils and situations; common in the Yellowstone Park. _Festuca scabrella_ (bunch-grass).--One of the most valuable grasses of Montana and the Northwest generally; often called the ""great bunch-grass."" It furnishes excellent food for horses and cattle, and is so tall it is cut in large quantities for hay. This is the prevailing species on the foot-hills and mountains generally, up to an altitude of 7,000 feet, where it is succeeded by _Festuca ovina_. _Andropogon provincialis_ (blue stem).--An important species, extending from eastern Kansas and Nebraska to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains, and from Northern Texas to the Saskatchewan; common in Montana on alkali flats and bottom lands generally. This and the preceding species were of great value to the buffalo in winter, when the shorter grasses were covered with snow. _Andropogon scoparius_ (bunch grass; broom sedge; wood-grass).--Similar to the preceding in distribution and value, but not nearly so tall. None of the buffalo grasses are found in the mountains. In the mountain regions which have been visited by the buffalo and in the Yellowstone Park, where to-day the only herd remaining in a state of nature is to be found (though not by the man with a gun), the following are the grasses which form all but a small proportion of the ruminant food: _Koeleria cristata_; _Poa tenuifolia_ (Western blue-grass); _Stipa viridula_ (feather-grass); _Stipa comata_; _Agropyrum divergens_; _Agropyrum caninum_. When pressed by hunger, the buffalo used to browse on certain species of sage-brush, particularly _Atriplex canescens_ of the Southwest. But he was discriminating in the matter of diet, and as far as can be ascertained he was never known to eat the famous and much-dreaded ""loco"" weed (_Astragalus molissimus_), which to ruminant animals is a veritable drug of madness. Domestic cattle and horses often eat this plant; where it is abundant, and become demented in consequence. VII. MENTAL CAPACITY AND DISPOSITION. (1) _Reasoning from cause to effect._--The buffalo of the past was an animal of a rather low order of intelligence, and his dullness of intellect was one of the important factors in his phenomenally swift extermination. He was provokingly slow in comprehending the existence and nature of the dangers that threatened his life, and, like the stupid brute that he was, would very often stand quietly and see two or three score, or even a hundred, of his relatives and companions shot down before his eyes, with no other feeling than one of stupid wonder and curiosity. Neither the noise nor smoke of the still-hunter's rifle, the falling, struggling, nor the final death of his companions conveyed to his mind the idea of a danger to be fled from, and so the herd stood still and allowed the still-hunter to slaughter its members at will. Like the Indian, and many white men also, the buffalo seemed to feel that their number was so great it could never be sensibly diminished. The presence of such a great multitude gave to each of its individuals a feeling of security and mutual support that is very generally found in animals who congregate in great herds. The time was when a band of elk would stand stupidly and wait for its members to be shot down one after another; but it is believed that this was due more to panic than to a lack of comprehension of danger. The fur seals who cover the ""hauling grounds"" of St. Paul and St. George Islands, Alaska, in countless thousands, have even less sense of danger and less comprehension of the slaughter of thousands of their kind, which takes place daily, than had the bison. They allow themselves to be herded and driven off landwards from the hauling-ground for half a mile to the killing-ground, and, finally, with most cheerful indifference, permit the Aleuts to club their brains out. It is to be added that whenever and wherever seals or sea-lions inhabit a given spot, with but few exceptions, it is an easy matter to approach individuals of the herd. The presence of an immense number of individuals plainly begets a feeling of security and mutual support. And let not the bison or the seal be blamed for this, for man himself exhibits the same foolish instinct. Who has not met the woman of mature years and full intellectual vigor who is mortally afraid to spend a night entirely alone in her own house, but is perfectly willing to do so, and often does do so without fear, when she can have the company of one small and helpless child, or, what is still worse, three or four of them! But with the approach of extermination, and the utter breaking up of all the herds, a complete change has been wrought in the character of the bison. At last, but alas! entirely too late, the crack of the rifle and its accompanying puff of smoke conveyed to the slow mind of the bison a sense of deadly danger to himself. At last he recognized man, whether on foot or horseback, or peering at him from a coulÃ©e, as his mortal enemy. At last he learned to run. In 1886 we found the scattered remnant of the great northern herd the wildest and most difficult animals to kill that we had ever hunted in any country. It had been only through the keenest exercise of all their powers of self-preservation that those buffaloes had survived until that late day, and we found them almost as swift as antelopes and far more wary. The instant a buffalo caught sight of a man, even though a mile distant, he was off at the top of his speed, and generally ran for some wild region several miles away. In our party was an experienced buffalo-hunter, who in three years had slaughtered over three thousand head for their hides. He declared that if he could ever catch a ""bunch"" at rest he could ""get a stand"" the same as he used to do, and kill several head before the rest would run. It so happened that the first time we found buffaloes we discovered a bunch of fourteen head, lying in the sun at noon, on the level top of a low butte, all noses pointing up the wind. We stole up within range and fired. At the instant the first shot rang out up sprang every buffalo as if he had been thrown upon his feet by steel springs, and in a second's time the whole bunch was dashing away from us with the speed of race-horses. Our buffalo-hunter declared that in chasing buffaloes we could count with certainty upon their always running against the wind, for this had always been their habit. Although this was once their habit, we soon found that those who now represent the survival of the fittest have learned better wisdom, and now run (1) away from their pursuer and (2) toward the best hiding place. Now they pay no attention whatever to the direction of the wind, and if a pursuer follows straight behind, a buffalo may change his course three or four times in a 10-mile chase. An old bull once led one of our hunters around three-quarters of a circle which had a diameter of 5 or 6 miles. The last buffaloes were mentally as capable of taking care of themselves as any animals I ever hunted. The power of original reasoning which they manifested in scattering all over a given tract of rough country, like hostile Indians when hotly pressed by soldiers, in the Indian-like manner in which they hid from sight in deep hollows, and, as we finally proved, in _grazing only in ravines and hollows_, proved conclusively that _but for the use of fire-arms_ those very buffaloes would have been actually safe from harm by man, and that they would have increased indefinitely. As they were then, the Indians' arrows and spears could never have been brought to bear upon them, save in rare instances, for they had thoroughly learned to dread man and fly from him for their lives. Could those buffaloes have been protected from rifles and revolvers the resultant race would have displayed far more active mental powers, keener vision, and finer physique than the extinguished race possessed. In fleeing from an enemy the buffalo ran against the wind, in order that his keen scent might save him from the disaster of running upon new enemies; which was an idea wholly his own, and not copied by any other animal so far as known. But it must be admitted that the buffalo of the past was very often a most stupid reasoner. He would deliberately walk into a quicksand, where hundreds of his companions were already ingulfed and in their death-struggle. He would quit feeding, run half a mile, and rush headlong into a moving train of cars that happened to come between him and the main herd on the other side of the track. He allowed himself to be impounded and slaughtered by a howling mob in a rudely constructed pen, which a combined effort on the part of three or four old bulls would have utterly demolished at any point. A herd of a thousand buffaloes would allow an armed hunter to gallop into their midst, very often within arm's-length, when any of the bulls nearest him might easily have bowled him over and had him trampled to death in a moment. The hunter who would ride in that manner into a herd of the Cape buffaloes of Africa (_Bubalus caffer_) would be unhorsed and killed before he had gone half a furlong. (2) _Curiosity._--The buffalo of the past possessed but little curiosity; he was too dull to entertain many unnecessary thoughts. Had he possessed more of this peculiar trait, which is the mark of an inquiring mind, he would much sooner have accomplished a comprehension of the dangers that proved his destruction. His stolid indifference to everything he did not understand cost him his existence, although in later years he displayed more interest in his environment. On one occasion in hunting I staked my success with an old bull I was pursuing on the chance that when he reached the crest of a ridge his curiosity would prompt him to pause an instant to look at me. Up to that moment he had had only one quick glance at me before he started to run. As he climbed the slope ahead of me, in full view, I dismounted and made ready to fire the instant he should pause to look at me. As I expected, he did come to a fall stop on the crest of the ridge, and turned half around to look at me. But for his curiosity I should have been obliged to fire at him under very serious disadvantages. (3) _Fear._--With the buffalo, fear of man is now the ruling passion. Says Colonel Dodge: ""He is as timid about his flank and rear as a raw recruit. When traveling nothing in front stops him, but an unusual object in the rear will send him to the right-about [toward the main body of the herd] at the top of his speed."" (4) _Courage._--It was very seldom that the buffalo evinced any courage save that of despair, which even cowards possess. Unconscious of his strength, his only thought was flight, and it was only when brought to bay that he was ready to fight. Now and then, however, in the chase, the buffalo turned upon his pursuer and overthrew horse and rider. Sometimes the tables were completely turned, and the hunter found his only safety in flight. During the buffalo slaughter the butchers sometimes had narrow escapes from buffaloes supposed to be dead or mortally wounded, and a story comes from the great northern range south of Glendive of a hunter who was killed by an old bull whose tongue he had actually cut out in the belief that he was dead. Sometimes buffalo cows display genuine courage in remaining with their calves in the presence of danger, although in most cases they left their offspring to their fate. During a hunt for live buffalo calves, undertaken by Mr. C. J. Jones of Garden City, Kans., in 1886, and very graphically described by a staff correspondent of the American Field in a series of articles in that journal under the title of ""The Last of the Buffalo,"" the following remarkable incident occurred:[41] [Note 41: American Field, July 24, 1886, p. 78.] ""The last calf was caught by Carter, who roped it neatly as Mr. Jones cut it out of the herd and turned it toward him. This was a fine heifer calf, and was apparently the idol of her mother's heart, for the latter came very near making a casualty the price of the capture. As soon as the calf was roped, the old cow left the herd and charged on Carter viciously, as he bent over his victim. Seeing the danger, Mr. Jones rode in at just the nick of time, and drove the cow off for a moment; but she returned again and again, and finally began charging him whenever he came near; so that, much as he regretted it, he had to shoot her with his revolver, which he did, killing her almost immediately."" The mothers of the thirteen other calves that were caught by Mr. Jones's party allowed their offspring to be ""cut out,"" lassoed, and tied, while they themselves devoted all their energies to leaving them as far behind as possible. (5) _Affection._--While the buffalo cows manifested a fair degree of affection for their young, the adult bulls of the herd often displayed a sense of responsibility for the safety of the calves that was admirable, to say the least. Those who have had opportunities for watching large herds tell us that whenever wolves approached and endeavored to reach a calf the old bulls would immediately interpose and drive the enemy away. It was a well-defined habit for the bulls to form the outer circle of every small group or section of a great herd, with the calves in the center, well guarded from the wolves, which regarded them as their most choice prey. Colonel Dodge records a remarkable incident in illustration of the manner in which the bull buffaloes protected the calves of the herd.[42] [Note 42: Plains of the Great West, p. 125.] ""The duty of protecting the calves devolved almost entirely on the bulls. I have seen evidences of this many times, but the most remarkable instance I have ever heard of was related to me by an army surgeon, who was an eye-witness. ""He was one evening returning to camp after a day's hunt, when his attention was attracted by the curious action of a little knot of six or eight buffalo. Approaching sufficiently near to see clearly, he discovered that this little knot were all bulls, standing in a close circle, with their heads outwards, while in a concentric circle at some 12 or 15 paces distant sat, licking their chaps in impatient expectancy, at least a dozen large gray wolves (excepting man, the most dangerous enemy of the buffalo). ""The doctor determined to watch the performance. After a few moments the knot broke up, and, still keeping in a compact mass, started on a trot for the main herd, some half a mile oft"". To his very great astonishment, the doctor now saw that the central and controlling figure of this mass was a poor little calf so newly born as scarcely to be able to walk. After going 50 or 100 paces the calf laid down, the bulls disposed themselves in a circle as before, and the wolves, who had trotted along on each side of their retreating supper, sat down and licked their chaps again; and though the doctor did not see the finale, it being late and the camp distant, he had no doubt that the noble fathers did their whole duty by their offspring, and carried it safely to the herd."" (6) _Temper._--I have asked many old buffalo hunters for facts in regard to the temper and disposition of herd buffaloes, and all agree that they are exceedingly quiet, peace loving, and even indolent animals at all times save during the rutting season. Says Colonel Dodge: ""The habits of the buffalo are almost identical with those of the domestic cattle. Owing either to a more pacific disposition, or to the greater number of bulls, there, is very little fighting, even at the season when it might be expected. I have been among them for days, have watched their conduct for hours at a time, and with the very best opportunities for observation, but have never seen a regular combat between bulls. They frequently strike each other with their horns, but this seems to be a mere expression of impatience at being crowded."" In referring to the ""running season"" of the buffalo, Mr. Catlin says: ""It is no uncommon thing at this season, at these gatherings, to see several thousands in a mass eddying and wheeling about under a cloud of dust, which is raised by the bulls as they are pawing in the dirt, or engaged in desperate combats, as they constantly are, plunging and butting at each other in a most furious manner."" On the whole, the disposition of the buffalo is anything but vicious. Both sexes yield with surprising readiness to the restraints of captivity, and in a remarkably short time become, if taken young, as fully domesticated as ordinary cattle. Buffalo calves are as easily tamed as domestic ones, and make very interesting pets. A prominent trait of character in the captive buffalo is a mulish obstinacy or headstrong perseverance under certain circumstances that is often very annoying. When a buffalo makes up his mind to go through a fence, he is very apt to go through, either peaceably or by force, as occasion requires. Fortunately, however, the captive animals usually accept a fence in the proper spirit, and treat it with a fair degree of respect. VIII. VALUE OF THE BUFFALO TO MAN. It may fairly be supposed that if the people of this country could have been made to realize the immense money value of the great buffalo herds as they existed in 1870, a vigorous and successful effort would have been made to regulate and restrict the slaughter. The fur seal of Alaska, of which about 100,000 are killed annually for their skins, yield an annual revenue to the Government of $100,000 and add $900,000 more to the actual wealth of the United States. It pays to protect those seals, and we mean to protect them against all comers who seek their unrestricted slaughter, no matter whether the poachers be American, English, Russian, or Canadian. It would be folly to do otherwise, and if those who would exterminate the fur seal by shooting them in the water will not desist for the telling, then they must by the compelling. The fur seal is a good investment for the United States, and their number is not diminishing. As the buffalo herds existed in 1870, 500,000 head of bulls, young and old, could have been killed every year for a score of years without sensibly diminishing the size of the herds. At a low estimate these could easily have been made to yield various products worth $5 each, as follows: Kobe, $2.50; tongue, 20 cents; meat of hindquarters, $2; bones, horns, and hoofs, 25 cents; total, $5. And the amount annually added to the wealth of the United States would have been $2,500,000. On all the robes taken for the market, say, 200,000, the Government could have collected a tax of 50 cents each, which would have yielded a sum doubly sufficient to have maintained a force of mounted police fully competent to enforce the laws regulating the slaughter. Had a contract for the protection of the buffalo been offered at $50,000 per annum, ay, or even half that sum, an army of competent men would have competed for it every year, and it could have been carried out to the letter. But, as yet, the American people have not learned to spend money for the protection of valuable game; and by the time they do learn it, there will be no game to protect. Even despite the enormous waste of raw material that ensued in the utilization of the buffalo product, the total cash value of all the material derived from this source, if it could only be reckoned up, would certainly amount to many millions of dollars--perhaps twenty millions, all told. This estimate may, to some, seem high, but when we stop to consider that in eight years, from 1876 to 1884, a single firm, that of Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz, 105 Greene street, New York, paid out the enormous sum of $923,070 (nearly one million) for robes and hides, and that in a single year (1882) another firm, that of Joseph Ullman, 165 Mercer street, New York, paid out $216,250 for robes and hides, it may not seem so incredible. Had there been a deliberate plan for the suppression of all statistics relating to the slaughter of buffalo in the United States, and what it yielded, the result could not have been more complete barrenness than exists to-day in regard to this subject. There is only one railway company which kept its books in such a manner as to show the kind and quantity of its business at that time. Excepting this, nothing is known definitely. Fortunately, enough facts and figures were recorded during the hunting operations of the Red River half-breeds to enable us, by bringing them all together, to calculate with sufficient exactitude the value of the buffalo to them from 1820 to 1840. The result ought to be of interest to all who think it is not worth while to spend money in preserving our characteristic game animals. In Ross's ""Red River Settlement,"" pp. 242-273, and Schoolcraft's ""North American Indians,"" Part iv, pp. 101-110, are given detailed accounts of the conduct and results of two hunting expeditions by the half-breeds, with many valuable statistics. On this data we base our calculation. Taking the result of one particular day's slaughter as an index to the methods of the hunters in utilizing the products of the chase, we find that while ""not less than 2,500 animals were killed,"" out of that number only 375 bags of pemmican and 240 bales of dried meat were made. ""Now,"" says Mr. Ross,"" making all due allowance for waste, 750 animals would have been ample for such a result. What, then, we might ask, became of the remaining 1,750! * * * Scarcely one-third in number of the animals killed is turned to account."" A bundle of dried meat weighs 60 to 70 pounds, and a bag of pemmican 100 to 110 pounds. If economically worked up, a whole buffalo cow yields half a bag of pemmican (about 55 pounds) and three-fourths of a bundle of dried meat (say 45 pounds). The most economical calculate that from eight to ten cows are required to load a single Red River cart. The proceeds of 1,776 cows once formed 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of dried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, each weighing 200 pounds, 556 bladders of marrow weighing 12 pounds each, and the value of the whole was $8,160. The total of the above statement is 132,057 pounds of buffalo product for 1,776 cows, or within a fraction of 75 pounds to each cow. The bulls and young animals killed were not accounted for. The expedition described by Mr. Ross contained 1,210 carts and 620 hunters, and returned with 1,089,000 pounds of meat, making 900 pounds for each cart, and 200 pounds for each individual in the expedition, of all ages and both sexes. Allowing, as already ascertained, that of the above quantity of product every 75 pounds represents one cow saved and two and one third buffaloes wasted, it means that 14,520 buffaloes were killed and utilized and 33,250 buffaloes were killed and eaten fresh or wasted, and 47,770 buffaloes were killed by 620 hunters, or an average of 77 buffaloes to each hunter. The total number of buffaloes killed for each cart was 39. Allowing, what was actually the case, that every buffalo killed would, if properly cared for, have yielded meat, fat, and robe worth at least $5, the total value of the buffaloes slaughtered by that expedition amounted to $258,850, and of which the various products actually utilized represented a cash value of $72,001 added to the wealth of the Red River half-breeds. In 1820 there went 540 carts to the buffalo plains; in 1825, 680; in 1830, 820; in 1835, 970; in 1840, 1,210. From 1820 to 1825 the average for each year was 610; from 1825 to 1830, 750; from 1830 to 1835, 895; from 1835 to 1840, 1,000. Accepting the statements of eye-witnesses that for every buffalo killed two and one-third buffaloes are wasted or eaten on the spot, and that every loaded cart represented thirty-nine dead buffaloes which were worth when utilized $5 each, we have the following series of totals: From 1820 to 1825 five expeditions, of 610 carts each, killed 118,950 buffaloes, worth $594,750. From 1825 to 1830 five expeditions, of 750 carts each, killed 146,250 buffaloes, worth $731,250. From 1830 to 1835 five expeditions, of 895 carts each, killed 174,525 buffaloes, worth $872,625. From 1835 to 1840 five expeditions, of 1,090 carts each, killed 212,550 buffaloes, worth $1,062,750. Total number of buffaloes killed in twenty years,[43] $652,275; total value of buffaloes killed in twenty years,[43] $3,261,375; total value of the product utilized[43] and added to the wealth of the settlements, $978,412. [Note 43: By the Red River half-breeds only.] The Eskimo has his seal, which yields nearly everything that he requires; the Korak of Siberia depends for his very existence upon his reindeer; the Ceylon native has the cocoa-nut palm, which leaves him little else to desire, and the North American Indian had the American, bison. If any animal was ever designed by the hand of nature for the express purpose of supplying, at one stroke, nearly all the wants of an entire race, surely the buffalo was intended for the Indian. And right well was this gift of the gods utilized by the children of nature to whom it came. Up to the time when the United States Government began to support our Western Indians by the payment of annuities and furnishing quarterly supplies of food, clothing, blankets, cloth, tents, etc., the buffalo had been the main dependence of more than 50,000 Indians who inhabited the buffalo range and its environs. Of the many different uses to which the buffalo and his various parts were, put by the red man, the following were the principal ones: The body of the buffalo yielded fresh meat, of which thousands of tons were consumed; dried meat, prepared in summer for winter use; pemmican (also prepared in summer), of meat, fat, and berries; tallow, made up into large balls or sacks, and kept in store; marrow, preserved in bladders; and tongues, dried and smoked, and eaten as a delicacy. The skin of the buffalo yielded a robe, dressed with the hair on, for clothing and bedding; a hide, dressed without the hair, which made a teepee cover, when a number were sewn together; boats, when sewn together in a green state, over a wooden framework. Shields, made from the thickest portions, as rawhide; ropes, made up as rawhide; clothing of many kinds; bags for use in traveling; coffins, or winding sheets for the dead, etc. Other portions utilized were sinews, which furnished fiber for ropes, thread, bow-strings, snow-shoe webs, etc.; hair, which was sometimes made into belts and ornaments; ""buffalo chips,"" which formed a valuable and highly-prized fuel; bones, from which many articles of use and ornament were made; horns, which were made into spoons, drinking vessels, etc. After the United States Government began to support the buffalo-hunting Indians with annuities and supplies, the woolen blanket and canvas tent took the place of the buffalo robe and the skin-covered teepee, and ""Government beef"" took the place of buffalo meat. But the slaughter of buffaloes went on just the same, and the robes and hides taken were traded for useless and often harmful luxuries, such as canned provisions, fancy knickknacks, whisky, fire-arms of the most approved pattern, and quantities of fixed ammunition. During the last ten years of the existence of the herds it is an open question whether the buffalo did not do our Indians more harm than good. Amongst the Crows, who were liberally provided for by the Government, horse racing was a common pastime, and the stakes were usually dressed buffalo robes.[44] [Note 44: On one occasion, which is doubtless still remembered with bitterness by many a Crow of the Custer Agency, my old friend Jim McNaney backed his horse Ogalalla against the horses of the whole Crow tribe. The Crows forthwith formed a pool, which consisted of a huge pile of buffalo robes, worth about $1,200, and with it backed their best race-horse. He was forthwith ""beaten out of sight"" by Ogalalla, and another grievance was registered against the whites.] The total disappearance of the buffalo has made no perceptible difference in the annual cost of the Indians to the Government. During the years when buffaloes were numerous and robes for the purchase of fire-arms and cartridges were plentiful, Indian wars were frequent, and always costly to the Government. The Indians were then quite independent, because they could take the war path at any time and live on buffalo indefinitely. Now, the case is very different. The last time Sitting Bull went on the war-path and was driven up into Manitoba, he had the doubtful pleasure of living on his ponies and dogs until he became utterly starved out. Since his last escapade, the Sioux have been compelled to admit that the game is up and the war-path is open to them no longer. Should they wish to do otherwise they know that they could survive only by killing cattle, and cattle that are guarded by cowboys and ranchmen are no man's game. Therefore, while we no longer have to pay for an annual campaign in force against hostile Indians, the total absence of the buffalo brings upon the nation the entire support of the Indian, and the cash outlay each year is as great as ever. The value of the American bison to civilized man can never be calculated, nor even fairly estimated. It may with safety be said, however, that it has been probably tenfold greater than most persons have ever supposed. It would be a work of years to gather statistics of the immense bulk of robes and hides, undoubtedly amounting to millions in the aggregate; the thousands of tons of meat, and the train-loads of bones which have been actually utilized by man. Nor can the effect of the bison's presence upon the general development of the great West ever be calculated. It has sunk into the great sum total of our progress, and well nigh lost to sight forever. As a mere suggestion of the immense value of ""the buffalo product"" at the time when it had an existence, I have obtained from two of our leading fur houses in New York City, with branches elsewhere, a detailed statement of their business in buffalo robes and hides during the last few years of the trade. They not only serve to show the great value of the share of the annual crop that passed through their hands, but that of Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz is of especial value, because, being carefully itemized throughout, it shows the decline and final failure of the trade in exact figures. I am under many obligations to both these firms for their kindness in furnishing the facts I desired, and especially to the Messrs. Boskowitz, who devoted considerable time and labor to the careful compilation of the annexed statement of their business in buffalo skins. _Memorandum of buffalo robes and hides bought by Messrs J. & A. Boskowitz, 101-105 Greene Street, New York, and 202 Lake street, Chicago, from 1876 to 1884._ +----------------------------------------+ |Year | Buffalo robes. | Buffalo hides. | | |Number.| Cost. | Number.|Cost. | +-----+-------+---------+--------+-------+ |1876 | 31,838| $39,620| None.| ... | |1877 | 9,353| 35,560| None.| ... | |1878 | 41,268| 150,600| None.| ... | |1879 | 28,613| 110,420| None.| ... | |1880 | 34,901| 176,200| 4,570|$13,140| |1881 | 23,355| 151,800| 26,601| 89,030| |1882 | 2,124| 15,600| 15,464| 44,140| |1883 | 6,690| 29,770| 21,869| 67,190| |1884 | None.| ...| 529| 1,720| +-----+-------+---------+--------+-------+ |Total|177,142|$709,570 | 69,033|215,220| +----------------------------------------+ Total number of buffalo skins handled in nine years, 246,175; total cost, $924,790. I have also been favored with some very interesting facts and figures regarding the business done in buffalo skins by the firm of Mr. Joseph Ullman, exporter and importer of furs and robes, of 165-107 Mercer street, New York, and also 353 Jackson street, St. Paul, Minnesota. The following letter was written me by Mr. Joseph Ullman on November 12, 1887, for which I am greatly indebted: ""Inasmuch as you particularly desire the figures for the years 1880-'86, I have gone through my buffalo robe and hide accounts of those years, and herewith give you approximate figures, as there are a good many things to be considered which make it difficult to give exact figures. ""In 1881 we handled about 14,000 hides, average cost about $3.50, and 12,000 robes, average cost about $7.50. ""In 1882 we purchased between 35,000 and 40,000 hides, at an average cost of about $3.50, and about 10,000 robes, at an average cost of about $8.50. ""In 1883 we purchased from 6,000 to 7,000 hides and about 1,500 to 2,000 robes at a slight advance in price against the year previous. ""In 1884 we purchased less than 2,500 hides, and in my opinion these were such as were carried over from the previous season in the Northwest, and were not fresh-slaughtered skins. The collection of robes this season was also comparatively small, and nominally robes carried over from 1883. ""In 1885 the collection of hides amounted to little or nothing. ""The aforesaid goods were all purchased direct in the Northwest, that is to say, principally in Montana, and shipped in care of our branch house at St. Paul, Minnesota, to Joseph Ullman, Chicago. The robes mentioned above were Indian-tanned robes and were mainly disposed of to the jobbing trade both East and West. ""In 1881 and the years prior, the hides were divided into two kinds, viz, robe hides, which were such as had a good crop of fur and were serviceable for robe purposes, and the heavy and short-furred bull hides. The former were principally sold to the John S. Way Manufacturing Company, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and to numerous small robe tanners, while the latter were sold for leather purposes to various hide-tanners throughout the United States and Canada, and brought 51/2 to 81/2 cents per pound. A very large proportion of these latter were tanned by the Wilcox Tanning Company, Wilcox, Pennsylvania. ""About the fall of 1882 we established a tannery for buffalo robes in Chicago, and from that time forth we tanned all the good hides which we received into robes and disposed of them in the same manner as the Indian-tanned robes. ""I don't know that I am called upon to express an opinion as to the benefit or disadvantage of the extermination of the buffalo, but nevertheless take the liberty to say that I think that some proper law restricting the unpardonable slaughter of the buffalo should have been enacted at the time. It is a well-known fact that soon after the Northern Pacific Railroad opened up that portion of the country, thereby making the transportation of the buffalo hides feasible, that is to say, reducing the cost of freight, thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed for the sake of the hide alone, while the carcasses were left to rot on the open plains. ""The average prices paid the buffalo hunters [from 1880 to 1884] was about as follows: For cow hides [robes!], $3; bull hides, $2.50; yearlings, $1.50; calves, 75 cents; and the cost of getting the hides to market brought the cost up to about $3.50 per hide."" The amount actually paid out by Joseph Ullman, in four years, for buffalo robes and hides was about $310,000, and this, too, long after the great southern herd had ceased to exist, and when the northern herd furnished the sole supply. It thus appears that during the course of eight years business (leaving out the small sum paid out in 1884), on the part of the Messrs. Boskowitz, and four years on that of Mr. Joseph Ullman, these two firms alone paid out the enormous sum of $1,233,070 for buffalo robes and hides which they purchased to sell again at a good profit. By the time their share of the buffalo product reached the consumers it must have represented an actual money value of about $2,000,000. Besides these two firms there were at that time many others who also handled great quantities of buffalo skins and hides for which they paid out immense sums of money. In this country the other leading firms engaged in this business were I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton; P. B. Weare & Co., Chicago; Obern, Hoosick & Co., Chicago and Saint Paul; Martin Bates & Co., and Messrs. Shearer, Nichols & Co. (now Hurlburt, Shearer & Sanford), of New York. There were also many others whose names I am now unable to recall. In the British Possessions and Canada the frontier business was largely monopolized by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, although the annual ""output"" of robes and hides was but small in comparison with that gathered in the United States, where the herds were far more numerous. Even in their most fruitful locality for robes--the country south of the Saskatchewan--this company had a very powerful competitor in the firm of I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, which secured the lion's share of the spoil and sent it down the Missouri River. It is quite certain that the utilization of the buffalo product, even so far as it was accomplished, resulted in the addition of several millions of dollars to the wealth of the people of the United States. That the total sum, could it be reckoned up, would amount to at least fifteen millions, seems reasonably certain; and my own impression is that twenty millions would be nearer the mark. It is much to be regretted that the exact truth can never be known, for in this age of universal slaughter a knowledge of the cash value of the wild game of the United States that has been killed up to date might go far toward bringing about the actual as well as the theoretical protection of what remains. * * * * * UTILIZATION OF THE BUFFALO BY WHITE MEN. _Robes._--Ordinarily the skin of a large ruminant is of little value in comparison with the bulk of toothsome flesh it covers. In fattening domestic cattle for the market, the value of the hide is so insignificant that it amounts to no more than a butcher's perquisite in reckoning up the value of the animal. With the buffalo, however, so enormous was the waste of the really available product that probably nine-tenths of the total value derived from the slaughter of the animal came from his skin alone. Of this, about four-fifths came from the utilization of the furry robe and one-fifth from skins classed as ""hides,"" which were either taken in the summer season, when the hair was very short or almost absent, and used for the manufacture of leather and leather goods, or else were the poorly-furred skins of old bulls. The season for robe-taking was from October 15 to February 15, and a little later in the more northern latitudes. In the United States the hair of the buffalo was still rather short up to the first of November; but by the middle of November it was about at its finest as to length, density, color, and freshness. The Montana hunters considered that the finest robes were those taken from November 15 to December 15. Before the former date the hair had not quite attained perfection in length, and after the latter it began to show wear and lose color. The winter storms of December and January began to leave their mark upon the robes by the 1st of February, chiefly by giving the hair a bleached and weathered appearance. By the middle of February the pelage was decidedly on the wane, and the robe-hunter was also losing his energy. Often, however, the hunt was kept up until the middle of March, until either the deterioration of the quality of the robe, the migration of the herds northward, or the hunter's longing to return ""to town"" and ""clean up,"" brought the hunt to an end. On the northern buffalo range, the hunter, or ""buffalo skinner,"" removed the robe in the following manner: When the operator had to do his work alone, which was almost always the case, he made haste to skin his victims while they were yet warm, if possible, and before _rigor mortis_ had set in; but, at all hazards, before they should become hard frozen. With a warm buffalo he could easily do his work single-handed, but with one rigid or frozen stiff it was a very different matter. His first act was to heave the carcass over until it lay fairly upon its back, with its feet up in the air. To keep it in that position he wrenched the head violently around to one side, close against the shoulder, at the point where the hump was highest and the tendency to roll the greatest, and used it very effectually as a chock to keep the body from rolling back upon its side. Having fixed the carcass in position he drew forth his steel, sharpened his sharp-pointed ""ripping-knife,"" and at once proceeded to make all the opening cuts in the skin. Each leg was girdled to the bone, about 8 inches above the hoof, and the skin of the leg ripped open from that point along the inside to the median line of the body. A long, straight cut was then made along the middle of the breast and abdomen, from the root of the tail to the chin. In skinning cows and young animals, nothing but the skin of the forehead and nose was left on the skull, the skin of the throat and cheeks being left on the hide; but in skinning old bulls, on whose heads the skin was very thick and tough, the whole head was left unskinned, to save labor and time. The skin of the neck was severed in a circle around the neck, just behind the ears. It is these huge heads of bushy brown hair, looking, at a little distance, quite black, in sharp contrast with the ghastly whiteness of the perfect skeletons behind them, which gives such a weird and ghostly appearance to the lifeless prairies of Montana where the bone-gatherer has not yet done his perfect work. The skulls of the cows and young buffaloes are as clean and bare as if they had been carefully macerated, and bleached by a skilled osteologist. [Illustration: FIG. 1. A DEAD BULL. From a photograph by L. A. Huffman.] [Illustration: FIG. 2. BUFFALO SKINNERS AT WORK. From a photograph by L. A. Huffman.] The opening cuts having been made, the broad-pointed ""skinning-knife"" was duly sharpened, and with it the operator fell to work to detach the skin from the body in the shortest possible time. The tail was always skinned and left on the hide. As soon as the skin was taken off it was spread out on a clean, smooth, and level spot of ground, and stretched to its fullest extent, inside uppermost. On the northern range, very few skins were ""pegged out,"" _i. e._, stretched thoroughly and held by means of wooden pegs driven through the edges of the skin into the earth. It was practiced to a limited extent on the southern range during the latter part of the great slaughter, when buffaloes were scarce and time abundant. Ordinarily, however, there was no time for pegging, nor were pegs available on the range to do the work with. A warm skin stretched on the curly buffalo-grass, hair side down, sticks to the ground of itself until it has ample time to harden. On the northern range the skinner always cut the initials of his outfit in the thin subcutaneous muscle which was always found adhering to the skin on each side, and which made a permanent and very plain mark of ownership. In the south, the traders who bought buffalo robes on the range sometimes rigged up a rude press, with four upright posts and a huge lever, in which robes that had been folded into a convenient size were pressed into bales, like bales of cotton. These could be transported by wagon much more economically than could loose robes. An illustration of this process is given in an article by Theodore R. Davis, entitled ""The Buffalo Range,"" in _Harper's Magazine_ for January, 1869, Vol. xxxviii, p. 163. The author describes the process as follows: ""As the robes are secured, the trader has them arranged in lots of ten each, with but little regard for quality other than some care that particularly fine robes do not go too many in one lot. These piles are then pressed into a compact bale by means of a rudely constructed affair composed of saplings and a chain."" On the northern range, skins were not folded until the time came to haul them in. Then the hunter repaired to the scene of his winter's work, with a wagon surmounted by a hay-rack (or something like it), usually drawn by four horses. As the skins were gathered up they were folded once, lengthwise down the middle, with the hair inside. Sometimes as many as 100 skins were hauled at one load by four horses. On one portion of the northern range the classification of buffalo peltries was substantially as follows: Under the head _of robes_ was included all cow skins taken during the proper season, from one year old upward, and all bull skins from one to three years old. Bull skins over three years of age were classed as _hides_, and while the best of them were finally tanned and used as robes, the really poor ones were converted into leather. The large robes, when tanned, were used very generally throughout the colder portions of North America as sleigh robes and wraps, and for bedding in the regions of extreme cold. The small robes, from the young animals, and likewise many large robes, were made into overcoats, at once the warmest and the most cumbersome that ever enveloped a human being. Thousands of old bull robes were tanned with the hair on, and the body portions were made into overshoes, with the woolly hair inside--absurdly large and uncouth, but very warm. I never wore a pair of buffalo overshoes without being torn by conflicting emotions--mortification at the ridiculous size of my combined foot-gear, big boots inside of huge overshoes, and supreme comfort derived from feet that were always warm. Besides the ordinary robe, the hunters and fur buyers of Montana recognized four special qualities, as follows: The ""beaver robe,"" with exceedingly fine, wavy fur, the color of a beaver, and having long, coarse, straight hairs coming through it. The latter were of course plucked out in the process of manufacture. These were very rare. In 1882 Mr. James McNaney took one, a cow robe, the only one out of 1,200 robes taken that season, and sold it for $75, when ordinary robes fetched only $3.50. The ""black-and-tan robe"" is described as having the nose, flanks, and inside of fore legs black-and-tan (whatever that may mean), while the remainder of the robe is jet black. A ""buckskin robe"" is from what is always called a ""white buffalo,"" and is in reality a dirty cream color instead of white. A robe of this character sold in Miles City in 1882 for $200, and was the only one of that character taken on the northern range during that entire winter. A very few pure white robes have been taken, so I have been told, chiefly by Indians, but I have never seen one. A ""blue robe"" or ""mouse-colored (?) robe"" is one on which the body color shows a decidedly bluish cast, and at the same time has long, fine fur. Out of his 1,200 robes taken in 1882, Mr. McNaney picked out 12 which passed muster as the much sought for blue robes, and they sold at $16 each. As already intimated, the price paid on the range for ordinary buffalo skins varied according to circumstances, and at different periods, and in different localities, ranged all the way from 65 cents to $10. The latter figure was paid in Texas in 1887 for the last lot of ""robes"" ever taken. The lowest prices ever paid were during the tremendous slaughter which annihilated the southern herd. Even as late as 1876, in the southern country, cow robes brought on the range only from 65 to 90 cents, and bull robes $1.15. On the northern range, from 1881 to 1883, the prices paid were much higher, ranging from $2.50 to $4. [Illustration: FIG. 1. FIVE MINUTES' WORK. Photographed by L. A. Huffman.] [Illustration: FIG. 2. SCENE ON THE NORTHERN BUFFALO RANGE. Photographed by L. A. Huffman.] A few hundred dressed robes still remain in the hands of some of the largest fur dealers in New York, Chicago, and Montreal, which can be purchased at prices much lower than one would expect, considering the circumstances. In 1888, good robes, Indian tanned, were offered in New York at prices ranging from $15 to $30, according to size and quality, but in Montreal no first-class robes were obtainable at less than $40. _Hides._--Next in importance to robes was the class of skins known commercially as hides. Under this head were classed all skins which for any reason did not possess the pelage necessary to a robe, and were therefore fit only for conversion into leather. Of these, the greater portion consisted of the skins of old bulls on which the hair was of poor quality and the skin itself too thick and heavy to ever allow of its being made into a soft, pliable, and light-weight robe. The remaining portion of the hides marketed were from buffaloes killed in spring and summer, when the body and hindquarters ware almost naked. Apparently the quantity of summer-killed hides marketed was not very great, for it was only the meanest and most unprincipled ones of the grand army of buffalo-killers who were mean enough to kill buffaloes in summer simply for their hides. It is said that at one time summer-killing was practiced on the southern range to an extent that became a cause for alarm to the great body of more respectable hunters, and the practice was frowned upon so severely that the wretches who engaged in it found it wise to abandon it. _Bones._--Next in importance to robes and hides was the bone product, the utilization of which was rendered possible by the rigorous climate of the buffalo plains. Under the influence of the wind and sun and the extremes of heat and cold, the flesh remaining upon a carcass dried up, disintegrated, and fell to dust, leaving the bones of almost the entire skeleton as clean and bare as if they had been stripped of flesh by some powerful chemical process. Very naturally, no sooner did the live buffaloes begin to grow scarce than the miles of bleaching' bones suggested the idea of finding a use for them. A market was readily found for them in the East, and the prices paid per ton were sufficient to make the business of bone-gathering quite remunerative. The bulk of the bone product was converted into phosphate for fertilizing purposes, but much of it was turned into carbon for use in the refining of sugar. The gathering of bones became a common industry as early as 1872, during which year 1,135,300 pounds were shipped over the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad. In the year following the same road shipped 2,743,100 pounds, and in 1874 it handled 6,914,950 pounds more. This trade continued from that time on until the plains have been gleaned so far back from the railway lines that it is no longer profitable to seek them. For that matter, however, it is said that south of the Union Pacific nothing worth the seeking now remains. The building of the Northern Pacific Railway made possible the shipment of immense quantities of dry bones. Even as late as 1886 overland travelers saw at many of the stations between Jamestown, Dakota, and Billings, Montana, immense heaps of bones lying alongside the track awaiting shipment. In 1885 a single firm shipped over 200 tons of bones from Miles City. The valley of the Missouri River was gleaned by teamsters who gathered bones from as far back as 100 miles and hauled them to the river for shipment on the steamers. An operator who had eight wagons in the business informed me that in order to ship bones on the river steamers it was necessary to crush them, and that for crushed bones, shipped in bags, a Michigan fertilizer company paid $18 per ton. Uncrushed bones, shipped by the railway, sold for $12 per ton. It is impossible to ascertain the total amount or value of the bone product, but it is certain that it amounted to many thousand tons, and in value must have amounted to some hundreds of thousands of dollars. But for the great number of railroads, river steamers, and sea-going vessels (from Texas ports) engaged in carrying this product, it would have cut an important figure in the commerce of the country, but owing to the many interests between which it was divided it attracted little attention. _Meat._--The amount of fresh buffalo meat cured and marketed was really very insignificant. So long as it was to be had at all it was so very abundant that it was worth only from 2 to 3 cents per pound in the market, and many reasons combined to render the trade in fresh buffalo meat anything but profitable. Probably not more than one one-thousandth of the buffalo meat that might have been saved and utilized was saved. The buffalo carcasses that were wasted on the great plains every year during the two great periods of slaughter (of the northern and southern herds) would probably have fed to satiety during the entire time more than a million persons. As to the quality of buffalo meat, it may be stated in general terms that it differs in no way whatever from domestic beef of the same age produced by the same kind of grass. Perhaps there is no finer grazing ground in the world than Montana, and the beef it produces is certainly entitled to rank with the best. There are many persons who claim to recognize a difference between the taste of buffalo meat and domestic beef; but for my part I do not believe any difference really exists, unless it is that the flesh of the buffalo is a little sweeter and more juicy. As for myself, I feel certain I could not tell the difference between the flesh of a three-year old buffalo and that of a domestic beef of the same age, nor do I believe any one else could, even on a wager. Having once seen a butcher eat an elephant steak in the belief that it was beef from his own shop, and another butcher eat _loggerhead turtle_ steak for beef, I have become somewhat skeptical in regard to the intelligence of the human palate. As a matter of experiment, during our hunt for buffalo we had buffalo meat of all ages, from one year up to eleven, cooked in as many different ways as our culinary department could turn out. We had it broiled, fried with batter, roasted, boiled, and stewed. The last method, when employed upon slices of meat that had been hacked from a frozen hind-quarter, produced results that were undeniably tough and not particularly good. But it was an unfair way to cook any kind of meat, and may be guarantied to spoil the finest beef in the world. Hump meat from a cow buffalo not too old, cut in slices and fried in batter, _a la cowboy_, is delicious--a dish fit for the gods. We had tongues in plenty, but the ordinary meat was so good they were not half appreciated. Of course the tenderloin was above criticism, and even the round steaks, so lightly esteemed by the epicure, were tender and juicy to a most satisfactory degree. It has been said that the meat of the buffalo has a coarser texture or ""grain"" than domestic beef. Although I expected to find such to be the case, I found no perceptible difference whatever, nor do I believe that any exists. As to the distribution of fat I am unable to say, for the reason that our buffaloes were not fat. It is highly probable that the distribution of fat through the meat, so characteristic of the shorthorn breeds, and which has been brought about only by careful breeding, is not found in either the beef of the buffalo or common range cattle. In this respect, shorthorn beef no doubt surpasses both the others mentioned, but in all other points, texture, flavor, and general tenderness, I am very sure it does not. It is a great mistake for a traveler to kill a patriarchal old bull buffalo, and after attempting to masticate a small portion of him to rise up and declare that buffalo meat is coarse, tough, and dry. A domestic bull of the same age would taste as tough. It is probably only those who have had the bad taste to eat bull-beef who have ever found occasion to asperse the reputation of _Bison americanus_ as a beef animal. Until people got tired of them, buffalo tongues were in considerable demand, and hundreds, if not even thousands, of barrels of them were shipped east from the buffalo country. _Pemmican._--Out of the enormous waste of good buffalo flesh one product stands forth as a redeeming feature--pemmican. Although made almost exclusively by the half-breeds and Indians of the Northwest it constituted a regular article of commerce of great value to overland travelers, and was much sought for as long as it was produced. Its peculiar ""staying powers,"" due to the process of its manufacture, which yielded a most nourishing food in a highly condensed form, made it of inestimable value to the overland traveler who must travel light or not at all. A handful of pemmican was sufficient food to constitute a meal when provisions were at all scarce. The price of pemmican in Winnipeg was once as low as 2d. per pound, but in 1883 a very small quantity which was brought in sold at 10 cents per pound. This was probably the last buffalo pemmican made. H. M. Robinson states that in 1878 pemmican was worth 1s. 3d. per pound. The manufacture of pemmican, as performed by the Red River half-breeds, was thus described by the Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Catholic priest, who once accompanied one of the great buffalo-hunting expeditions:[45] [Note 45: Schoolcraft's History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes, iv, p. 107.] ""Other portions which are destined to be made into pimikehigan, or pemmican, are exposed to an ardent heat, and thus become brittle and easily reducible to small particles by the use of a flail, the buffalo-hide answering the purpose of a threshing-floor. The fat or tallow, being cut up and melted in large kettles of sheet iron, is poured upon this pounded meat, and the whole mass is worked together with shovels until it is well amalgamated, when it is pressed, while still warm, into bags made of buffalo skin, which are strongly sewed up, and the mixture gradually cools and becomes almost as hard as a rock. If the fat used in this process is that taken from the parts containing the udder, the meat is called fine pemmican. In some cases, dried fruits, such as the prairie pear and cherry, are intermixed, which forms what is called seed pemmican. Tho lovers of good eating judge the first described to be very palatable; the second, better; the third, excellent. A taurean of pemmican weighs from 100 to 110 pounds. Some idea may be formed of the immense destruction of buffalo by these people when it is stated that a whole cow yields one-half a bag of pemmican and three fourths of a bundle of dried meat; so that the most economical calculate that from eight to ten cows are required for the load of a single vehicle."" It is quite evident from the testimony of disinterested travelers that ordinary pemmican was not very palatable to one unaccustomed to it as a regular article of food. To the natives, however, especially the Canadian _voyageur_, it formed one of the most valuable food products of the country, and it is said that the demand for it was generally greater than the supply. _Dried, or ""jerked"" meat._--The most popular and universal method of curing buffalo meat was to cut it into thin flakes, an inch or less in thickness and of indefinite length, and without salting it in the least to hang it over poles, ropes, wicker-frames, or even clumps of standing sage brush, and let it dry in the sun. This process yielded the famous ""jerked"" meat so common throughout the West in the early days, from the Rio Grande to the Saskatchewan. Father Belcourt thus described the curing process as it was practiced by the half-breeds and Indians of the Northwest: ""The meat, when taken to camp, is cut by the women into long strips about a quarter of an inch thick, which are hung upon the lattice-work prepared for that purpose to dry. This lattice-work is formed of small pieces of wood, placed horizontally, transversely, and equidistant from each other, not unlike an immense gridiron, and is supported by wooden uprights (trepieds). In a few days the meat is thoroughly desiccated, when it is bent into proper lengths and tied into bundles of 60 or 70 pounds weight. This is called dried meat (viande seche). To make the hide into parchment (so called) it is stretched on a frame, and then scraped on the inside with a piece of sharpened bone and on the outside with a small but sharp-curved iron, proper to remove the hair. This is considered, likewise, the appropriate labor of women. The men break the bones, which are boiled in water to extract the marrow to be used for frying and other culinary purposes. The oil is then poured into the bladder of the animal, which contains, when filled, about 12 pounds, being the yield of the marrow-bones of two buffaloes."" In the Northwest Territories dried meat, which formerly sold at 2_d._ per pound, was worth in 1878 10_d._ per pound. Although I have myself prepared quite a quantity of jerked buffalo meat, I never learned to like it. Owing to the absence of salt in its curing, the dried meat when pounded and made into a stew has a ""far away"" taste which continually reminds one of hoofs and horns. For all that, and despite its resemblance in flavor to Liebig's Extract of Beef, it is quite good, and better to the taste than ordinary pemmican. The Indians formerly cured great quantities of buffalo meat in this way--in summer, of course, for use in winter--but the advent of that popular institution called ""Government beef"" long ago rendered it unnecessary for the noble red man to exert his squaw in that once honorable field of labor. During the existence of the buffalo herds a few thrifty and enterprising white men made a business of killing buffaloes in summer and drying the meat in bulk, in the same manner which to-day produces our popular ""dried beef."" Mr. Allen states that ""a single hunter at Hays City shipped annually for some years several hundred barrels thus prepared, which the consumers probably bought for ordinary beef."" _Uses of bison's hair._--Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the woolly hair of the bison in the manufacture of textile fabrics. As early as 1729 Col. William Byrd records the fact that garments were made of this material, as follows: ""The Hair growing upon his Head and Neck is long and Shagged, and so Soft that it will spin into Thread not unlike Mohair, and might be wove into a sort of Camlet. Some People have Stockings knit of it, that would have served an Israelite during his forty Years march thro' the Wilderness.""[46] [Note 46: Westover MSS., i, p. 172.] In 1637 Thomas Morton published, in his ""New English Canaan,"" p. 98,[47] the following reference to the Indians who live on the southern shore of Lake Erocoise, supposed to be Lake Ontario: [Note 47: Quoted by Professor Allen, ""American Bisons,"" p. 107.] ""These Beasts [buffaloes, undoubtedly] are of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their hides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, being a kind of wolle, as fine as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make garments thereof."" Professor Allen quotes a number of authorities who have recorded statements in regard to the manufacture of belts, garters, scarfs, sacks, etc., from buffalo wool by various tribes of Indians.[48] He also calls attention to the only determined efforts ever made by white men on a liberal scale for the utilization of buffalo ""wool"" and its manufacture into cloth, an account of which appears in Ross's ""Red River Settlement,"" pp. 69-72. In 1821 some of the more enterprising of the Red River (British) colonists conceived the idea of making fortunes out of the manufacture of woolen goods from the fleece of the buffalo, and for that purpose organized the Buffalo Wool Company, the principal object of which was declared to be ""to provide a substitute for wool, which substitute was to be the wool of the wild buffalo, which was to be collected in the plains and manufactured both for the use of the colonists and for export."" A large number of skilled workmen of various kinds were procured from England, and also a plant of machinery and materials. When too late, it was found that the supply of buffalo wool obtainable was utterly insufficient, the raw wool costing the company 1_s._ 6_d._ per pound, and cloth which it cost the company Â£2 10_s._ per yard to produce was worth only 4_s._ 6_d._ per yard in England. The historian states that universal drunkenness on the part of all concerned aided very materially in bringing about the total failure of the enterprise in a very short time. [Note 48: The American Bison, p. 197.] While it is possible to manufacture the fine, woolly fur of the bison into cloth or knitted garments, provided a sufficient supply of the raw material could be obtained (which is and always has been impossible), nothing could be more visionary than an attempt to thus produce salable garments at a profit. Articles of wearing apparel made of buffalo's hair are interesting as curiosities, for their rarity makes them so, but that is the only end they can ever serve so long as there is a sheep living. In the National Museum, in the section of animal products, there is displayed a pair of stockings made in Canada from the finest buffalo wool, from the body of the animal. They are thick, heavy, and full of the coarse, straight hairs, which it seems can never be entirely separated from the fine wool. In general texture they are as coarse as the coarsest sheep's wool would produce. With the above are also displayed a rope-like lariat, made by the Comanche Indians, and a smaller braided lasso, seemingly a sample more than a full-grown lariat, made by the Otoe Indians of Nebraska. Both of the above are made of the long, dark-brown hair of the head and shoulders, and in spite of the fact that they have been twisted as hard as possible, the ends of the hairs protrude so persistently that the surface of each rope is extremely hairy. _Buffalo chips._--Last, but by no means least in value to the traveler on the treeless plains, are the droppings of the buffalo, universally known as ""buffalo chips."" When over one year old and thoroughly dry, this material makes excellent fuel. Usually it occurs only where fire-wood is unobtainable, and thousands of frontiersmen have a million times found it of priceless value. When dry, it catches easily, burns readily, and makes a hot fire with but very little smoke, although it is rapidly consumed. Although not as good for a fire as even the poorest timber it is infinitely better than sage-brush, which, in the absence of chips, is often the traveler's last resort. It usually happens that chips are most-abundant in the sheltered creek-bottoms and near the water-holes, the very situations which travelers naturally select for their camps. In these spots the herds have gathered either for shelter in winter or for water in summer, and remained in a body for some hours. And now, when the cowboy on the round-up, the surveyor, or hunter, who must camp out, pitches his tent in the grassy coulÃ©e or narrow creek-bottom, his first care is to start out with his largest gunning bag to ""rustle some buffalo chips"" for a campfire. He, at least, when he returns well laden with the spoil of his humble chase, still has good reason to remember the departed herd with feelings of gratitude. Thus even the last remains of this most useful animal are utilized by man in providing for his own imperative wants. IX. THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE BISON TO CATTLE-GROWERS. _The bison in captivity and domestication._--Almost from time immemorial it has been known that the American bison takes kindly to captivity, herds contentedly with domestic cattle, and crosses with them with the utmost readiness. It was formerly believed, and indeed the tradition prevails even now to quite an extent, that on account of the hump on the shoulders a domestic cow could not give birth to a half-breed calf. This belief is entirely without foundation, and is due to theories rather than facts. Numerous experiments in buffalo breeding have been made, and the subject is far from being a new one. As early as 1701 the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, on the James River, a few miles above Richmond, began to domesticate buffaloes. It is also a matter of historical record that in 1786, or thereabouts, buffaloes were domesticated and bred in captivity in Virginia, and Albert Gallatin states that in some of the northwestern counties the mixed breed was quite common. In 1815 a series of elaborate and valuable experiments in cross-breeding the buffalo and domestic cattle was begun by Mr. Robert Wickliffe, of Lexington, Ky., and continued by him for upwards of thirty years.[49] [Note 49: For a full account of Mr. Wickliffe's experiments, written by himself, see Audubon and Bachman's ""Quadrupeds of North America,"" vol. ii, pp. 52-54.] Quite recently the buffalo-breeding operations of Mr. S. L. Bedson, of Stony Mountain, Manitoba, and Mr. C. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., have attracted much attention, particularly for the reason that the efforts of both these gentlemen have been directed toward the practical improvement of the present breeds of range cattle. For this reason the importance of the work in which they are engaged can hardly be overestimated, and the results already obtained by Mr. Bedson, whose experiments antedate those of Mr. Jones by several years, are of the greatest interest to western cattle-growers. Indeed, unless the stock of pure-blood buffaloes now remaining proves insufficient for the purpose, I fully believe that we will gradually see a great change wrought in the character of western cattle by the introduction of a strain of buffalo blood. The experiments which have been made thus far prove conclusively that-- (1) The male bison crosses readily with the opposite sex of domestic cattle, but a buffalo cow has never been known to produce a half-breed calf. (2) The domestic cow produces a half-breed calf successfully. (3) The progeny of the two species is fertile to any extent, yielding half-breeds, quarter, three-quarter breeds, and so on. (4) The bison breeds in captivity with perfect regularity and success. _Need of an improvement in range cattle._--Ever since the earliest days of cattle-ranching in the West, stockmen have had it in their power to produce a breed which would equal in beef-bearing qualities the best breeds to be found upon the plains, and be so much better calculated to survive the hardships of winter, that their annual losses would have been very greatly reduced. Whenever there is an unusually severe winter, such as comes about three times in every decade, if not even oftener, range cattle perish by thousands. It is an absolute impossibility for every ranchman who owns several thousand, or even several hundred, head of cattle to provide hay for them, even during the severest portion of the winter season, and consequently the cattle must depend wholly upon their own resources. When the winter is reasonably mild, and the snows never very deep, nor lying too long at a time on the ground, the cattle live through the winter with very satisfactory success. Thanks to the wind, it usually happens that the falling snow is blown off the ridges as fast as it falls, leaving the grass sufficiently uncovered for the cattle to feed upon it. If the snow-fall is universal, but not more than a few inches in depth, the cattle paw through it here and there, and eke out a subsistence, on quarter rations it may be, until a friendly chinook wind sets in from the southwest and dissolves the snow as if by magic in a few hours' time. But when a deep snow comes, and lies on the ground persistently, week in and week out, when the warmth of the sun softens and moistens its surface sufficiently for a returning cold wave to freeze it into a hard crust, forming a universal wall of ice between the luckless steer and his only food, the cattle starve and freeze in immense numbers. Being totally unfitted by nature to survive such unnatural conditions, it is not strange that they succumb. Under present conditions the stockman simply stakes his cattle against the winter elements and takes his chances on the results, which are governed by circumstances wholly beyond his control. The losses of the fearful winter of 1886-'87 will probably never be forgotten by the cattlemen of the great Western grazing ground. In many portions of Montana and Wyoming the cattlemen admitted a loss of 50 per cent of their cattle, and in some localities the loss was still greater. The same conditions are liable to prevail next winter, or any succeeding winter, and we may yet see more than half the range cattle in the West perish in a single month. Yet all this time the cattlemen have had it in their power, by the easiest and simplest method in the world, to introduce a strain of hardy native blood in their stock which would have made it capable of successfully resisting a much greater degree of hunger and cold. It is really surprising that the desirability of cross-breeding the buffalo and domestic cattle should for so long a time have been either overlooked or disregarded. While cattle-growers generally have shown the greatest enterprise in producing special breeds for milk, for butter, or for beef, cattle with short horns and cattle with no horns at all, only two or three men have had the enterprise to try to produce a breed particularly hardy and capable. A buffalo can weather storms and outlive hunger and cold which would kill any domestic steer that ever lived. When nature placed him on the treeless and blizzard-swept plains, she left him well equipped to survive whatever natural conditions he would have to encounter. The most striking feature of his entire _tout ensemble_ is his magnificent suit of hair and fur combined, the warmest covering possessed by any quadruped save the musk-ox. The head, neck, and fore quarters are clothed with hide and hair so thick as to be almost, if not entirely, impervious to cold. The hair on the body and hind quarters is long, fine, very thick, and of that peculiar woolly quality which constitutes the best possible protection against cold. Let him who doubts the warmth of a good buffalo robe try to weather a blizzard with something else, and then try the robe. The very form of the buffalo--short, thick legs, and head hung very near the ground--suggests most forcibly a special fitness to wrestle with mother earth for a living, snow or no snow. A buffalo will flounder for days through deep snow-drifts without a morsel of food, and survive where the best range steer would literally freeze on foot, bolt upright, as hundreds did in the winter of 1886-'87. While range cattle turn tail to a blizzard and drift helplessly, the buffalo faces it every time, and remains master of the situation. It has for years been a surprise to me that Western stockmen have not seized upon the opportunity presented by the presence of the buffalo to improve the character of their cattle. Now that there are no longer any buffalo calves to be had on the plains for the trouble of catching them, and the few domesticated buffaloes that remain are worth fabulous prices, we may expect to see a great deal of interest manifested in this subject, and some costly efforts made to atone for previous lack of forethought. _The character of the buffalo-domestic hybrid._--The subjoined illustration from a photograph kindly furnished by Mr. C. J. Jones, represents a ten months' old half-breed calf (male), the product of a buffalo bull and domestic cow. The prepotency of the sire is apparent at the first glance, and to so marked an extent that the illustration would pass muster anywhere as having been drawn from a full-blood buffalo. The head, neck, and hump, and the long woolly hair that covers them, proclaim the buffalo in every line. Excepting that the hair on the shoulders (below the hump) is of the same length as that on the body and hind quarters, there is, so far as one can judge from an excellent photograph, no difference whatever observable between this lusty young half-breed and a full blood buffalo calf of the same age and sex. Mr. Jones describes the color of this animal as ""iron-gray,"" and remarks: ""You will see how even the fur is, being as long on the hind parts as on the shoulders and neck, very much unlike the buffalo, which is so shaggy about the shoulders and so thin farther back."" Upon this point it is to be remarked that the hair on the body of a yearling or two year-old buffalo is always very much longer in proportion to the hair on the forward parts than it is later in life, and while the shoulder hair is always decidedly longer than that back of it, during the first two years the contrast is by no means so very great. A reference to the memoranda of hair measurements already given will afford precise data on this point. In regard to half-breed calves, Mr. Bedson states in a private letter that ""the hump does not appear until several months after birth."" Altogether, the male calf described above so strongly resembles a pure-blood buffalo as to be generally mistaken for one; the form of the adult half-blood cow promptly proclaims her origin. The accompanying plate, also from a photograph supplied by Mr. Jones, accurately represents a half-breed cow, six years old, weighing about 1,800 pounds. Her body is very noticeably larger in proportion than that of the cow buffalo, her pelvis much heavier, broader, and more cow-like, therein being a decided improvement upon the small and weak hind quarters of the wild species. The hump is quite noticeable, but is not nearly so high as in the pure buffalo cow. The hair on the fore quarters, neck, and head is decidedly shorter, especially on the head; the frontlet and chin beard being conspicuously lacking. The tufts of long, coarse, black hair which clothe the fore-arm of the buffalo cow are almost absent, but apparently the hair on the body and hind quarters has lost but little, if any, of its length, density, and fine, furry quality. The horns are decidedly cow-like in their size, length, and curvature. [Illustration: HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) CALF.--HERD OF C. J. JONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] Regarding the general character of the half-breed buffalo, and his herd in general, Mr. Bedson writes me as follows, in a letter dated September 12, 1888: ""The nucleus of my herd consisted of a young buffalo bull and four heifer calves, which I purchased in 1877, and the increase from these few has been most rapid, as will be shown by a tabular statement farther on. ""Success with the breeding of the pure buffalo was followed by experiments in crossing with the domestic animal. This crossing has generally been between a buffalo bull and an ordinary cow, and with the most encouraging results, since it had been contended by many that although the cow might breed a calf from the buffalo, yet it would be at the expense of her life, owing to the hump on a buffalo's shoulder; but this hump does not appear until several months after birth. This has been proved a fallacy respecting _this herd_ at least, for calving has been attended with no greater percentage of losses than would be experienced in ranching with the ordinary cattle. Buffalo cows and crosses have dropped calves at as low a temperature as 20Â° below zero, and the calves were sturdy and healthy. ""The half breed resulting from the cross as above mentioned has been again crossed with the thoroughbred buffalo bull, producing a three quarter breed animal closely resembling the buffalo, the head and robe being quite equal, if not superior. The half-breeds are very prolific. The cows drop a calf annually. They are also very hardy indeed, as they take the instinct of the buffalo during the blizzards and storms, and do not drift like native cattle. They remain upon the open prairie during our severest winters, while the thermometer ranges from 30 to 40 degrees below zero, with little or no food except what they rustled on the prairie, and no shelter at all. In nearly all the ranching parts of North America foddering and housing of cattle is imperative in a more or less degree,[50] creating an item of expense felt by all interested in cattle-raising; but the buffalo [half]breed retains all its native hardihood, needs no housing, forages in the deepest snows for its own food, yet becomes easily domesticated, and consequently needs but little herding. Therefore the progeny of the buffalo is easily reared, cheaply fed, and requires no housing in winter; three very essential points in stock-raising. [Note 50: On nearly all the great cattle ranches of the United States it is absolutely impossible, and is not even attempted.--W. T. H.] ""They are always in good order, and I consider the meat of the half-breed much preferable to domestic animals, while the robe is very fine indeed, the fur being evened up on the hind parts, the same as on the shoulders. During the history of the herd, accident and other causes have compelled the slaughtering of one or two, and in these instances the carcasses have sold for 18 cents per pound; the hides in their dressed state for $50 to $75 each. A half-breed buffalo ox (four years old, crossed with buffalo bull and Durham cow) was killed last winter, and weighed 1,280 pounds dressed beef. One pure buffalo bull now in my herd weighs fully 2,000 pounds, and a [half]breed bull 1,700 to 1,800 pounds. ""The three-quarter breed is an enormous animal in size, and has an extra good robe, which will readily bring $40 to $50 in any market where there is a demand for robes. They are also very prolific, and I consider them the coming cattle for our range cattle for the Northern climate, while the half and quarter breeds will be the animals for the more Southern district. The half and three-quarter breed cows, when really matured, will weigh from 1,400 to 1,800 pounds. ""I have never crossed them except with a common grade of cows, while I believe a cross with the Galloways would produce the handsomest robe ever handled, and make the best range cattle in the world. I have not had time to give my attention to my herd, more than to let them range on the prairies at will. By proper care great results can be accomplished."" Hon. C. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., whose years of experience with the buffalo, both as old-time hunter, catcher, and breeder, has earned for him the sobriquet of ""Buffalo Jones,"" five years ago became deeply interested in the question of improving range cattle by crossing with the buffalo. With characteristic Western energy he has pursued the subject from that time until the present, having made five trips to the range of the only buffaloes remaining from the great southern herd, and captured sixty-eight buffalo calves and eleven adult cows with which to start a herd. In a short article published in the Farmers' Review (Chicago, August 22, 1888), Mr. Jones gives his views on the value of the buffalo in cross-breeding as follows: ""In all my meanderings I have not found a place but I could count more carcasses [of cattle] than living animals. Who has not ridden over some of the Western railways and counted dead cattle by the thousands? The great question is, Where can we get a race of cattle that will stand blizzards, and endure the drifting snow, and will not be driven with the storms against the railroad fences and pasture fences, there to perish for the want of nerve to face the northern winds for a few miles, to where the winter grasses could be had in abundance? Realizing these facts, both from observation and pocket, we pulled on our 'thinking cap,' and these points came vividly to our mind: ""(1) We want an animal that is hardy. ""(2) We want an animal with nerve and endurance. ""(3) We want an animal that faces the blizzards and endures the storms. ""(4) We want an animal that will rustle the prairies, and not yield to discouragement. ""(5) We want an animal that will fill the above bill, and make good beef and plenty of it. [Illustration: HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) COW.--HERD OF C. J. JONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] ""All the points above could easily be found in the buffalo, excepting the fifth, and even that is more than filled as to the quality, but not in quantity. Where is the 'old timer' who has not had a cut from the hump or sirloin of a fat buffalo cow in the fall of the year, and where is the one who will not make affidavit that it was the best meat he ever ate? Yes, the fat was very rich, equal to the marrow from the bone of domestic cattle. * * * ""The great question remained unsolved as to the quantity of meat from the buffalo. I finally heard of a half-breed buffalo in Colorado, and immediately set out to find it. I traveled at least 1,000 miles to find it, and found a five-year-old half-breed cow that had been bred to domestic bulls and had brought forth two calves--a yearling and a sucking calf that gave promise of great results. ""The cow had never been fed, but depended altogether on the range, and when I saw her, in the fall of 1883. I estimated her weight at 1,800 pounds. She was a brindle, and had a handsome robe even in September; she had as good hind quarters as ordinary cattle; her foreparts were heavy and resembled the buffalo, yet not near so much of the hump. The offspring showed but very little of the buffalo, yet they possessed a woolly coat, which showed clearly that they were more than domestic cattle. * * * ""What we can rely on by having one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths breeds might be analyzed as follows: ""We can depend upon a race of cattle unequaled in the world for hardiness and durability; a good meat-bearing animal; the best and only fur-bearing animal of the bovine race; the animal always found in a storm where it is overtaken by it; a race of cattle so clannish as never to separate and go astray; the animal that can always have free range, as they exist where no other animal can live; the animal that can water every third day and keep fat, ranging from 20 to 30 miles from water; in fact, they are the perfect animal for the plains of North America. One-fourth breeds for Texas, one-half breeds for Colorado and Kansas, and three-fourths breeds for more northern country, is what will soon be sought after more than any living animal. Then we will never be confronted with dead carcarsses from starvation, exhaustion, and lack of nerve, as in years gone by."" _The bison as a beast of burden._--On account of the abundance of horses for all purposes throughout the entire country, oxen are so seldom used they almost constitute a curiosity. There never has existed a necessity to break buffaloes to the yoke and work them like domestic oxen, and so few experiments have been made in this direction that reliable data on this subject is almost wholly wanting. While at Miles City, Mont., I heard of a German ""granger"" who worked a small farm in the Tongue River Valley, and who once had a pair of cow buffaloes trained to the yoke. It was said that they were strong, rapid walkers, and capable of performing as much work as the best domestic oxen, but they were at times so uncontrollably headstrong and obstinate as to greatly detract from their usefulness. The particular event of their career on which their historian dwelt with special interest occurred when their owner was hauling a load of potatoes to town with them. In the course of the long drive the buffaloes grew very thirsty, and upon coming within sight of the water in the river they started for it in a straight course. The shouts and blows of the driver only served to hasten their speed, and presently, when they reached the edge of the high bank, they plunged down it without the slightest hesitation, wagon, potatoes, and all, to the loss of everything except themselves and the drink they went after! Mr. Robert Wickliffe states that trained buffaloes make satisfactory oxen. ""I have broken them to the yoke, and found them capable of making excellent oxen; and for drawing wagons, carts, or other heavily laden vehicles on long journeys they would, I think, be greatly preferable to the common ox."" It seems probable that, in the absence of horses, the buffalo would make a much more speedy and enduring draught animal than the domestic ox, although it is to be doubted whether he would be as strong. His weaker pelvis and hind quarters would surely count against him under certain circumstances, but for some purposes his superior speed and endurance would more than counterbalance that defect. BISON HERDS AND INDIVIDUALS IN CAPTIVITY AND DOMESTICATION, JANUARY 1, 1889. _Herd of Mr. S. L. Bedson, Stony Mountain, Manitoba._--In 1877 Mr. Bedson purchased 5 buffalo calves, 1 bull, and 4 heifers, for which he paid $1,000. In 1888 his herd consisted of 23 full-blood bulls, 35 cows, 3 half-breed cows, 5 half-breed bulls, and 17 calves, mixed and pure;[51] making a total of 83 head. These were all produced from the original 5, no purchases having been made, nor any additions made in any other way. Besides the 83 head constituting the herd when it was sold, 5 were killed and 9 given away, which would otherwise make a total of 97 head produced since 1877. In November, 1888, this entire herd was purchased, for $50,000, by Mr. C. J. Jones, and added to the already large herd owned by that gentleman in Kansas. [Note 51: In summing up the total number of buffaloes and mixed-breeds now alive in captivity, I have been obliged to strike an average on this lot of calves ""mixed and pure,"" and have counted twelve as being of pure breed and five mixed, which I have reason to believe is very near the truth.] [Illustration: YOUNG HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) BULL.--HERD OF C. J. JONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] _Herd of Mr. C. J. Jones, Garden City, Kans._--Mr. Jones's original herd of 57 buffaloes constitute a living testimonial to his individual enterprise, and to his courage, endurance, and skill in the chase. The majority of the individuals composing the herd he himself ran down, lassoed, and tied with his own hands. For the last five years Mr. Jones has made an annual trip, in June, to the uninhabited ""panhandle"" of Texas, to capture calves out of the small herd of from one hundred to two hundred head which represented the last remnant of the great southern herd. Each of these expeditious involved a very considerable outlay in money, an elaborate ""outfit"" of men, horses, vehicles, camp equipage, and lastly, but most important of all, a herd of a dozen fresh milch cows to nourish the captured calves and keep them from dying of starvation and thirst. The region visited was fearfully barren, almost without water, and to penetrate it was always attended by great hardship. The buffaloes were difficult to find, but the ground was good for running, being chiefly level plains, and the superior speed of the running horses always enabled the hunters to overtake a herd whenever one was sighted, and to ""cut out"" and lasso two, three, or four of its calves. The degree of skill and daring displayed in these several expeditions are worthy of the highest admiration, and completely surpass anything I have ever seen or read of being accomplished in connection with hunting, or the capture of live game. The latest feat of Mr. Jones and his party comes the nearest to being incredible. During the month of May, 1888, they not only captured seven calves, but also _eleven adult cows_, of which some were lassoed in full career on the prairie, thrown, tied, and hobbled! The majority, however, were actually ""rounded up,"" herded, and held in control until a bunch of tame buffaloes was driven down to meet them, so that it would thus be possible to drive all together to a ranch. This brilliant feat can only be appreciated as it deserves by those who have lately hunted buffalo, and learned by dear experience the extent of their wariness, and the difficulties, to say nothing of the dangers, inseparably connected with their pursuit. The result of each of Mr. Jones's five expeditions is as follows: In 1884 no calves found; 1885, 11 calves captured, 5 died, 6 survived; 1886, 14 calves captured, 7 died, 7 survived; 1887, 36 calves captured, 6 died, 30 survived; 1888, 7 calves captured, all survived; 1888, 11 old cows captured, all survived. Total, 79 captures, 18 losses, 57 survivors. The census of the herd is exactly as follows: Adult cows, 11; three-year olds, 7, of which 2 are males and 5 females; two-year olds, 4, of which all are males; yearling, 28, of which 15 are males and 13 females; calves, 7, of which 3 are males and 4 females. Total herd, 57; 24 males and 33 females. To this, Mr. Jones's original herd, must now be added the entire herd formerly owned by Mr. Bedson. Respecting his breeding operations Mr. Jones writes: ""My oldest [bull] buffaloes are now three years old, and I am breeding one hundred domestic cows to them this year. Am breeding the Galloway cows quite extensively; also some Shorthorns, Herefords, and Texas cows. I expect best results from the Galloways. If I can get the black luster of the latter and the fur of a buffalo, I will have a robe that will bring more money than we get for the average range steer."" In November, 1888, Mr. Jones purchased Mr. Bedson's entire herd, and in the following mouth proceeded to ship a portion of it to Kansas City. Thirty-three head were separated from the remainder of the herd on the prairie near Stony Mountain, 12 miles from Winnipeg, and driven to the railroad. Several old bulls broke away en route and ran back to the herd, and when the remainder were finally corraled in the pens at the stock-yards ""they began to fight among themselves, and some fierce encounters were waged between the old bulls. The younger cattle were raised on the horns of their seniors, thrown in the air, and otherwise gored."" While on the way to St. Paul three of the half-breed buffaloes were killed by their companions. On reaching Kansas City and unloading the two cars, 13 head broke away from the large force of men that attempted to manage them, stampeded through the city, and finally took refuge in the low-lands along the river. In due time, however, all were recaptured. Since the acquisition of this northern herd and the subsequent press comment that it has evoked, Mr. Jones has been almost overwhelmed with letters of inquiry in regard to the whole subject of buffalo breeding, and has found it necessary to print and distribute a circular giving answers to the many inquiries that have been made. _Herd of Mr. Charles Allard, Flathead Indian Reservation, Montana._--This herd was visited in the autumn of 1888 by Mr. G. O. Shields, of Chicago, who reports that it consists of thirty-five head of pure-blood buffaloes, of which seven are calves of 1888, six are yearlings, and six are two-year olds. Of the adult animals, four cows and two bulls are each fourteen years old, ""and the beards of the bulls almost sweep the ground as they walk."" _Herd of Hon. W. F. Cody (""Buffalo Bill"")._--The celebrated ""Wild West Show"" has, ever since its organization, numbered amongst its leading attractions a herd of live buffaloes of all ages. At present this herd contains eighteen head, of which fourteen were originally purchased of Mr. H. T. Groome, of Wichita, Kansas, and have made a journey to London and back. As a proof of the indomitable persistence of the bison in breeding under most unfavorable circumstances, the fact that four of the members of this herd are calves which were born in 1888 in London, at the American Exposition, is of considerable interest. This herd is now (December, 1888) being wintered on General Beale's farm, near the city of Washington. In 1886-'87, while the Wild West Show was at Madison Square Garden, New York City, its entire herd of twenty buffaloes was carried off by pleuro-pneumonia. It is to be greatly feared that sooner or later in the course of its travels the present herd will also disappear, either through disease or accident. _Herd of Mr. Charles Goodnight, Clarendon, Texas._--Mr. Goodnight writes that he has ""been breeding buffaloes in a small way for the past ten years,"" but without giving any particular attention to it. At present his herd consists of thirteen head, of which two are three-year old bulls and four are calves. There are seven cows of all ages, one of which is a half-breed. _Herd at the Zoological Society's Gardens, Philadelphia, Arthur E. Brown, superintendent._--This institution is the fortunate possessor of a small herd of ten buffaloes, of which four are males and six females. Two are calves of 1877. In 1886 the Gardens sold an adult bull and cow to Hon. W. F. Cody for $300. _Herd at Bismarck Grove, Kansas, owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad Company._--A small herd of buffaloes has for several years past been kept at Bismarck Grove as an attraction to visitors. At present it contains ten head, one of which is a very large bull, another in a four-year-old bull, six are cows of various ages, and two are two-year olds. In 1885 a large bull belonging to this herd grew so vicious and dangerous that it was necessary to kill him. The following interesting account of this herd was published in the Kansas City Times of December 8, 1888: ""Thirteen years ago Colonel Stanton purchased a buffalo bull calf for $8 and two heifers for $25. The descendants of these three buffaloes now found at Bismarck Grove, where all were born, number in all ten. There were seventeen, but the rest have died, with the exception of one, which was given away. They are kept in an inclosure containing about 30 acres immediately adjoining the park, and there may be seen at any time. The sight is one well worth a trip and the slight expense that may attach to it, especially to one who has never seen the American bison in his native state. ""The present herd includes two fine bull calves dropped last spring, two heifers, five cows, and a bull six years old and as handsome as a picture. The latter has been named Cleveland, after the colonel's favorite Presidential candidate. The entire herd is in as fine condition as any beef cattle, though they were never fed anything but hay and are never given any shelter. In fact they don't take kindly to shelter, and whether a blizzard is blowing, with the mercury 20 degrees below zero, or the sun pouring down his scorching rays, with the thermometer 110 degrees above, they set their heads resolutely toward storm or sun and take their medicine as if they liked it. Hon. W. F. Cody, ""Buffalo Bill,"" tried to buy the whole herd two years ago to take to Europe with his Wild West Show, but they were not for sale at his own figures, and, indeed, there is no anxiety to dispose of them at any figures. The railroad company has been glad to furnish them pasturage for the sake of adding to the attractions of the park, in which there are also forty-three head of deer, including two as fine bucks as ever trotted over the national deer trail toward the salt-licks in northern Utah. ""While the bison at Bismark Grove are splendid specimens of their class, ""Cleveland"" is decidedly the pride of the herd, and as grand a creature as ever trod the soil of Kansas on four legs. He is just six years old and is a perfect specimen of the kings of the plains. There is royal blood in his veins, and his coat is finer than the imperial purple. It is not possible to get at him to measure his stature and weight. He must weigh fully 3,000 pounds, and it is doubtful if there is to-day living on the face of the earth a handsomer buffalo bull than he. ""Cleveland's"" disposition is not so ugly as old Barney's was, but at certain seasons he is very wild, and there is no one venturesome enough to go into the inclosure. It is then not altogether safe to even look over the high and heavy board fence at him, for he is likely to make a run for the visitor, as the numerous holes in the fence where he has knocked off the boards will testify."" _Herd of Mr. Frederick Dupree, Cheyenne Indian Agency, near Fort Bennett, Dakota._--This herd contains at present nine pure-blood buffaloes, five of which are cows and seven mixed bloods. Of the former, there are two adult bulls and four adult cows. Of the mixed blood animals, six are half-breeds and one a quarter-breed buffalo. Mr. Dupree obtained the nucleus of his herd in 1882, at which time he captured five wild calves about 100 miles west of Fort Bennett. Of these, two died after two months of captivity and a third was killed by an Indian in 1885. Mr. D. F. Carlin, of the Indian service, at Fort Bennett, has kindly furnished me the following information respecting this herd, under date of November 1, 1888: ""The animals composing this herd are all in fine condition and are quite tame. They keep by themselves most of the time, except the oldest bull (six years old), who seems to appreciate the company of domestic cattle more than that of his own family. Mr. Dupree has kept one half-breed bull as an experiment; he thinks it will produce a hardy class of cattle. His half-breeds are all black, with one exception, and that is a roan; but they are all built like the buffalo, and when young they grunt more like a hog than like a calf, the same as a full-blood buffalo. ""Mr. Dupree has never lost a [domestic] cow in giving birth to a half-breed calf, as was supposed by many people would be the case. There have been no sales from this herd, although the owner has a standing offer of $650 for a cow and bull. The cows are not for sale at any price."" _Herd at Lincoln Park, Chicago, Mr. W. P. Walker, superintendent._--This very interesting and handsomely-kept herd is composed of seven individuals of the following character: One bull eight years old, one bull four years old, two cows eight years old, two cows two years old in the spring of 1888, and one female calf born in the spring of 1888. _Zoological Gardens, Cincinnati, Ohio._--This collection contains four bison, an adult bull and cow, and one immature specimen. _Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, Rapid City, Dakota_, has a herd of four pure buffaloes and one half-breed. Of the former, the two adults, a bull and cow seven years old, were caught by Sioux Indians near the Black Hills for the owner in the spring of 1882. The Indians drove two milch cows to the range to nourish the calves when caught. These have produced two calves, one of which, a bull, is now three years old, and the other is a yearling heifer. _Central Park Menagerie, New York, Dr. W. A. Conklin, director._--This much-visited collection contains four bison, an adult bull and cow, a two-year-old calf, and a yearling. _Mr. John H. Starin, Glen Inland, near New York City._--There are four buffaloes at this summer resort. _The U. S. National Museum, Washington, District of Columbia._--The collection of the department of living animals at this institution contains two fine young buffaloes; a bull four years old in July, 1888, and a cow three years old in May of the same year. These animals were captured in western Nebraska, when they were calves, by H. R. Jackett, of Ogalalla, and kept by him on his ranch until 1885. In April, 1888, Hon. Eugene G. Blackford, of New York, purchased them of Mr. Frederick D. Nowell, of North Platte, Nebraska, for $100 for the pair, and presented them to the National Museum, in the hope that they might form the nucleus of a herd to be owned and exhibited by the United States Government in or near the city of Washington. The two animals were received in Ogalalla by Mr. Joseph Palmer, of the National Museum, and by him they were brought on to Washington in May, in fine condition. Since their arrival they have been exhibited to the public in a temporary inclosure on the Smithsonian Grounds, and have attracted much attention. _Mr. B. C. Winston, of Hamline, Minnesota_, owns a pair of buffaloes, one of which, a young bull, was caught by him in western Dakota in the spring of 1886, soon after its birth. The cow was purchased at Rosseau, Dakota Territory, a year later, for $225. _Mr. I. P. Butler, of Colorado, Texas_, is the owner of a young bull buffalo and a half-breed calf. _Mr. Jesse Huston, of Miles City, Montana_, owns a fine five-year-old bull buffalo. _Mr. L. F. Gardner, of Bellwood, Oregon_, is the owner of a large adult bull. _The Riverside Ranch Company, south of Mandan, Dakota_, owns a pair of full-blood buffaloes. _In Dakota_, in the hands of parties unknown, there are four full-blood buffaloes. _Mr. James R. Hitch, of Optima, Indian Territory_, has a pair of young buffaloes, which he has offered for sale for $750. _Mr. Joseph A. Hudson, of Estell, Nebraska_, owns a three-year-old bull buffalo, which is for sale. In other countries there are live specimens of _Bison americanus_ reported as follows: two at Belleview Gardens, Manchester, England; one at the Zoological Gardens, London; one at Liverpool, England (purchased of Hon. W. F. Cody in 1888); two at the Zoological Gardens, Dresden; one at the Zoological Gardens, Calcutta. +--------------------------------------------------+ | _Statistics of full-blood buffaloes | | | in captivity January 1, 1889._ | | +---------------------------------------------+----+ |Number kept for breeding purposes | 216| |Number kept for exhibition | 40| | | ---| | Total pure-blood buffaloes in captivity | 256| |Wild buffaloes under Government | | |protection in the Yellowstone Park | 200| |Number of mixed-breed buffalo-domestics | 40| +--------------------------------------------------+ There are, without doubt, a few half-breeds in Manitoba of which I have no account.

PART II.--THE EXTERMINATION. I. CAUSES OF THE EXTERMINATION. The causes which led to the practical extinction (in a wild state, at least) of the most economically valuable wild animal that ever inhabited the American continent, are by no means obscure. It is well that we should know precisely what they were, and by the sad fate of the buffalo be warned in time against allowing similar causes to produce the same results with our elk, antelope, deer, moose, caribou, mountain sheep, mountain goat, walrus, and other animals. It will be doubly deplorable if the remorseless slaughter we have witnessed during the last twenty years carries with it no lessons for the future. A continuation of the record we have lately made as wholesale game butchers will justify posterity in dating us back with the mound-builders and cave-dwellers, when man's only known function was to slay and eat. The primary cause of the buffalo's extermination, and the one which embraced all others, was the descent of civilization, with all its elements of destructiveness, upon the whole of the country inhabited by that animal. From the Great Slave Lake to the Rio Grande the home of the buffalo was everywhere overrun by the man with a gun; and, as has ever been the case, the wild creatures were gradually swept away, the largest and most conspicuous forms being the first to go. The secondary causes of the extermination of the buffalo may be catalogued as follows: (1) Man's reckless greed, his wanton destructiveness, and improvidence in not husbanding such resources as come to him from the hand of nature ready made. (2) The total and utterly inexcusable absence of protective measures and agencies on the part of the National Government and of the West States and Territories. (3) The fatal preference on the part of hunters generally, both white and red, for the robe and flesh of the cow over that furnished by the bull. (4) The phenomenal stupidity of the animals themselves, and their indifference to man. (5) The perfection of modern breech-loading rifles and other sporting fire-arms in general. Each of these causes acted against the buffalo with its fall force, to offset which there was _not even one_ restraining or preserving influence, and it is not to be wondered at that the species went down before them. Had any one of these conditions been eliminated the result would have been reached far less quickly. Had the buffalo, for example, possessed one-half the fighting qualities of the grizzly bear he would have fared very differently, but his inoffensiveness and lack of courage almost leads one to doubt the wisdom of the economy of nature so far as it relates to him. II. METHODS OF SLAUGHTER. 1. _The still-hunt._--Of all the deadly methods of buffalo slaughter, the still-hunt was the deadliest. Of all the methods that were unsportsmanlike, unfair, ignoble, and utterly reprehensible, this was in every respect the lowest and the worst. Destitute of nearly every element of the buoyant excitement and spice of danger that accompanied genuine buffalo hunting on horseback, the still-hunt was mere butchery of the tamest and yet most cruel kind. About it there was none of the true excitement of the chase; but there was plenty of greedy eagerness to ""down"" as many ""head"" as possible every day, just as there is in every slaughter-house where the killers are paid so much per head. Judging from all accounts, it was about as exciting and dangerous work as it would be to go out now and shoot cattle on the Texas or Montana ranges. The probabilities are, however, that shooting Texas cattle would be the most dangerous; for, instead of running from a man on foot, as the buffalo used to do, range cattle usually charge down upon him, from motives of curiosity, perhaps, and not infrequently place his life in considerable jeopardy. The buffalo owes his extermination very largely to his own unparalleled stupidity; for nothing else could by any possibility have enabled the still-hunters to accomplish what they did in such an incredibly short time. So long as the chase on horseback was the order of the day, it ordinarily required the united efforts of from fifteen to twenty-five hunters to kill a thousand buffalo in a single season; but a single still-hunter, with a long-range breech-loader, who knew how to make a ""sneak"" and get ""a stand on a bunch,"" often succeeded in killing from one to three thousand in one season by his own unaided efforts. Capt. Jack Brydges, of Kansas, who was one of the first to begin the final slaughter of the southern herd, killed, by contract, one thousand one hundred and forty-two buffaloes in six weeks. So long as the buffalo remained in large herds their numbers gave each individual a feeling of dependence upon his fellows and of general security from harm, even in the presence of strange phenomena which he could not understand. When he heard a loud report and saw a little cloud of white smoke rising from a gully, a clump of sage-brash, or the top of a ridge, 200 yards away, he wondered what it meant, and held himself in readiness to follow his leader in case she should run away. But when the leader of the herd, usually the oldest cow, fell bleeding upon the ground, and no other buffalo promptly assumed the leadership of the herd, instead of acting independently and fleeing from the alarm, he merely did as he saw the others do, and waited his turn to be shot. Latterly, however, when the herds were totally broken up, when the few survivors were scattered in every direction, and it became a case of every buffalo for himself, they became wild and wary, ever ready to start off at the slightest alarm, and run indefinitely. Had they shown the same wariness seventeen years ago that the survivors have manifested during the last three or four years, there would now be a hundred thousand head alive instead of only about three hundred in a wild and unprotected state. Notwithstanding the merciless war that had been waged against the buffalo for over a century by both whites and Indians, and the steady decrease of its numbers, as well as its range, there were several million head on foot, not only up to the completion of the Union Pacific Railway, but as late as the year 1870. Up to that time the killing done by white men had been chiefly for the sake of meat, the demand for robes was moderate, and the Indians took annually less than one hundred thousand for trading. Although half a million buffaloes were killed by Indians, half-breeds, and whites, the natural increase was so very considerable as to make it seem that the evil day of extermination was yet far distant. But by a coincidence which was fatal to the buffalo, with the building of three lines of railway through the most populous buffalo country there came a demand for robes and hides, backed up by an unlimited supply of new and marvellously accurate breech-loading rifles and fixed ammunition. And then followed a wild rush of hunters to the buffalo country, eager to destroy as many head as possible in the shortest time. For those greedy ones the chase on horseback was ""too slow"" and too unfruitful. That was a retail method of killing, whereas they wanted to kill by wholesale. From their point of view, the still-hunt or ""sneak"" hunt was the method _par excellence_. If they could have obtained Gatling guns with which to mow down a whole herd at a time, beyond a doubt they would have gladly used them. The still-hunt was seen at its very worst in the years 1871, 1872, and 1873, on the southern buffalo range, and ten years later at its best in Montana, on the northern. Let us first consider it at its best, which in principle was bad enough. The great rise in the price of robes which followed the blotting out of the great southern herd at once put buffalo-hunting on a much more comfortable and respectable business basis in the North than it had ever occupied in the South, where prices had all along been phenomenally low. In Montana it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to invest from $1,000 to $2,000 in his ""outfit"" of horses, wagons, weapons, ammunition, provisions, and sundries. One of the men who accompanied the Smithsonian Expedition for Buffalo, Mr. James McNaney, of Miles City, Montana, was an ex-buffalo banter, who had spent three seasons on the northern range, killing buffalo for their robes, and his standing as a hunter was of the best. A brief description of his outfit and its work during its last season on the range (1882-'83) may fairly be taken as a typical illustration of the life and work of the still-hunter at its best. The only thing against it was the extermination of the buffalo. During the winters of 1880 and 1881 Mr. McNaney had served in Maxwell's outfit as a hunter, working by the month, but his success in killing was such that he decided to work the third year on his own account. Although at that time only seventeen years of age, he took an elder brother as a partner, and purchased an outfit in Miles City, of which the following were the principal items: Two wagons, 2 four-horse teams, 2 saddle-horses, 2 wall-tents, 1 cook-stove with pipe, 1 40-90 Sharp's rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-70 Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-120 Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 50 pounds gunpowder, 550 pounds lead, 4,500 primers, 600 brass shells, 4 sheets patch-paper, 60 Wilson skinning knives, 3 butcher's steels, 1 portable grindstone, flour, bacon, baking-powder, coffee, sugar, molasses, dried apples, canned vegetables, beans, etc., in quantity. The entire cost of the outfit was about $1,400. Two men were hired for the season at $50 per month, and the party started from Miles City on November 10, which was considered a very late start. The usual time of setting out for the range was about October 1. The outfit went by rail northeastward to Terry, and from thence across country south and east about 100 miles, around the head of O'Fallon Creek to the head of Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Little Missouri. A good range was selected, without encroachment upon the domains of the hunters already in the field, and the camp was made near the bank of the creek, close to a supply of wood and water, and screened from distant observation by a circle of hills and ridges. The two rectangular wall-tents were set up end to end, with the cook-stove in the middle, where the ends came together. In one tent the cooking and eating was done, and the other contained the beds. It was planned that the various members of the party should cook turn about, a week at a time, but one of them soon developed such a rare and conspicuous talent for bread-making and general cookery that he was elected by acclamation to cook during the entire season. To the other three members fell the hunting. Each man hunted separately from the others, and skinned all the animals that his rifle brought down. There were buffalo on the range when the hunters arrived, and the killing began at once. At daylight the still-hunter sallied forth on foot, carrying in his hand his huge Sharps rifle, weighing from 16 to 19 pounds, with from seventy-five to one hundred loaded cartridges in his two belts or his pockets. At his side, depending from his belt, hung his ""hunter's companion,"" a flat leather scabbard, containing a ripping knife, a skinning knife, and a butcher's steel upon which to sharpen them. The total weight carried was very considerable, seldom less than 36 pounds, and often more. Inasmuch as it was highly important to move camp as seldom as possible in the course of a season's work, the hunter exercised the greatest precaution in killing his game, and had ever before his mind the necessity of doing his killing without frightening away the survivors. With ten thousand buffaloes on their range, it was considered the height of good luck to find a ""bunch"" of fifty head in a secluded ""draw"" or hollow, where it was possible to ""make a kill"" without disturbing the big herd. The still-hunter usually went on foot, for when buffaloes became so scarce as to make it necessary for him to ride his occupation was practically gone. At the time I speak of, the hunter seldom had to walk more than 3 miles from camp to find buffalo, in case there were any at all on his range, and it was usually an advantage to be without a horse. From the top of a ridge or high butte the country was carefully scanned, and if several small herds were in sight the one easiest to approach was selected as the one to attack. It was far better to find a herd lying down or quietly grazing, or sheltering from a cold wind, than to find it traveling, for while a hard run of a mile or two often enabled the hunter to ""head off"" a moving herd and kill a certain number of animals out of it, the net results were never half so satisfactory as with herds absolutely at rest. Having decided upon an attack, the hunter gets to leeward of his game, and approaches it according to the nature of the ground. If it is in a hollow, he secures a position at the top of the nearest ridge, as close as he can get. If it is in a level ""flat,"" he looks for a gully up which he can skulk until within good rifle-shot. If there is no gully, he may be obliged to crawl half a mile on his hands and knees, often through snow or amongst beds of prickly pear, taking advantage of even such scanty cover as sage-brush affords. Some Montana still-hunters adopted the method of drawing a gunny-sack over the entire upper half of the body, with holes cut for the eyes and arms, which simple but unpicturesque arrangement often enabled the hunter to approach his game much more easily and more closely than would otherwise have been possible. [Illustration: STILL-HUNTING BUFFALOES ON THE NORTHERN RANGE. From a painting by J. H. Moser, in the National Museum.] Having secured a position within from 100 to 250 yards of his game (often the distance was much greater), the hunter secures a comfortable rest for his huge rifle, all the time keeping his own person thoroughly hidden from view, estimates the distance, carefully adjusts his sights, and begins business. If the herd is moving, the animal in the lead is the first one shot, close behind the fore leg and about a foot above the brisket, which sends the ball through the lungs. If the herd is at rest, the oldest cow is always supposed to be the leader, and she is the one to kill first. The noise startles the buffaloes, they stare at the little cloud of white smoke and feel inclined to run, but seeing their leader hesitate they wait for her. She, when struck, gives a violent start forward, but soon stops, and the blood begins to run from her nostrils in two bright crimson streams. In a couple of minutes her body sways unsteadily, she staggers, tries hard to keep her feet, but soon gives a lurch sidewise and falls. Some of the other members of the herd come around her and stare and sniff in wide-eyed wonder, and one of the more wary starts to lead the herd away. But before she takes half a dozen steps ""bang!"" goes the hidden rifle again, and her leadership is ended forever. Her fall only increases the bewilderment of the survivors over a proceeding which to them is strange and unaccountable, because the danger is not visible. They cluster around the fallen ones, sniff at the warm blood, bawl aloud in wonderment, and do everything but run away. The policy of the hunter is to not fire too rapidly, but to attend closely to business, and every time a buffalo attempts to make off, shoot it down. One shot per minute was a moderate rate of firing, but under pressure of circumstances two per minute could be discharged with deliberate precision. With the most accurate hunting rifle ever made, a ""dead rest,"" and a large mark practically motionless, it was no wonder that nearly every shot meant a dead buffalo. The vital spot on a buffalo which stands with its side to the hunter is about a foot in diameter, and on a full-grown bull is considerably more. Under such conditions as the above, which was called getting ""a stand,"" the hunter nurses his victims just as an angler plays a big fish with light tackle, and in the most methodical manner murders them one by one, either until the last one falls, his cartridges are all expended, or the stupid brutes come to their senses and run away. Occasionally the poor fellow was troubled by having his rifle get too hot to use, but if a snow-bank was at hand he would thrust the weapon into it without ceremony to cool it off. A success in getting a stand meant the slaughter of a good-sized herd. A hunter whom I met in Montana, Mr. Harry Andrews, told me that he once fired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot and killed sixty-three buffalo in less than an hour. The highest number Mr. McNaney ever knew of being killed in one stand was ninety-one head, but Colonel Dodge once counted one hundred and twelve carcasses of buffalo ""inside of a semicircle of 200 yards radius, all of which were killed by one man from the same spot, and in less than three-quarters of an hour."" The ""kill"" being completed, the hunter then addressed himself to the task of skinning his victims. The northern hunters were seldom guilty of the reckless carelessness and lack of enterprise in the treatment of robes which at one time was so prominent a feature of work on the southern range. By the time white men began to hunt for robes on the northern range, buffalo were becoming comparatively scarce, and robes were worth from $2 to $4 each. The fur-buyers had taught the hunters, with the potent argument of hard cash, that a robe carefully and neatly taken off, stretched, and kept reasonably free from blood and dirt, was worth more money in the market than one taken off in a slovenly manner, and contrary to the nicer demands of the trade. After 1880, buffalo on the northern range were skinned with considerable care, and amongst the robe-hunters not one was allowed to become a loss when it was possible to prevent it. Every full-sized cow robe was considered equal to $3.50 in hard cash, and treated accordingly. The hunter, or skinner, always stretched every robe out on the ground to its fullest extent while it was yet warm, and cut the initials of his employer in the thin subcutaneous muscle which always adhered to the inside of the skin. A warm skin is very elastic, and when stretched upon the ground the hair holds it in shape until it either dries or freezes, and so retains its full size. On the northern range skins were so valuable that many a dispute arose between rival outfits over the ownership of a dead buffalo, some of which produced serious results. 2. _The chase on horseback or ""running buffalo.""_--Next to the still-hunt the method called ""running buffalo"" was the most fatal to the race, and the one most universally practiced. To all hunters, save greedy white men, the chase on horseback yielded spoil sufficient for every need, and it also furnished sport of a superior kind--manly, exhilarating, and well spiced with danger. Even the horses shared the excitement and eagerness of their riders. So long as the weapons of the Indian consisted only of the bow and arrow and the spear, he was obliged to kill at close quarters or not at all. And even when fire-arms were first placed in his hands their caliber was so small, the charge so light, and the Indian himself so poor a marksman at long range, that his best course was still to gallop alongside the herd on his favorite ""buffalo horse"" and kill at the shortest possible range. From all accounts, the Red River half-breeds, who hunted almost exclusively with fire-arms, never dreamed of the deadly still hunt, but always killed their game by ""running"" it. In former times even the white men of the plains did the most of their buffalo hunting on horseback, using the largest-sized Colt's revolver, sometimes one in each hand, until the repeating-rifle made its appearance, which in a great measure displaced the revolver in running buffalo. But about that time began the mad warfare for ""robes"" and ""hides,"" and the only fair and sportsmanlike method of hunting was declared too slow for the greedy buffalo-skinners. Then came the cold-blooded butchery of the still-hunt. From that time on the buffalo as a game animal steadily lost caste. It soon came to be universally considered that there was no sport in hunting buffalo. True enough of still-hunting, where the hunter sneaks up and shoots them down one by one at such long range the report of his big rifle does not even frighten them away. So far as sportsmanlike fairness is concerned, that method was not one whit more elevated than killing game by poison. Bat the chase on horseback was a different thing. Its successful prosecution demanded a good horse, a bold rider, a firm seat, and perfect familiarity with weapons. The excitement of it was intense, the dangers not to be despised, and, above all, the buffalo had a fair show for his life, or partially so, at least. The mode of attack is easily described. Whenever the hunters discovered a herd of buffalo, they usually got to leeward of it and quietly rode forward in a body, or stretched out in a regular skirmish line, behind the shelter of a knoll, perhaps, until they had approached the herd as closely as could be done without alarming it. Usually the unsuspecting animals, with a confidence due more to their great numbers than anything else, would allow a party of horsemen to approach within from 200 to 400 yards of their flankers, and then they would start off on a slow trot. The hunters then put spurs to their horses and dashed forward to overtake the herd as quickly as possible. Once up with it, each hunter chooses the best animal within his reach, chases him until his flying steed carries him close alongside, and then the arrow or the bullet is sent into his vitals. The fatal spot is from 12 to 18 inches in circumference, and lies immediately back of the fore leg, with its lowest point on a line with the elbow. This, the true chase of the buffalo, was not only exciting, but dangerous. It often happened that the hunter found himself surrounded by the flying herd, and in a cloud of dust, so that neither man nor horse could see the ground before them. Under such circumstances fatal accidents to both men and horses were numerous. It was not an uncommon thing for half-breeds to shoot each other in the excitement of the chase; and, while now and then a wounded bull suddenly turned upon his pursuer and overthrew him, the greatest number of casualties were from falls. Of the dangers involved in running buffalo Colonel Dodge writes as follows:[52] [Note 52: Plains of the Great West, p. 127.] ""The danger is not so much from the buffalo, which rarely makes an effort to injure his pursuer, as from the fact that neither man nor horse can see the ground, which may be rough and broken, or perforated with prairie-dog or gopher holes. This danger is so imminent, that a man who runs into a herd of buffalo may be said to take his life in his hand. I have never known a man hurt by a buffalo in such a chase. I have known of at least six killed, and a very great many more or less injured, some very severely, by their horses falling with them."" On this point Catlin declares that to engage in running buffalo is ""at the hazard of every bone in one's body, to feel the fine and thrilling exhilaration of the chase for a moment, and then as often to upbraid and blame himself for his folly and imprudence."" Previous to my first experience in ""running buffalo"" I had entertained a mortal dread of ever being called upon to ride a chase across a prairie-dog town. The mouth of a prairie-dog's burrow is amply large to receive the hoof of a horse, and the angle at which the hole descends into the earth makes it just right for the leg of a running horse to plunge into up to the knee and bring down both horse and rider instantly; the former with a broken leg, to say the least of it. If the rider sits loosely, and promptly resigns his seat, he will go flying forward, as if thrown from a catapult, for 20 feet or so, perhaps to escape with a few broken bones, and perhaps to have his neck broken, or his skull fractured on the hard earth. If he sticks tightly to his saddle, his horse is almost certain to fall upon him, and perhaps kill him. Judge, then, my feelings when the first bunch of buffalo we started headed straight across the largest prairie-dog town I had ever seen up to that time. And not only was the ground honey-combed with gaping round holes, but it was also crossed here and there by treacherous ditch-like gullies, cut straight down into the earth to an uncertain depth, and so narrow as to be invisible until it was almost time to leap across them. But at such a time, with the game thundering along a few rods in advance, the hunter thinks of little else except getting up to it. He looks as far ahead as possible, and helps his horse to avoid dangers, but to a great extent the horse must guide himself. The rider plies his spurs and looks eagerly forward, almost feverish with excitement and eagerness, but at the same time if he is wise he _expects_ a fall, and holds himself in readiness to take the ground with as little damage as he can. Mr. Catlin gives a most graphic description of a hunting accident, which may fairly be quoted in full as a type of many such. I must say that I fully sympathize with M. Chardon in his estimate of the hardness of the ground he fell upon, for I have a painful recollection of a fall I had from which I arose with the settled conviction that the ground in Montana is the hardest in the world! It seemed more like falling upon cast-iron than prairie turf. ""I dashed along through the thundering mass as they swept away over the plain, scarcely able to tell whether I was on a buffalo's back or my horse, hit and hooked and jostled about, till at length I found myself alongside my game, when I gave him a shot as I passed him. [Illustration: THE CHASE ON HORSEBACK. From a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.] I saw guns flash about me in several directions, but I heard them not. Amidst the trampling throng Mons. Chardon had wounded a stately bull, and at this moment was passing him with his piece leveled for another shot. They were both at full speed and I also, within the reach of the muzzle of my gun, when the bull instantly turned, receiving the horse upon his horns, and the ground received poor Chardon, who made a frog's leap of some 20 feet or more over the bull's back and almost under my horse's heels. I wheeled my horse as soon as possible and rode back where lay poor Chardon, gasping to start his breath again, and within a few paces of him his huge victim, with his heels high in the air, and the horse lying across him. I dismounted instantly, but Chardon was raising himself on his hands, with his eyes and mouth full of dirt, and feeling for his gun, which lay about 30 feet in advance of him. 'Heaven spare you! are you hurt, Chardon?' 'Hi-hic--hic--hic--hic--no;--hic--no--no, I believe not. Oh, this is not much, Mons. Cataline--this is nothing new--but this is a d--d hard piece of ground here--hic--oh! hic!' At this the poor fellow fainted, but in a few moments arose, picked up his gun, took his horse by the bit, which then opened _its_ eyes, and with a _hic_ and a ugh--_ughk!_--sprang upon its feet, shook off the dirt, and here we were, all upon our legs again, save the bull, whose fate had been more sad than that of either.""[53] [Note 53: North American Indians, I, pp. 25-26.] The following passage from Mr. Alexander Ross's graphic description of a great hunt,[54] in which about four hundred hunters made an onslaught upon a herd, affords a good illustration of the dangers in running buffalo: [Note 54: Red River Settlement, p. 256.] ""On this occasion the surface was rocky and full of badger-holes. Twenty-three horses and riders were at one moment all sprawling on the ground; one horse, gored by a bull, was killed on the spot; two more were disabled by the fall; one rider broke his shoulder-blade; another burst his gun and lost three of his fingers by the accident; and a third was struck on the knee by an exhausted ball. These accidents will not be thought overnumerous, considering the result, for in the evening no less than thirteen hundred and seventy-five tongues were brought into camp."" It really seems as if the horses of the plains entered willfully and knowingly into the war on the doomed herds. But for the willingness and even genuine eagerness with which the ""buffalo horses"" of both white men and Indians entered into the chase, hunting on horseback would have been attended with almost insurmountable difficulties, and the results would have been much less fatal to the species. According to all accounts the horses of the Indians and half-breeds were far better trained than those of their white rivals, no doubt owing to the fact that the use of the bow, which required the free use of both hands, was only possible when the horse took the right coarse of his own free will or else could be guided by the pressure of the knees. If we may believe the historians of that period, and there is not the slightest reason to doubt them, the ""buffalo horses"" of the Indians displayed almost as much intelligence and eagerness in the chase as did their human riders. Indeed, in ""running buffalo"" with only the bow and arrow, nothing but the willing co-operation of the horse could have possibly made this mode of hunting either satisfactory or successful. In Lewis and Clarke's Travels, volume II, page 387, appears the following record: ""He [Sergeant Pryor] had found it almost impossible with two men to drive on the remaining horses, for as soon as they discovered a herd of buffaloes the loose horses immediately set off in pursuit of them, and surrounded the buffalo herd with almost as much skill as their riders could have done. At last he was obliged to send one horseman forward and drive all the buffaloes from the route."" The Hon. H. H. Sibley, who once accompanied the Red River half-breeds on their annual hunt, relates the following[55]: ""One of the hunters fell from his saddle, and was unable to overtake his horse, which continued the chase as if he of himself could accomplish great things, so much do these animals become imbued with a passion for this sport! On another occasion a half-breed left his favorite steed at the camp, to enable him to recruit his strength, enjoining upon his wife the necessity of properly securing the animal, which was not done. Not relishing the idea of being left behind, he started after us and soon was alongside, and thus he continued to keep pace with the hunters in their pursuit of the buffalo, seeming to await with impatience the fall of some of them to the earth. The chase ended, he came neighing to his master, whom he soon singled out, although the men were dispersed here and there for a distance of miles."" [Note 55: Schoolcraft's ""North American Indians,"" 108.] Col. R. I. Dodge, in his Plains of the Great West, page 129, describes a meeting with two Mexican buffalo-hunters whose horses were so fleet and so well trained that whenever a herd of buffalo came in sight, instead of shooting their game wherever they came up with it, the one having the best horse would dash into the herd, cut out a fat two-year old, and, with the help of his partner, then actually drive it to their camp before shooting it down. ""They had a fine lot of meat and a goodly pile of skins, and they said that every buffalo had been driven into camp and killed as the one I saw. 'It saves a heap of trouble packing the meat to camp,' said one of them, naively."" Probably never before in the history of the world, until civilized man came in contact with the buffalo, did whole armies of men march out in true military style, with officers, flags, chaplains, and rules of war, and make war on wild animals. No wonder the buffalo has been exterminated. So long as they existed north of the Missouri in any considerable number, the half-breeds and Indians of the Manitoba Red River settlement used to gather each year in a great army, and go with carts to the buffalo range. On these great hunts, which took place every year from about the 15th of June to the 1st of September, vast numbers of buffalo were killed, and the supply was finally exhausted. As if Heaven had decreed the extirpation of the species, the half-breed hunters, like their white robe-hunting rivals farther south, always killed _cows_ in preference to bulls so long as a choice was possible, the very course best calculated to exterminate any species in the shortest possible time. The army of half-breeds and Indians which annually went forth from the Red River settlement to make war on the buffalo was often far larger than the army with which Cortez subdued a great empire. As early as 1846 it had become so great, that it was necessary to divide it into two divisions, one of which, the White Horse Plain division, was accustomed to go west by the Assinniboine River to the ""rapids crossing-place,"" and from there in a southwesterly direction. The Red River division went south to Pembina, and did the most of their hunting in Dakota. The two divisions sometimes met (says Professor Hind), but not intentionally. In 1849 a Mr. Flett took a census of the White Horse Plain division, in Dakota Territory, and found that it contained 603 carts, 700 half-breeds, 200 Indians, 600 horses, 200 oxen, 400 dogs, and 1 cat. In his ""Red River Settlement"" Mr. Alexander Ross gives the following census of the number of carts assembled in camp for the buffalo hunt at five different-periods: +--------------------------+ |_Number of carts assembled| | for the first trip._ | +--------------------------+ |In 1820 | 540| |In 1825 | 680| |In 1830 | 820| |In 1835 | 970| |In 1840 | 1,210| +--------------------------+ The expedition which was accompanied by Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Catholic priest, whose account is set forth in the Hon. Mr. Sibley's paper on the buffalo,[56] was a comparatively small one, which started from Pembina, and very generously took pains not to spoil the prospects of the great Red River division, which was expected to take the field at the same time. This, therefore, was a small party, like others which had already reached the range; but it contained 213 carts, 55 hunters and their families, making 60 lodges in all. This party killed 1,776 cows (bulls not counted, many of which were killed, though ""not even a tongue was taken""), which yielded 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of dried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, and 556 bladders full of marrow. But this was very moderate slaughter, being about 33 buffalo to each family. Even as late as 1872, when buffalo were getting scarce, Mr. Grant[57] met a half-breed family on the Qu'Appelle, consisting of man, wife, and seven children, whose six carts were laden with the meat and robes yielded by _sixty_ buffaloes; that number representing this one hunter's share of the spoils of the hunt. [Note 56: Schoolcraft, pp. 101-110.] [Note 57: Ocean to Ocean, p. 116.] To afford an idea of the truly military character of those Red River expeditions, I have only to quote a page from Prof. Henry Youle Hind:[58] [Note 58: Assinniboine and Saskatch. Exp. Exped., II, p. 111.] ""After the start from the settlement has been well made, and all stragglers or tardy hunters have arrived, a great council is held and a president elected. A number of captains are nominated by the president and people jointly. The captains then proceed to appoint their own policemen, the number assigned to each not exceeding ten. Their duties are to see that the laws of the hunt are strictly carried out. In 1840, if a man ran a buffalo without permission before the general hunt began, his saddle and bridle were cut to pieces for the first offense; for the second offense his clothes were cut off his back. At the present day these punishments are changed to a fine of 20 shillings for the first offense. No gun is permitted to be fired when in the buffalo country before the 'race' begins. A priest sometimes goes with the hunt, and mass is then celebrated in the open prairies. ""At night the carts are placed in the form of a circle, with the horses and cattle inside the ring, and it is the duty of the captains and their policemen to see that this is rightly done. All laws are proclaimed in camp, and relate to the hunt alone. All camping orders are given by signal, a flag being carried by the guides, who are appointed by election. Each guide has his tarn of one day, and no man can pass a guide on duty without subjecting himself to a fine of 5 shillings. No hunter can leave the camp to return home without permission, and no one is permitted to stir until any animal or property of value supposed to be lost is recovered. The policemen, at the order of their captains, can seize any cart at night-fall and place it where they choose for the public safety, but on the following morning they are compelled to bring it back to the spot from which they moved it the previous evening. This power is very necessary, in order that the horses may not be stampeded by night attacks of the Sioux or other Indian tribes at war with the half-breeds. A heavy fine is imposed in case of neglect in extinguishing fires when the camp is broken up in the morning. ""In sight of buffalo all the hunters are drawn up in line, the president, captains, and police being a few yards in advance, restraining the impatient hunters. 'Not yet! Not yet!' is the subdued whisper of the president. The approach to the herd is cautiously made. 'Now!' the president exclaims; and as the word leaves his lips the charge is made, and in a few minutes the excited half-breeds are amongst the bewildered buffalo."" ""After witnessing one buffalo hunt,"" says Prof. John Macoun, ""I can not blame the half-breed and the Indian for leaving the farm and wildly making for the plains when it is reported that buffalo have crossed the border."" The ""great fall hunt"" was a regular event with about all the Indian tribes living within striking distance of the buffalo, in the course of which great numbers of buffalo were killed, great quantities of meat dried and made into pemmican, and all the skins taken were tanned in various ways to suit the many purposes they were called upon to serve. Mr. Francis La Flesche informs me that during the presence of the buffalo in western Nebraska and until they were driven south by the Sioux, the fall hunt of the Omahas was sometimes participated in by three hundred lodges, or about 3,000 people all told, six hundred of whom were warriors, and each of whom generally killed about ten buffaloes. The laws of the hunt were very strict and inexorable. In order that all participants should have an equal chance, it was decreed that any hunter caught ""still-hunting"" should be soundly flogged. On one occasion an Indian was discovered in the act, but not caught. During the chase which was made to capture him many arrows were fired at him by the police, but being better mounted than his pursuers he escaped, and kept clear of the camp during the remainder of the hunt. On another occasion an Omaha, guilty of the same offense, was chased, and in his effort to escape his horse fell with him in a coulÃ©e and broke one of his legs. In spite of the sad plight of the Omaha, his pursuers came up and flogged him, just as if nothing had happened. After the invention of the Colt's revolver, and breech-loading rifles generally, the chase on horseback speedily became more fatal to the bison than it ever had been before. With such weapons, it was possible to gallop into the midst of a flying herd and, during the course of a run of 2 or 3 miles, discharge from twelve to forty shots at a range of only a few yards, or even a few feet. In this kind of hunting the heavy Navy revolver was the favorite weapon, because it could be held in one hand and fired with far greater precision than could a rifle held in both hands. Except in the hands of an expert, the use of the rifle was limited, and often attended with risk to the hunter; but the revolver was good for all directions; it could very often be used with deadly effect where a rifle could not have been used at all, and, moreover, it left the bridle-hand free. Many cavalrymen and hunters were able to use a revolver with either hand, or one in each hand. Gen. Lew. Wallace preferred the Smith and Wesson in 1867, which he declared to be ""the best of revolvers"" then. It was his marvelous skill in shooting buffaloes with a rifle, from the back of a galloping horse, that earned for the Hon. W. F. Cody the sobriquet by which he is now familiarly known to the world--""Buffalo Bill."" To the average hunter on horseback the galloping of the horse makes it easy for him to aim at the heart of a buffalo and shoot clear over its back. No other shooting is so difficult, or requires such consummate dexterity as shooting with any kind of a gun, especially a rifle, from the back of a running horse. Let him who doubts this statement try it for himself and he will doubt no more. It was in the chase of the buffalo on horseback, armed with a rifle, that ""Buffalo Bill"" acquired the marvelous dexterity with the rifle which he has since exhibited in the presence of the people of two continents. I regret that circumstances have prevented my obtaining the exact figures of the great kill of buffaloes that Mr. Cody once made in a single run, in which he broke all previous records in that line, and fairly earned his title. In 1867 he entered into a contract with the Kansas Pacific Railway, then in course of construction through western Kansas, at a monthly salary of $500, to deliver all the buffalo meat that would be required by the army of laborers engaged in building the road. In eighteen mouths he killed 4,280 buffaloes. 3. _Impounding or Killing in Pens._--At first thought it seems hard to believe that it was ever possible for Indians to build pens and drive wild buffaloes into them, as cowboys now corral their cattle, yet such wholesale catches were of common occurrence among the Plains Crees of the south Saskatchewan country, and the same general plan was pursued, with slight modifications, by the Indians of the Assinniboine, Blackfeet, and Gros Ventres, and other tribes of the Northwest. Like the keddah elephant-catching operations in India, this plan was feasible only in a partially wooded country, and where buffalo were so numerous that their presence could be counted upon to a certainty. The ""pound"" was simply a circular pen, having a single entrance; but being unable to construct a gate of heavy timbers, such as is made to drop and close the entrance to an elephant pen, the Indians very shrewdly got over the difficulty by making the opening at the edge of a perpendicular bank 10 or 12 feet high, easy enough for a buffalo to jump down, but impossible for him to scale afterward. It is hardly probable that Indians who were expert enough to attack and kill buffalo on foot would have been tempted to undertake the labor that building a pound always involved, had it not been for the wild excitement attending captures made in this way, and which were shared to the fullest possible extent by warriors, women, and children alike. The best description of this method which has come under our notice is that of Professor Hind, who witnessed its practice by the Plains Crees, on the headwaters of the Qu'Appelle River, in 1858. He describes the pound he saw as a fence, constructed of the trunks of trees laced together with green withes, and braced on the outside by props, inclosing a circular space about 120 feet in diameter. It was placed in a pretty dell between sand-hills, and leading from it in two diverging rows (like the guiding wings of an elephant pen) were the two rows of bushes which the Indians designate ""dead men,"" which serve to guide the buffalo into the pound. The ""dead men"" extended a distance of 4 miles into the prairie. They were placed about 50 feet apart, and the two rows gradually diverged until at their extremities they were from 11/2 to 2 miles apart. [Illustration: CREE INDIANS IMPOUNDING BUFFALOES. Reproduced from Prof. H. Y. Hind's--""Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition.""] ""When the skilled hunters are about to bring in a herd of buffalo from the prairie,"" says Professor Hind, ""they direct the course of the gallop of the alarmed animals by confederates stationed in hollows or small depressions, who, when the buffalo appear inclined to take a direction leading from the space marked out by the 'dead men,' show themselves for a moment and wave their robes, immediately hiding again. This serves to turn the buffalo slightly in another direction, and when the animals, having arrived between the rows of 'dead men,' endeavor to pass through them, Indians stationed here and there behind a 'dead man' go through the same operation, and thus keep the animals within the narrowing limits of the converging lines. At the entrance to the pound there is a strong trunk of a tree placed about a foot from the ground, and on the inner side an excavation is made sufficiently deep to prevent the buffalo from leaping back when once in the pound. As soon as the animals have taken the fatal spring, they begin to gallop round and round the ring fence, looking for a chance to escape, but with the utmost silence women and children on the outside hold their robes before every orifice until the whole herd is brought in; then they climb to the top of the fence, and, with the hunters who have followed closely in the rear of the buffalo, spear or shoot with bows and arrows or fire-arms at the bewildered animals, rapidly becoming frantic with rage and terror, within the narrow limits of the pound. ""A dreadful scene of confusion and slaughter then begins; the oldest and strongest animals crush and toss the weaker; the shouts and screams of the excited Indians rise above the roaring of the bulls, the bellowing of the cows, and the piteous moaning of the calves. The dying struggles of so many huge and powerful animals crowded together create a revolting and terrible scene, dreadful from the excess of its cruelty and waste of life, but with occasional displays of wonderful brute strength and rage; while man in his savage, untutored, and heathen state shows both in deed and expression how little he is superior to the noble beasts he so wantonly and cruelly destroys.""[59] [Note 59: Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, p. 358.] The last scene of the bloody tragedy is thus set forth a week later: ""Within the circular fence ... lay, tossed in every conceivable position, over two hundred dead buffalo. [The exact number was 240.] From old bulls to calves of three months' old, animals of every age were huddled together in all the forced attitudes of violent death. Some lay on their backs, with eyes starting from their heads and tongue thrust out through clotted gore. Others were impaled on the horns of the old and strong bulls. Others again, which had been tossed, were lying with broken backs, two and three deep. One little calf hung suspended on the horns of a bull which had impaled it in the wild race round and round the pound. The Indians looked upon the dreadful and sickening sight with evident delight, and told how such and such a bull or cow had exhibited feats of wonderful strength in the death-struggle. The flesh of many of the cows had been taken from them, and was drying in the sun on stages near the tents. It is needless to say that the odor was overpowering, and millions of large blue flesh-flies, humming and buzzing over the putrefying bodies, was not the least disgusting part of the spectacle."" It is some satisfaction to know that when the first ""run"" was made, ten days previous, the herd of two hundred buffaloes was no sooner driven into the pound than a wary old bull espied a weak spot in the fence, charged it at full speed, and burst through to freedom and the prairie, followed by the entire herd. Strange as it may seem to-day, this wholesale method of destroying buffalo was once practiced in Montana. In his memoir on ""The American Bison,"" Mr. J. A. Allen states that as late as 1873, while journeying through that Territory in charge of the Yellowstone Expedition, he ""several times met with the remains of these pounds and their converging fences in the region above the mouth of the Big Horn River."" Mr. Thomas Simpson states that in 1840 there were three camps of Assinniboine Indians in the vicinity of Carlton House, each of which had its buffalo pound into which they drove forty or fifty animals daily. 4. _The ""Surround.""_--During the last forty years the final extermination of the buffalo has been confidently predicted by not only the observing white man of the West, but also nearly all the Indians and half-breeds who formerly depended upon this animal for the most of the necessities, as well as luxuries, of life. They have seen the great herds driven westward farther and farther, until the plains were left tenantless, and hunger took the place of feasting on the choice tid-bits of the chase. And is it not singular that during this period the Indian tribes were not moved by a common impulse to kill sparingly, and by the exercise of a reasonable economy in the chase to make the buffalo last as long as possible. But apparently no such thoughts ever entered their minds, so far as _they themselves_ were concerned. They looked with jealous eyes upon the white hunter, and considered him as much of a robber as if they had a brand on every buffalo. It has been claimed by some authors that the Indians killed with more judgment and more care for the future than did the white man, but I fail to find any evidence that such was ever the fact. They all killed wastefully, wantonly, and always about five times as many head as were really necessary for food. It was always the same old story, whenever a gang of Indians needed meat a whole herd was slaughtered, the choicest portions of the finest animals were taken, and about 75 per cent of the whole left to putrefy and fatten the wolves. And now, as we read of the appalling slaughter, one can scarcely repress the feeling of grim satisfaction that arises when we also read that many of the ex-slaughterers are almost starving for the millions of pounds of fat and juicy buffalo meat they wasted a few years ago. Verily, the buffalo is in a great measure avenged already. The following extract from Mr. Catlin's ""North American Indians,""[60] I, page 199-200, serves well to illustrate not only a very common and very deadly Indian method of wholesale slaughter--the ""surround""--but also to show the senseless destructiveness of Indians even when in a state of semi-starvation, which was brought upon them by similar acts of improvidence and wastefulness. [Note 60: H. Mis. 600, pt. 2-31] ""The Minatarees, as well as the Mandans, had suffered for some months past for want of meat, and had indulged in the most alarming fears that the herds of buffalo were emigrating so far off from them that there was great danger of their actual starvation, when it was suddenly announced through the village one morning at an early hour that a herd of buffaloes was in sight. A hundred or more young men mounted their horses, with weapons in hand, and steered their course to the prairies. * * * ""The plan of attack, which in this country is familiarly called a surround, was explicitly agreed upon, and the hunters, who were all mounted on their 'buffalo horses' and armed with bows and arrows or long lances, divided into two columns, taking opposite directions, and drew themselves gradually around the herd at a mile or more distance from them, thus forming a circle of horsemen at equal distances apart, who gradually closed in upon them with a moderate pace at a signal given. The unsuspecting herd at length 'got the wind' of the approaching enemy and fled in a mass in the greatest confusion. To the point where they were aiming to cross the line the horsemen were seen, at full speed, gathering and forming in a column, brandishing their weapons, and yelling in the most frightful manner, by which they turned the black and rushing mass, which moved off in an opposite direction, where they were again met and foiled in a similar manner, and wheeled back in utter confusion; by which time the horsemen had closed in from all directions, forming a continuous line around them, whilst the poor affrighted animals were eddying about in a crowded and confused mass, hooking and climbing upon each other, when the work of death commenced. I had rode up in the rear and occupied an elevated position at a few rods' distance, from which I could (like the general of a battlefield) survey from my horse's back the nature and the progress of the grand _mÃªlÃ©e_, but (unlike him) without the power of issuing a command or in any way directing its issue. ""In this grand turmoil [see illustration] a cloud of dust was soon raised, which in parts obscured the throng where the hunters were galloping their horses around and driving the whizzing arrows or their long lances to the hearts of these noble animals; which in many instances, becoming infuriated with deadly wounds in their sides, erected their shaggy manes over their bloodshot eyes and furiously plunged forward at the sides of their assailants' horses, sometimes goring them to death at a lunge and putting their dismounted riders to flight for their lives. Sometimes their dense crowd was opened, and the blinded horsemen, too intent on their prey amidst the cloud of dust, were hemmed and wedged in amidst the crowding beasts, over whose backs they were obliged to leap for security, leaving their horses to the fate that might await them in the results of this wild and desperate war. Many were the bulls that turned upon their assailants and met them with desperate resistance, and many were the warriors who were dismounted and saved themselves by the superior muscles of their legs; some who were closely pursued by the bulls wheeled suddenly around, and snatching the part of a buffalo robe from around their waists, threw it over the horns and eyes of the infuriated beast, and darting by its side drove the arrow or the lance to its heart; others suddenly dashed off upon the prairie by the side of the affrighted animals which had escaped from the throng, and closely escorting them for a few rods, brought down their heart's blood in streams and their huge carcasses upon the green and enameled turf. ""In this way this grand hunt soon resolved itself into a desperate battle, _and in the space of fifteen minutes resulted in the total destruction of the whole herd_, which in all their strength and fury were doomed, like every beast and living thing else, to fall before the destroying hands of mighty man. ""I had sat in trembling silence upon my horse and witnessed this extraordinary scene, which allowed not one of these animals to escape out of my sight. Many plunged off upon the prairie for a distance, but were overtaken and killed, and although I could not distinctly estimate the number that were slain, yet I am sure that some hundreds of these noble animals fell in this grand _mÃªlÃ©e_. * * * Amongst the poor affrighted creatures that had occasionally dashed through the ranks of their enemy and sought safety in flight upon the prairie (and in some instances had undoubtedly gained it), I saw them stand awhile, looking back, when they turned, and, as if bent on their own destruction, retraced their steps, and mingled themselves and their deaths with those of the dying throng. Others had fled to a distance on the prairies, and for want of company, of friends or of foes, had stood and gazed on till the battle-scene was over, seemingly taking pains to stay and hold their lives in readiness for their destroyers until the general destruction was over, when they fell easy victims to their weapons, making the slaughter complete."" It is to be noticed that _every animal_ of this entire herd of several hundred was slain on the spot, and there is no room to doubt that at least half (possibly much more) of the meat thus taken was allowed to become a loss. People who are so utterly senseless as to wantonly destroy their own source of food, as the Indians have done, certainly deserve to starve. This ""surround"" method of wholesale slaughter was also practiced by the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Sioux, Pawnees, Ornabas, and probably many other tribes. [Illustration: THE SURROUND. From a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.] 5. _Decoying and Driving._--Another method of slaughtering by wholesale is thus described by Lewis and Clarke, I, 235. The locality indicated was the Missouri River, in Montana, just above the mouth of Judith River: ""On the north we passed a precipice about 120 feet high, under which lay scattered the fragments of at least one hundred carcasses of buffaloes, although the water which had washed away the lower part of the hill, must have carried off many of the dead. These buffaloes had been chased down a precipice in a way very common on the Missouri, and by which vast herds are destroyed in a moment. The mode of hunting is to select one of the most active and fleet young men, who is disguised by a buffalo skin round his body; the skin of the head with the ears and horns fastened on his own head in such a way as to deceive the buffaloes. Thus dressed, he fixes himself at a convenient distance between a herd of buffaloes and any of the river precipices, which sometimes extend for some miles. ""His companions in the mean time get in the rear and side of the herd, and at a given signal show themselves, and advance towards the buffaloes. They instantly take alarm, and, finding the hunters beside them, they run toward the disguised Indian or decoy, who leads them on at full speed toward the river, when, suddenly securing himself in some crevice of the cliff which he had previously fixed on, the herd is left on the brink of the precipice; it is then in vain for the foremost to retreat or even to stop; they are pressed on by the hindmost rank, who, seeing no danger but from the hunters, goad on those before them till the whole are precipitated and the shore is strewed with their dead bodies. Sometimes in this perilous seduction the Indian is himself either trodden under foot by the rapid movements of the buffaloes, or, missing his footing in the cliff, is urged down the precipice by the falling herd. The Indians then select as much meat as they wish, and the rest is abandoned to the wolves, and creates a most dreadful stench."" Harper's Magazine, volume 38, page 147, contains the following from the pen of Theo. E. Davis, in an article entitled ""The Buffalo Range:"" ""As I have previously stated, the best hunting on the range is to be found between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers. Here I have seen the Indians have recourse to another method of slaughtering buffalo in a very easy, but to me a cruel way, for where one buffalo is killed several are sure to be painfully injured; but these, too, are soon killed by the Indians, who make haste to lance or shoot the cripples. ""The mode of hunting is somewhat as follows: A herd is discovered grazing on the table-lands. Being thoroughly acquainted with the country, the Indians are aware of the location of the nearest point where the table land is broken abruptly by a precipice which descends a hundred or more feet. Toward this 'devil-jump' the Indians head the herd, which is at once driven pell mell to and over the precipice. Meanwhile a number of Indians have taken their way by means of routes known to them, and succeed in reaching the caÃ±on through which the crippled buffalo are running in all directions. These are quickly killed, so that out of a very considerable band of buffalo but few escape, many having been killed by the fall and others dispatched while limping off. This mode of hunting is sometimes indulged in by harum-scarum white men, but it is done more for deviltry than anything else. I have never known of its practice by army officers or persons who professed to hunt buffalo as a sport."" 6. _Hunting on Snow-shoes._--""In the dead of the winters,"" says Mr. Catlin,[61] ""which are very long and severely cold in this country, where horses can not be brought into the chase with any avail, the Indian runs upon the surface of the snow by aid of his snow-shoes, which buoy him up, while the great weight of the buffaloes sinks them down to the middle of their sides, and, completely stopping their progress, insures them certain and easy victims to the bow or lance of their pursuers. The snow in these regions often lies during the winter to the depth of 3 and 4 feet, being blown away from the tops and sides of the hills in many places, which are left bare for the buffaloes to graze upon, whilst it is drifted in the hollows and ravines to a very great depth, and rendered almost entirely impassable to these huge animals, which, when closely pursued by their enemies, endeavor to plunge through it, but are soon wedged in and almost unable to move, where they fall an easy prey to the Indian, who runs up lightly upon his snow-shoes and drives his lance to their hearts. The skins are then stripped off, to be sold to the fur traders, and the carcasses left to be devoured by the wolves. [Owing to the fact that the winter's supply of meat was procured and dried in the summer and fall months, the flesh of all buffalo killed in winter was allowed to become a total loss.] This is the season in which the greatest number of these animals are destroyed for their robes; they are most easily killed at this time, and their hair or fur, being longer and more abundant, gives greater value to the robe."" [Note 61: North American Indians, I, 253.] * * * * * III. PROGRESS OF THE EXTERMINATION. A. THE PERIOD OF DESULTORY DESTRUCTION, FROM 1730 TO 1830. [Illustration: INDIANS ON SNOW-SHOES HUNTING BUFFALOES. From a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.] The disappearance of the buffalo from all the country east of the Mississippi was one of the inevitable results of the advance of civilization. To the early pioneers who went forth into the wilderness to wrestle with nature for the necessities of life, this valuable animal might well have seemed a gift direct from the hand of Providence. During the first few years of the early settler's life in a new country, the few domestic animals he had brought with him were far too valuable to be killed for food, and for a long period he looked to the wild animals of the forest and the prairie for his daily supply of meat. The time was when no one stopped to think of the important part our game animals played in the settlement of this country, and even now no one has attempted to calculate the lessened degree of rapidity with which the star of empire would have taken its westward way without the bison, deer, elk, and antelope. The Western States and Territories pay little heed to the wanton slaughter of deer and elk now going on in their forests, but the time will soon come when the ""grangers"" will enter those regions and find the absence of game a very serious matter. Although the bison was the first wild species to disappear before the advance of civilization, he served a good purpose at a highly critical period. His huge bulk of toothsome flesh fed many a hungry family, and his ample robe did good service in the settler's cabin and sleigh in winter weather. By the time game animals had become scarce, domestic herds and flocks had taken their place, and hunting became a pastime instead of a necessity. As might be expected, from the time the bison was first seen by white men he has always been a conspicuous prize, and being the largest of the land quadrupeds, was naturally the first to disappear. Every man's hand has been against him. While his disappearance from the eastern United States was, in the main, due to the settler who killed game as a means of subsistence, there were a few who made the killing of those animals a regular business. This occurred almost exclusively in the immediate vicinity of salt springs, around which the bison congregated in great numbers, and made their wholesale slaughter of easy accomplishment. Mr. Thomas Ashe[62] has recorded some very interesting facts and observations on this point. In speaking of an old man who in the latter part of the last century built a log house for himself ""on the immediate borders of a salt spring,"" in western Pennsylvania, for the purpose of killing buffaloes out of the immense droves which frequented that spot, Mr. Ashe says: [Note 62: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.] ""In the first and second years this old man, with some companions, killed from six to seven hundred of these noble creatures merely for the sake of their skins, which to them were worth only 2 shillings each; and after this 'work of death' they were obliged to leave the place till the following season, or till the wolves, bears, panthers, eagles, rooks, ravens, etc., had devoured the carcasses and abandoned the place for other prey. In the two following years the same persons killed great numbers out of the first droves that arrived, skinned them, and left their bodies exposed to the sun and air; but they soon had reason to repent of this, for the remaining droves, as they came up in succession, stopped, gazed on the mangled and putrid bodies, sorrowfully moaned or furiously lowed aloud, and returned instantly to the wilderness in an unusual run, without tasting their favorite spring or licking the impregnated earth, which was also once their most agreeable occupation; nor did they nor any of their race ever revisit the neighborhood. ""The simple history of this spring is that of every other in the settled parts of this Western World; the carnage of beasts was everywhere the same. I met with a man who had killed two thousand buffaloes with his own hand, and others no doubt have done the same thing. In consequence of such proceedings not one buffalo is at this time to be found east of the Mississippi, except a few domesticated by the curious, or carried through the country on a public show."" But, fortunately, there is no evidence that such slaughter as that described by Mr. Ashe was at all common, and there is reason for the belief that until within the last forty years the buffalo was sacrificed in ways conducive to the greatest good of the greatest number. From Coronado to General FrÃ©mont there has hardly been an explorer of United States territory who has not had occasion to bless the bison, and its great value to mankind can hardly be overestimated, although by many it can readily be forgotten. The disappearance of the bison from the eastern United States was due to its consumption as food. It was very gradual, like the march of civilization, and, under the circumstances, absolutely inevitable. In a country so thickly peopled as this region speedily became, the mastodon could have survived extinction about as easily as the bison. Except when the latter became the victim of wholesale slaughter, there was little reason to bemoan his fate, save upon grounds that may be regarded purely sentimental. He served a most excellent purpose in the development of the country. Even as late as 1875 the farmers of eastern Kansas were in the habit of making trips every fall into the western part of that State for wagon loads of buffalo meat as a supply for the succeeding winter. The farmers of Texas, Nebraska, Dakota, and Minnesota also drew largely upon the buffalo as long as the supply lasted. The extirpation of the bison west of the Rocky Mountains was due to legitimate hunting for food and clothing rather than for marketable peltries. In no part of that whole region was the species ever numerous, although in the mountains themselves, notably in Colorado, within easy reach of the great prairies on the east, vast numbers were seen by the early explorers and pioneers. But to the westward, away from the mountains, they were very rarely met with, and their total destruction in that region was a matter of easy accomplishment. According to Prof. J. A. Allen the complete disappearance of the bison west of the Rocky Mountains took place between 1838 and 1840. B. THE PERIOD OF SYSTEMATIC SLAUGHTER, FROM 1830 TO 1838. We come now to a history which I would gladly leave unwritten. Its record is a disgrace to the American people in general, and the Territorial, State, and General Government in particular. It will cause succeeding generations to regard us as being possessed of the leading characteristics of the savage and the beast of prey--cruelty and greed. We will be likened to the blood-thirsty tiger of the Indian jungle, who slaughters a dozen bullocks at once when he knows he can eat only one. In one respect, at least, the white men who engaged in the systematic slaughter of the bison were savages just as much as the Piegan Indians, who would drive a whole herd over a precipice to secure a week's rations of meat for a single village. The men who killed buffaloes for their tongues and those who shot them from the railway trains for sport were murderers. In no way does civilized man so quickly revert to his former state as when he is alone with the beasts of the field. Give him a gun and something which he may kill without getting himself in trouble, and, presto! he is instantly a savage again, finding exquisite delight in bloodshed, slaughter, and death, if not for gain, then solely for the joy and happiness of it. There is no kind of warfare against game animals too unfair, too disreputable, or too mean for white men to engage in if they can only do so with safety to their own precious carcasses. They will shoot buffalo and antelope from running railway trains, drive deer into water with hounds and cut their throats in cold blood, kill does with fawns a week old, kill fawns by the score for their spotted skins, slaughter deer, moose, and caribou in the snow at a pitiful disadvantage, just as the wolves do; exterminate the wild ducks on the whole Atlantic seaboard with punt guns for the metropolitan markets; kill off the Rocky Mountain goats for hides worth only 50 cents apiece, destroy wagon loads of trout with dynamite, and so on to the end of the chapter. Perhaps the most gigantic task ever undertaken on this continent in the line of game-slaughter was the extermination of the bison in the great pasture region by the hide-hunters. Probably the brilliant rapidity and success with which that lofty undertaking was accomplished was a matter of surprise even to those who participated in it. The story of the slaughter is by no means a long one. The period of systematic slaughter of the bison naturally begins with the first organized efforts in that direction, in a business-like, wholesale way. Although the species had been steadily driven westward for a hundred years by the advancing settlements, and had during all that time been hunted for the meat and robes it yielded, its extermination did not begin in earnest until 1820, or thereabouts. As before stated, various persons had previous to that time made buffalo killing a business in order to sell their skins, but such instances were very exceptional. By that time the bison was totally extinct in all the region lying east of the Mississippi River except a portion of Wisconsin, where it survived until about 1830. In 1820 the first organized buffalo hunting expedition on a grand scale was made from the Red River settlement, Manitoba, in which five hundred and forty carts proceeded to the range. Previous to that time the buffaloes were found near enough to the settlements around Fort Garry that every settler could hunt independently; but as the herds were driven farther and farther away, it required an organized effort and a long journey to reach them. The American Fur Company established trading posts along the Missouri River, one at the mouth of the TetÃ³n River and another at the mouth of the Yellowstone. In 1826 a post was established at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, at the head of the Arkansas River, and in 1832 another was located in a corresponding situation at the head of the South Fork of the Platte, close to where Denver now stands. Both the latter were on what was then the western border of the buffalo range. Elsewhere throughout the buffalo country there were numerous other posts, always situated as near as possible to the best hunting ground, and at the same time where they would be most accessible to the hunters, both white and red. As might be supposed, the Indians were encouraged to kill buffaloes for their robes, and this is what Mr. George Catlin wrote at the mouth of the TetÃ³n River (Pyatt County, Dakota) in 1832 concerning this trade:[63] ""It seems hard and cruel (does it not?) that we civilized people, with all the luxuries and comforts of the world about us, should be drawing from the backs of these useful animals the skins for our luxury, leaving their carcasses to be devoured by the wolves; that we should draw from that country some one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand of their robes annually, the greater part of which are taken from animals that are killed expressly for the robe, at a season when the meat is not cured and preserved, and for each of which skins the Indian has received but a pint of whisky! Such is the fact, and that number, or near it, are annually destroyed, in addition to the number that is necessarily killed for the subsistence of three hundred thousand Indians, who live chiefly upon them."" The author further declared that the fur trade in those ""great western realms"" was then limited chiefly to the purchase of buffalo robes. 1. _The Red River half-breeds._--In June, 1840, when the Red River half-breeds assembled at Pembina for their annual expedition against the buffalo, they mustered as follows: +-------------------------------------+ |Carts |1,210| +-------------------------+-----+-----+ |Hunters | 620| | +-------------------------+-----+ | |Women | 650|1,630| +-------------------------+-----+ | |Boys and girls | 360| | +-------------------------+-----+-----+ |Horses (buffalo runners) | 403| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Dogs | 542| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Cart horses | 655| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Draught oxen | 586| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Skinning knives |1,240| +-------------------------------------+ The total value of the property employed in this expedition and the working time occupied by it (two months) amounted to the enormous sum of Â£24,000. [Note 63: North American Indians, I, p. 263.] Although the bison formerly ranged to Fort Garry (near Winnipeg), they had been steadily killed off and driven back, and in 1840 none were found by the expedition until it was 250 miles from Pembina, which is situated on the Red River, at the international boundary. At that time the extinction of the species from the Red River to the Cheyenne was practically complete. The Red River settlers, aided, of course, by the Indians of that region, are responsible for the extermination of the bison throughout northeastern Dakota as far as the Cheyenne River, northern Minnesota, and the whole of what is now the province of Manitoba. More than that; as the game grew scarce and retired farther and farther, the half-breeds, who despised agriculture as long as there was a buffalo to kill, extended their hunting operations westward along the Qu'Appelle until they encroached upon the hunting-grounds of the Plain Crees, who lived in the Saskatchewan country. Thus was an immense inroad made in the northern half of the herd which had previously covered the entire pasture region from the Great Slave Lake to central Texas. This was the first visible impression of the systematic killing which began in 1820. Up to 1840 it is reasonably certain, as will be seen by figures given elsewhere, that by this business-like method of the half-breeds, at least 652,000 buffaloes were destroyed by them alone. Even as early as 1840 the Red River hunt was prosecuted through Dakota southwestwardly to the Missouri River and a short distance beyond it. Here it touched the wide strip of territory, bordering that stream, which was even then being regularly drained of its animal resources by the Indian hunters, who made the river their base of operations, and whose robes were shipped on its steam-boats. It is certain that these annual Red River expeditions into Dakota were kept up as late as 1847, and as long thereafter as buffaloes were to be found in any number between the Cheyenne and the Missouri. At the same time, the White Horse Plains division, which hunted westward from Fort Garry, did its work of destruction quite as rapidly and as thoroughly as the rival expedition to the United States. In 1857 the Plains Crees, inhabiting the country around the headwaters of the Qu'Appelle River (250 miles due west from Winnipeg), assembled in council, and ""determined that in consequence of promises often made and broken by the white men and half-breeds, and the rapid destruction by them of the buffalo they fed on, they would not permit either white men or half-breeds to hunt in their country, or travel through it, except for the purpose of trading for their dried meat, pemmican, skins and robes."" In 1858 the Crees reported that between the two branches of the Saskatchewan buffalo were ""very scarce."" Professor Hind's expedition saw only one buffalo in the whole course of their journey from Winnipeg until they reached Sand Hill Lake, at the head of the Qu'Appelle, near the south branch of the Saskatchewan, where the first herd was encountered. Although the species was not totally extinct on the Qu'Appelle at that time, it was practically so. 2. _The country of the Sioux._--The next territory completely depopulated of buffaloes by systematic hunting was very nearly the entire southern half of Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, and northern Nebraska as far as the North Platte. This vast region, once the favorite range for hundreds of thousands of buffaloes, had for many years been the favorite hunting ground of the Sioux Indians of the Missouri, the Pawnees, Omahas, and all other tribes of that region. The settlement of Iowa and Minnesota presently forced into this region the entire body of Mississippi Sioux from the country west of Prairie du Chien and around Fort Snelling, and materially hastened the extermination of all the game animals which were once so abundant there. It is absolutely certain that if the Indians had been uninfluenced by the white traders, or, in other words, had not been induced to take and prepare a large number of robes every year for the market, the species would have survived very much longer than it did. But the demand quickly proved to be far greater than the supply. The Indians, of course, found it necessary to slaughter annually a great number of buffaloes for their own wants--for meat, robes, leather, teepees, etc. When it came to supplementing this necessary slaughter by an additional fifty thousand or more every year for marketable robes, it is no wonder that the improvident savages soon found, when too late, that the supply of buffaloes was not inexhaustible. Naturally enough, they attributed their disappearance to the white man, who was therefore a robber, and a proper subject for the scalping-knife. Apparently it never occurred to the minds of the Sioux that they themselves were equally to blame; it was always _the paleface_ who killed the buffaloes; and it was always _Sioux_ buffaloes that they killed. The Sioux seemed to feel that they held a chattel mortgage on all the buffaloes north of the Platte, and it required more than one pitched battle to convince them otherwise. Up to the time when the great Sioux Reservation was established in Dakota (1875-'77), when 33,739 square miles of country, or nearly the whole southwest quarter of the Territory, was set aside for the exclusive occupancy of the Sioux, buffaloes were very numerous throughout that entire region. East of the Missouri River, which is the eastern boundary of the Sioux Reservation, from Bismarck all the way down, the species was practically extinct as early as 1870. But at the time when it became unlawful for white hunters to enter the territory of the Sioux nation there were tens of thousands of buffaloes upon it, and their subsequent slaughter is chargeable to the Indians alone, save as to those which migrated into the hunting grounds of the whites. 3. _Western railways, and their part in the extermination of the buffalo._--The building of a railroad means the speedy extermination of all the big game along its line. In its eagerness to attract the public and build up ""a big business,"" every new line which traverses a country containing game does its utmost, by means of advertisements and posters, to attract the man with a gun. Its game resorts are all laid bare, and the market hunters and sportsmen swarm in immediately, slaying and to slay. Within the last year the last real retreat for our finest game, the only remaining stronghold for the mountain sheep, goat, caribou, elk, and deer--northwestern Montana, northern Idaho, and thence westward--has been laid open to the very heart by the building of the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway, which runs up the valley of the Milk River to Fort Assinniboine, and crosses the Rocky Mountains through Two Medicine Pass. Heretofore that region has been so difficult to reach that the game it contains has been measurably secure from general slaughter; but now it also must ""go."" The marking out of the great overland trail by the Argonauts of '49 in their rush for the gold fields of California was the foreshadowing of the great east-and-west breach in the universal herd, which was made twenty years later by the first transcontinental railway. The pioneers who ""crossed the plains"" in those days killed buffaloes for food whenever they could, and the constant harrying of those animals experienced along the line of travel, soon led them to retire from the proximity of such continual danger. It was undoubtedly due to this cause that the number seen by parties who crossed the plains in 1849 and subsequently, was surprisingly small. But, fortunately for the buffaloes, the pioneers who would gladly have halted and turned aside now and then for the excitement of the chase, were compelled to hurry on, and accomplish the long journey while good weather lasted. It was owing to this fact, and the scarcity of good horses, that the buffaloes found it necessary to retire only a few miles from the wagon route to get beyond the reach of those who would have gladly hunted them. Mr. Allen Varner, of Indianola, Illinois, has kindly furnished me with the following facts in regard to the presence of the buffalo, as observed by him during his journey westward, over what was then known as the Oregon Trail. ""The old Oregon trail ran from Independence, Missouri, to old Fort Laramie, through the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, and thence up to Salt Lake City. We left Independence on May C, 1849, and struck the Platte River at Grand Island. The trail had been traveled but very little previous to that year. We saw no buffaloes whatever until we reached the forks of the Platte, on May 20, or thereabouts. There we saw seventeen head. From that time on we saw small bunches now and then; never more than forty or fifty together. We saw no great herds anywhere, and I should say we did not see over five hundred head all told. The most western point at which we saw buffaloes was about due north of Laramie Peak, and it must have been about the 20th of June. We killed several head for meat during our trip, and found them all rather thin in flesh. Plainsmen who claimed to know, said that all the buffaloes we saw had wintered in that locality, and had not had time to get fat. The annual migration from the south had not yet begun, or rather had not yet brought any of the southern buffaloes that far north."" In a few years the tide of overland travel became so great, that the buffaloes learned to keep away from the dangers of the trail, and many a pioneer has crossed the plains without ever seeing a live buffalo. 4. _The division of the universal herd._--Until the building of the first transcontinental railway made it possible to market the ""buffalo product,"" buffalo hunting as a business was almost wholly in the hands of the Indians. Even then, the slaughter so far exceeded the natural increase that the narrowing limits of the buffalo range was watched with anxiety, and the ultimate extinction of the species confidently predicted. Even without railroads the extermination of the race would have taken place eventually, but it would have been delayed perhaps twenty years. With a recklessness of the future that was not to be expected of savages, though perhaps perfectly natural to civilized white men, who place the possession of a dollar above everything else, the Indians with one accord singled out the _cows_ for slaughter, because their robes and their flesh better suited the fastidious taste of the noble redskin. The building of the Union Pacific Railway began at Omaha in 1865, and during that year 40 miles were constructed. The year following saw the completion of 265 miles more, and in 1867 245 miles were added, which brought it to Cheyenne. In 1868, 350 miles were built, and in 1869 the entire line was open to traffic. In 1867, when Maj. J. W. Powell and Prof. A. H. Thompson crossed the plains by means of the Union Pacific Railway as far as it was constructed and thence onward by wagon, they saw during the entire trip only one live buffalo, a solitary old bull, wandering aimlessly along the south bank of the Platte River. The completion of the Union Pacific Railway divided forever the buffaloes of the United States into two great herds, which thereafter became known respectively as the northern and southern herds. Both retired rapidly and permanently from the railway, and left a strip of country over 50 miles wide almost uninhabited by them. Although many thousand buffaloes were killed by hunters who made the Union Pacific Railway their base of operations, the two great bodies retired north and south so far that the greater number were beyond striking distance from that line. 5. _The destruction of the southern herd._--The geographical center of the great southern herd during the few years of its separate existence previous to its destruction was very near the present site of Garden City, Kansas. On the east, even as late as 1872, thousands of buffaloes ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, which was then the headquarters of a great number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their occupation vigorously during the winter. On the north the herd ranged within 25 miles of the Union Pacific, until the swarm of hunters coming down from the north drove them farther and farther south. On the west, a few small bands ranged as far as Pike's Peak and the South Park, but the main body ranged east of the town of Pueblo, Colorado. In the southwest, buffaloes were abundant as far as the Pecos and the Staked Plains, while the southern limit of the herd was about on a line with the southern boundary of New Mexico. Regarding this herd, Colonel Dodge writes as follows: ""Their most prized feeding ground was the section of country between the South Platte and Arkansas rivers, watered by the Republican, Smoky, Walnut, Pawnee, and other parallel or tributary streams, and generally known as the Republican country. Hundreds of thousands went south from here each winter, but hundreds of thousands remained. It was the chosen home of the buffalo."" Although the range of the northern herd covered about twice as much territory as did the southern, the latter contained probably twice as many buffaloes. The number of individuals in the southern herd in the year 1871 must have been at least three millions, and most estimates place the total much higher than that. During the years from 1866 to 1871, inclusive, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railway and what is now known as the Kansas Pacific, or Kansas division of the Union Pacific Railway, were constructed from the Missouri River westward across Kansas, and through the heart of the southern buffalo range. The southern herd was literally cut to pieces by railways, and every portion of its range rendered easily accessible. There had always been a market for buffalo robes at a fair price, and as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country the slaughter began. The rush to the range was only surpassed by the rush to the gold mines of California in earlier years. The railroad builders, teamsters, fortune-seekers, ""professional"" hunters, trappers, guides, and every one out of a job turned out to hunt buffalo for hides and meat. The merchants who had already settled in all the little towns along the three great railways saw an opportunity to make money out of the buffalo product, and forthwith began to organize and supply hunting parties with arms, ammunition, and provisions, and send them to the range. An immense business of this kind was done by the merchants of Dodge City (Fort Dodge), Wichita, and Leavenworth, and scores of smaller towns did a corresponding amount of business in the same line. During the years 1871 to 1874 but little else was done in that country except buffalo killing. Central depots were established in the best buffalo country, from whence hunting parties operated in all directions. Buildings were erected for the curing of meat, and corrals were built in which to heap up the immense piles of buffalo skins that accumulated. At Dodge City, as late as 1878, Professor Thompson saw a lot of baled buffalo skins in a corral, the solid cubical contents of which he calculated to equal 120 cords. At first the utmost wastefulness prevailed. Every one wanted to kill buffalo, and no one was willing to do the skinning and curing. Thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed for their tongues alone, and never skinned. Thousands more were wounded by unskillful marksmen and wandered off to die and become a total loss. But the climax of wastefulness and sloth was not reached until the enterprising buffalo-butcher began to skin his dead buffaloes by horse-power. The process is of interest, as showing the depth of degradation to which a man can fall and still call himself a hunter. The skin of the buffalo was ripped open along the belly and throat, the legs cut around at the knees, and ripped up the rest of the way. The skin of the neck was divided all the way around at the back of the head, and skinned back a few inches to afford a start. A stout iron bar, like a hitching post, was then driven through the skull and about 18 inches into the earth, after which a rope was tied very firmly to the thick skin of the neck, made ready for that purpose. The other end of this rope was then hitched to the whiffletree of a pair of horses, or to the rear axle of a wagon, the horses were whipped up, and the skin was forthwith either torn in two or torn off the buffalo with about 50 pounds of flesh adhering to it. It soon became apparent to even the most enterprising buffalo skinner that this method was not an unqualified success, and it was presently abandoned. The slaughter which began in 1871 was prosecuted with great vigor and enterprise in 1872, and reached its heighten 1873. By that time, the buffalo country fairly swarmed with hunters, each, party putting forth its utmost efforts to destroy more buffaloes than its rivals. By that time experience had taught the value of thorough organization, and the butchering was done in a more business-like way. By a coincidence that proved fatal to the bison, it was just at the beginning of the slaughter that breech-loading, long-range rifles attained what was practically perfection. The Sharps 40-90 or 45-120, and the Remington were the favorite weapons of the buffalo-hunter, the former being the one in most general use. Before the leaden hail of thousands of these deadly breech-loaders the buffaloes went down at the rate of several thousand daily during the hunting season. During the years 1871 and 1872 the most wanton wastefulness prevailed. Colonel Dodge declares that, though hundreds of thousands of skins were sent to market, they scarcely indicated the extent of the slaughter. Through want of skill in shooting and want of knowledge in preserving the hides of those slain by green hunters, _one hide sent to market represented three, four, or even five dead buffalo_. The skinners and curers knew so little of the proper mode of curing hides, that at least half of those actually taken were lost. In the summer and fall of 1872 one hide sent to market represented at least _three_ dead buffalo. This condition of affairs rapidly improved; but such was the furor for slaughter, and the ignorance of all concerned, that every hide sent to market in 1871 represented no less than _five_ dead buffalo. By 1873 the condition of affairs had somewhat improved, through better organization of the hunting parties and knowledge gained by experience in curing. For all that, however, buffaloes were still so exceedingly plentiful, and shooting was so much easier than skinning, the latter was looked upon as a necessary evil and still slighted to such an extent that every hide actually sold and delivered represented two dead buffaloes. In 1874 the slaughterers began to take alarm at the increasing scarcity of buffalo, and the skinners, having a much smaller number of dead animals to take care of than ever before, were able to devote more time to each subject and do their work properly. As a result, Colonel Dodge estimated that during 1874, and from that time on, one hundred skins delivered represented not more than one hundred and twenty-five dead buffaloes; but that ""no parties have ever got the proportion lower than this."" The great southern herd was slaughtered by still-hunting, a method which has already been fully described. A typical hunting party is thus described by Colonel Dodge:[64] ""The most approved party consisted of four men--one shooter, two skinners, and one man to cook, stretch hides, and take care of camp. Where buffalo were very plentiful the number of skinners was increased. A light wagon, drawn by two horses or mules, takes the outfit into the wilderness, and brings into camp the skins taken each day. The outfit is most meager: a sack of flour, a side of bacon, 5 pounds of coffee, tea, and sugar, a little salt, and possibly a few beans, is a month's supply. A common or ""A"" tent furnishes shelter; a couple of blankets for each man is a bed. One or more of Sharps or Remington's heaviest sporting rifles, and an unlimited supply of ammunition, is the armament; while a coffee-pot, Dutch-oven, frying-pan, four tin plates, and four tin cups constitute the kitchen and table furniture. ""The skinning knives do duty at the platter, and 'fingers were made before forks.' Nor must be forgotten one or more 10-gallon kegs for water, as the camp may of necessity be far away from a stream. The supplies are generally furnished by the merchant for whom the party is working, who, in addition, pays each of the party a specified percentage of the value of the skins delivered. The shooter is carefully selected for his skill and knowledge of the habits of the buffalo. He is captain and leader of the party. When all is ready, he plunges into the wilderness, going to the center of the best buffalo region known to him, not already occupied (for there are unwritten regulations recognized as laws, giving to each hunter certain rights of discovery and occupancy). Arrived at the position, he makes his camp in some hidden ravine or thicket, and makes all ready for work."" [Note 64: Plains of the Great West, p. 134.] Of course the slaughter was greatest along the lines of the three great railways--the Kansas Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ©, and the Union Pacific, about in the order named. It reached its height in the season of 1873. During that year the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad carried out of the buffalo country 251,443 robes, 1,017,600 pounds of meat, and 2,743,100 pounds of bones. The end of the southern herd was then near at hand. Could the southern buffalo range have been roofed over at that time it would have made one vast charnel-house. Putrifying carcasses, many of them with the hide still on, lay thickly scattered over thousands of square miles of the level prairie, poisoning the air and water and offending the sight. The remaining herds had become mere scattered bands, harried and driven hither and thither by the hunters, who now swarmed almost as thickly as the buffaloes. A cordon of camps was established along the Arkansas River, the South Platte, the Republican, and the few other streams that contained water, and when the thirsty animals came to drink they were attacked and driven away, and with the most fiendish persistency kept from slaking their thirst, so that they would again be compelled to seek the river and come within range of the deadly breech-loaders. Colonel Dodge declares that in places favorable to such warfare, as the south bank of the Platte, a herd of buffalo has, by shooting at it by day and by lighting fires and firing guns at night, been kept from water until it has been entirely destroyed. In the autumn of 1873, when Mr. William Blackmore traveled for some 30 or 40 miles along the north bank of the Arkansas River to the east of Port Dodge, ""there was a continuous line of putrescent carcasses, so that the air was rendered pestilential and offensive to the last degree. The hunters had formed a line of camps along the banks of the river, and had shot down the buffalo, night and morning, as they came to drink. In order to give an idea of the number of these carcasses, it is only necessary to mention that I counted sixty-seven on one spot not covering 4 acres."" White hunters were not allowed to hunt in the Indian Territory, but the southern boundary of the State of Kansas was picketed by them, and a herd no sooner crossed the line going north than it was destroyed. Every water-hole was guarded by a camp of hunters, and whenever a thirsty herd approached, it was promptly met by rifle-bullets. During this entire period the slaughter of buffaloes was universal. The man who desired buffalo meat for food almost invariably killed five times as many animals as he could utilize, and after cutting from each victim its very choicest parts--the _tongue alone_, possibly, or perhaps the hump and hind quarters, one or the other, or both--fully four-fifths of the really edible portion of the carcass would be left to the wolves. It was no uncommon thing for a man to bring in two barrels of salted buffalo tongues, without another pound of meat or a solitary robe. The tongues were purchased at 25 cents each and sold in the markets farther east at 50 cents. In those days of criminal wastefulness it was a very common thing for buffaloes to be slaughtered for their tongues alone. Mr. George Catlin[65] relates that a few days previous to his arrival at the mouth of the TetÃ³n River (Dakota), in 1832, ""an immense herd of buffaloes had showed themselves on the opposite side of the river,"" whereupon a party of five or six hundred Sioux Indians on horseback forded the river, attacked the herd, recrossed the river about sunset, and came into the fort with fourteen hundred fresh buffalo tongues, which were thrown down in a mass, and for which they required only a few gallons of whisky, which was soon consumed in ""a little harmless carouse."" Mr. Catlin states that from all that he could learn not a skin or a pound of meat, other than the tongues, was saved after this awful slaughter. [Note 65: North American Indians, I, 256.] Judging from all accounts, it is making a safe estimate to say that probably no fewer than fifty thousand buffaloes have been killed for their tongues alone, and the most of these are undoubtedly chargeable against white men, who ought to have known better. A great deal has been said about the slaughter of buffaloes by foreign sportsmen, particularly Englishmen; but I must say that, from all that can be ascertained on this point, this element of destruction has been greatly exaggerated and overestimated. It is true that every English sportsman who visited this country in the days of the buffalo always resolved to have, and did have, ""a buffalo hunt,"" and usually under the auspices of United States Army officers. Undoubtedly these parties did kill hundreds of buffaloes, but it is very doubtful whether the aggregate of the number slain by foreign sportsmen would run up higher than ten thousand. Indeed, for myself, I am well convinced that there are many old ex-still-hunters yet living, each of whom is accountable for a greater number of victims than all buffaloes killed by foreign sportsmen would make added together. The professional butchers were very much given to crying out against ""them English lords,"" and holding up their hands in holy horror at buffaloes killed by them for their heads, instead of for hides to sell at a dollar apiece; but it is due the American public to say that all this outcry was received at its true value and deceived very few. By those in possession of the facts it was recognized as ""a blind,"" to divert public opinion from the real culprits. Nevertheless it is very true that many men who were properly classed as sportsmen, in contradistinction from the pot-hunters, did engage in useless and inexcusable slaughter to an extent that was highly reprehensible, to say the least. A sportsman is not supposed to kill game wantonly, when it can be of no possible use to himself or any one else, but a great many do it for all that. Indeed, the sportsman who kills sparingly and conscientiously is rather the exception than the rule. Colonel Dodge thus refers to the work of some foreign sportsmen: ""In the fall of that year [1872] three English gentlemen went out with me for a short hunt, and in their excitement bagged more buffalo than would have supplied a brigade."" As a general thing, however, the professional sportsmen who went out to have a buffalo hunt for the excitement of the chase and the trophies it yielded, nearly always found the bison so easy a victim, and one whose capture brought so little glory to the hunter, that the chase was voted very disappointing, and soon abandoned in favor of nobler game. In those days there was no more to boast of in killing a buffalo than in the assassination of a Texas steer. It was, then, the hide-hunters, white and red, but especially white, who wiped out the great southern herd in four short years. The prices received for hides varied considerably, according to circumstances, but for the green or undressed article it usually ranged from 50 cents for the skins of calves to $1.25 for those of adult animals in good condition. Such prices seem ridiculously small, but when it is remembered that, when buffaloes were plentiful it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to kill from forty to sixty head in a day, it will readily be seen that the _chances_ of making very handsome profits were sufficient to tempt hunters to make extraordinary exertions. Moreover, even when the buffaloes were nearly gone, the country was overrun with men who had absolutely nothing else to look to as a means of livelihood, and so, no matter whether the profits were great or small, so long as enough buffaloes remained to make it possible to get a living by their pursuit, they were hunted down with the most determined persistency and pertinacity. 6. _Statistics of the slaughter._--The most careful and reliable estimate ever made of results of the slaughter of the southern buffalo herd is that of Col. Richard Irving Dodge, and it is the only one I know of which furnishes a good index of the former size of that herd. Inasmuch as this calculation was based on actual statistics, supplemented by personal observations and inquiries made in that region during the great slaughter, I can do no better than to quote Colonel Dodge almost in full.[66] [Note 66: Plains of the Great West, pp. 139-144.] The Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad furnished the following statistics of the buffalo product carried by it during the years 1872, 1873, and 1874: +----------------------------------------------------+ | _Buffalo product._ | +----------------------------------------------------+ | | No. of skins | | | |Year. | carried. | Meat carried. | Bone carried.| +----------------------------------------------------+ | | | Pounds. | Pounds. | |1872 | 165,721 | ... | 1,135,300 | |1873 | 251,443 | 1,617,600 | 2,743,100 | |1874 | 42,289 | 632,800 | 6,914,950 | +------|--------------|---------------|--------------+ |Total | 459,453 | 2,250,400 | 10,793,350 | +----------------------------------------------------+ The officials of the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific railroads either could not or would not furnish any statistics of the amount of the buffalo product carried by their lines during this period, and it became necessary to proceed without the actual figures in both cases. Inasmuch as the Kansas Pacific road cuts through a portion of the buffalo country which was in every respect as thickly inhabited by those animals as the region traversed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ©, it seemed absolutely certain that the former road hauled out fully as many hides as the latter, if not more, and its quota is so set down. The Union Pacific line handled a much smaller number of buffalo hides than either of its southern rivals, but Colonel Dodge believes that this, ""with the smaller roads which touch the buffalo region, taken together, carried about as much as either of the two principal buffalo roads."" Colonel Dodge considers it reasonably certain that the statistics furnished by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© road represent only one-third of the entire buffalo product, and there certainly appears to be good ground for this belief. It is therefore in order to base further calculations upon these figures. According to evidence gathered on the spot by Colonel Dodge during the period of the great slaughter, one hide sent to market in 1872 represented three dead buffaloes, in 1873 two, and in 1874 one hundred skins delivered represented one hundred and twenty-five dead animals. The total slaughter by white men was therefore about as below: +---------------------------------------------------------------+ |Year.|Hides |Hides |Total |Total |Total | | |shipped |shipped |number of |number |of buffaloes| | |by A., T.|by other |buffaloes |killed and|slaughtered | | |and S. F.|roads, |utilized. |wasted. |by whites. | | |railway. |same | | | | | | |period. | | | | | | |(estimated)| | | | +-----+---------+-----------+-----------+----------+------------+ |1872 | 165,721 | 331,442 | 497,163 | 994,326| 1,491,489 | |1873 | 251,443 | 502,886 | 754,329 | 754,329| 1,508,658 | |1874 | 42,289 | 84,578 | 126,867 | 31,716| 158,583 | |Total| 459,453 | 918,906 |1,378,359 | 1,780,481| 3,158,730 | +---------------------------------------------------------------+ During all this time the Indians of all tribes within striking distance of the herds killed an immense number of buffaloes every year. In the summer they killed for the hairless hides to use for lodges and for leather, and in the autumn they slaughtered for robes and meat, but particularly robes, which were all they could offer the white trader in exchange for his goods. They were too lazy and shiftless to cure much buffalo meat, and besides it was not necessary, for the Government fed them. In regard to the number of buffaloes of the southern herd killed by the Indians, Colonel Dodge arrives at an estimate, as follows: ""It is much more difficult to estimate the number of dead buffalo represented by the Indian-tanned skins or robes sent to market. This number varies with the different tribes, and their greater or less contact with the whites. Thus, the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowas of the southern plains, having less contact with whites, use skins for their lodges, clothing, bedding, par-flÃ©ches, saddles, lariats, for almost everything. The number of robes sent to market represent only what we may call the foreign exchange of these tribes, and is really not more than one-tenth of the skins taken. To be well within bounds I will assume that one robe sent to market by these Indians represents six dead buffaloes. ""Those bands of Sioux who live at the agencies, and whose peltries are taken to market by the Union Pacific Railroad, live in lodges of cotton cloth furnished by the Indian Bureau. They use much civilized clothing, bedding, boxes, ropes, etc. For these luxuries they must pay in robes, and as the buffalo range is far from wide, and their yearly 'crop' small, more than half of it goes to market."" Leaving out of the account at this point all consideration of the killing done north of the Union Pacific Railroad, Colonel Dodge's figures are as follows: _Southern buffaloes slaughtered by southern Indians._ +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | |Sent to |No. of dead | | Indians. |market. |buffaloes | | | |represented.| +-----------------------------------------+----------+------------+ | | | | |Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, | | | |and other Indians whose robes go over the| | | |Atchison, Topeka and Santa FÃ© Railroad | 19,000 | 114,000 | |Sioux at agencies, Union Pacific Railroad| 10,000 | 16,000 | | +----------+------------+ |Total slaughtered per annum | 29,000 | 130,000 | |Total for the three years 1872-1874 | ... | 390,000 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ Reference has already been made to the fact that during those years an immense number of buffaloes were killed by the farmers of eastern Kansas and Nebraska for their meat. Mr. William Mitchell, of Wabaunsee, Kansas, stated to the writer that ""in those days, when buffaloes were plentiful in western Kansas, pretty much everybody made a trip West in the fall and brought back a load of buffalo meat. Everybody had it in abundance as long as buffaloes remained in any considerable number. Very few skins were saved; in fact, hardly any, for the reason that nobody knew how to tan them, and they always spoiled. At first a great many farmers tried to dress the green hides that they brought back, but they could not succeed, and finally gave up trying. Of course, a great deal of the meat killed was wasted, for only the best parts were brought back."" The Wichita (Kansas) _World_ of February 9, 1889, contains the following reference: ""In 1871 and 1872 the buffalo ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, and could be counted by the thousands. The town, then in its infancy, was the headquarters for a vast number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their occupation vigorously during the winter. The buffalo were killed principally for their hides, and daily wagon trains arrived in town loaded with them. Meat was very cheap in those days; fine, tender buffalo steak selling from 1 to 2 cents per pound. * * * The business was quite profitable for a time, but a sudden drop in the price of hides brought them down as low as 25 and 50 cents each. * * * It was a very common thing in those days for people living in Wichita to start out in the morning and return by evening with a wagon load of buffalo meat."" Unquestionably a great many thousand buffaloes were killed annually by the settlers of Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, and the mountain Indians living west of the great range. The number so slain can only be guessed at, for there is absolutely no data on which to found an estimate. Judging merely from the number of people within reach of the range, it may safely be estimated that the total number of buffaloes slaughtered annually to satisfy the wants of this heterogeneous element could not have been less than fifty thousand, and probably was a much higher number. This, for the three years, would make one hundred and fifty thousand, and the grand total would therefore be about as follows: +------------------------------------------------------+ | _The slaughter of the southern herd._ | +------------------------------------------------------+ |Killed by ""professional"" white hunters in | | | 1872, 1873, and 1874 | 3,158,730 | |Killed by Indians, same period | 390,000 | |Killed by settlers and mountain Indians | 150,000 | | | --------- | | Total slaughter in three years | 3,098,730 | +------------------------------------------------------+ These figures seem incredible, but unfortunately there is not the slightest reason for believing they are too high. There are many men now living who declare that during the great slaughter they each killed from twenty-five hundred to three thousand buffaloes every year. With thousands of hunters on the range, and such possibilities of slaughter before each, it is, after all, no wonder that an average of nearly a million and a quarter of buffaloes fell each year during that bloody period. By the close of the hunting season of 1875 the great southern herd had ceased to exist. As a body, it had been utterly annihilated. The main body of the survivors, numbering about ten thousand head, fled southwest, and dispersed through that great tract of wild, desolate, and inhospitable country stretching southward from the Cimarron country across the ""Public Land Strip,"" the Pan-handle of Texas, and the Llano Estacado, or Staked Plain, to the Pecos River. A few small bands of stragglers maintained a precarious existence for a few years longer on the headwaters of the Republican River and in southwestern Nebraska, near Ogalalla, where calves were caught alive as late as 1885. Wild buffaloes were seen in southwestern Kansas for the last time in 1886, and the two or three score of individuals still living in the Canadian River country of the Texas Pan-handle are the last wild survivors of the great Southern herd. The main body of the fugitives which survived the great slaughter of 1871-'74 continued to attract hunters who were very ""hard up,"" who pursued them, often at the risk of their own lives, even into the terrible Llano Estacado. In Montana in 1886 I met on a cattle ranch an ex-buffalo-hunter from Texas, named Harry Andrews, who from 1874 to 1876 continued in pursuit of the scattered remnants of the great southern herd through the Pan-handle of Texas and on into the Staked Plain itself. By that time the market had become completely overstocked with robes, and the prices received by Andrews and other hunters was only 65 cents each for cow robes and $1.15 each for bull robes, delivered on the range, the purchaser providing for their transportation to the railway. But even at those prices, which were so low as to make buffalo killing seem like downright murder, Mr. Andrews assured me that he ""made big money."" On one occasion, when he ""got a stand"" on a large bunch of buffalo, he fired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot, and killed sixty-three buffaloes in about an hour. In 1880 buffalo hunting as a business ceased forever in the Southwest, and so far as can be ascertained, but one successful hunt for robes has been made in that region since that time. That occurred in the fall and winter of 1887, about 100 miles north of Tascosa, Texas, when two parties, one of which was under the leadership of Lee Howard, attacked the only band of buffaloes left alive in the Southwest, and which at that time numbered about two hundred head. The two parties killed fifty-two buffaloes, of which ten skins were preserved entire for mounting. Of the remaining forty-two, the heads were cut off and preserved for mounting and the skins were prepared as robes. The mountable skins were finally sold at the following prices: Young cows, $50 to $60; adult cows, $75 to $100; adult bull, $150. The unmounted heads sold as follows: Young bulls, $25 to $30; adult bulls, $50; young cows, $10 to $12; adult cows, $15 to $25. A few of the choicest robes sold at $20 each, and the remainder, a lot of twenty eight, of prime quality and in excellent condition, were purchased by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company for $350. Such was the end of the great southern herd. In 1871 it contained certainly no fewer than three million buffaloes, and by the beginning of 1875 its existence as a herd had utterly ceased, and nothing but scattered, fugitive bands remained. 7. _The Destruction of the Northern Herd._--Until the building of the Northern Pacific Railway there were but two noteworthy outlets for the buffalo robes that were taken annually in the Northwestern Territories of the United States. The principal one was the Missouri River, and the Yellowstone River was the other. Down these streams the hides were transported by steam-boats to the nearest railway shipping point. For fifty years prior to the building of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1880-'82, the number of robes marketed every year by way of these streams was estimated variously at from fifty to one hundred thousand. A great number of hides taken in the British Possessions fell into the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company, and found a market in Canada. In May, 1881, the Sioux City (Iowa) _Journal_ contained the following information in regard to the buffalo robe ""crop"" of the previous hunting season--the winter of 1880-'81: ""It is estimated by competent authorities that one hundred thousand buffalo hides will be shipped out of the Yellowstone country this season. Two firms alone are negotiating for the transportation of twenty-five thousand hides each. * * * Most of our citizens saw the big load of buffalo hides that the _C. K. Peck_ brought down last season, a load that hid everything about the boat below the roof of the hurricane deck. There were ten thousand hides in that load, and they were all brought out of the Yellowstone on one trip and transferred to the _C. K. Peck_. How such a load could have been piled on the little _Terry_ not even the men on the boat appear to know. It hid every part of the boat, barring only the pilot-house and smoke-stacks. But such a load will not be attempted again. For such boats as ply the Yellowstone there are at least fifteen full loads of buffalo hides and other pelts. Reckoning one thousand hides to three car loads, and adding to this fifty cars for the other pelts, it will take at least three hundred and fifty box-cars to carry this stupendous bulk of peltry East to market. These figures are not guesses, but estimates made by men whose business it is to know about the amount of hides and furs awaiting shipment. ""Nothing like it has ever been known in the history of the fur trade. Last season the output of buffalo hides was above the average, and last year only about thirty thousand hides came out of the Yellowstone country, or less than a third of what is there now awaiting shipment The past severe winter caused the buffalo to bunch themselves in a few valleys where there was pasturage, and there the slaughter went on all winter. There was no sport about it, simply shooting down the famine-tamed animals as cattle might be shot down in a barn-yard. To the credit of the Indians it can be said that they killed no more than they could save the meat from. The greater part of the slaughter was done by white hunters, or butchers rather, who followed the business of killing and skinning buffalo by the mouth, leaving the carcasses to rot."" At the time of the great division made by the Union Pacific Railway the northern body of buffalo extended from the valley of the Platte River northward to the southern shore of Great Slave Lake, eastward almost to Minnesota, and westward to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains. The herds were most numerous along the central portion of this region (see map), and from the Platte Valley to Great Slave Lake the range was continuous. The buffalo population of the southern half of this great range was, according to all accounts, nearly three times as great as that of the northern half. At that time, or, let us say, 1870, there were about four million buffaloes south of the Platte River, and probably about one million and a half north of it. I am aware that the estimate of the number of buffaloes in the great northern herd is usually much higher than this, but I can see no good grounds for making it so. To my mind, the evidence is conclusive that, although the northern herd ranged over such an immense area, it was numerically less than half the size of the overwhelming multitude which actually crowded the southern range, and at times so completely consumed the herbage of the plains that detachments of the United States Army found it difficult to find sufficient grass for their mules and horses.[67] [Note 67: As an instance of this, see _Forest and Stream_, vol. II, p. 184: ""Horace Jones, the interpreter here [Fort Sill], says that on his first trip along the line of the one hundredth meridian, in 1859, accompanying Major Thomas--since our noble old general--they passed continuous herds for over 60 miles, which left so little grass behind them that Major Thomas was seriously troubled about his horses.""] The various influences which ultimately led to the complete blotting out of the great northern herd were exerted about as follows: In the British Possessions, where the country was immense and game of all kinds except buffalo very scarce indeed; where, in the language of Professor Kenaston, the explorer, ""there was a great deal of country around every wild animal,"" the buffalo constituted the main dependence of the Indians, who would not cultivate the soil at all, and of the half-breeds, who would not so long as they could find buffalo. Under such circumstances the buffaloes of the British Possessions were hunted much more vigorously and persistently than those of the United States, where there was such an abundant supply of deer, elk, antelope, and other game for the Indians to feed upon, and a paternal government to support them with annuities besides. Quite contrary to the prevailing idea of the people of the United States, viz., that there were great herds of buffaloes in existence in the Saskatchewan country long after ours had all been destroyed, the herds of British America had been almost totally exterminated by the time the final slaughter of our northern herd was inaugurated by the opening of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1880. The Canadian Pacific Railway played no part whatever in the extermination of the bison in the British Possessions, for it had already taken place. The half-breeds of Manitoba, the Plains Crees of Qu'Appelle, and the Blackfeet of the South Saskatchewan country swept bare a great belt of country stretching east and west between the Rocky Mountains and Manitoba. The Canadian Pacific Railway found only bleaching bones in the country through which it passed. The buffalo had disappeared from that entire region before 1879 and left the Blackfeet Indians on the verge of starvation. A few thousand buffaloes still remained in the country around the headwaters of the Battle River, between the North and South Saskatchewan, but they were surrounded and attacked from all sides, and their numbers diminished very rapidly until all were killed. The latest information I have been able to obtain in regard to the disappearance of this northern band has been kindly furnished by Prof. C. A. Kenaston, who in 1881, and also in 1883, made a thorough exploration of the country between Winnipeg and Fort Edmonton for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. His four routes between the two points named covered a vast scope of country, several hundred miles in width. In 1881, at Moose Jaw, 75 miles southeast of The Elbow of the South Saskatchewan, he saw a party of Cree Indians, who had just arrived from the northwest with several carts laden with fresh buffalo meat. At Fort Saskatchewan, on the North Saskatchewan River, just above Edmonton, he saw a party of English sportsmen who had recently been hunting on the Battle and Red Deer Rivers, between Edmonton and Fort Kalgary, where they had found buffaloes, and killed as many as they cared to slaughter. In one afternoon they killed fourteen, and could have killed more had they been more blood-thirsty. In 1883 Professor Kenaston found the fresh trail of a band of twenty-five or thirty buffaloes at The Elbow of the South Saskatchewan. Excepting in the above instances he saw no further traces of buffalo, nor did he hear of the existence of any in all the country he explored. In 1881 he saw many Cree Indians at Fort Qu'Appelle in a starving condition, and there was no pemmican or buffalo meat at the fort. In 1883, however, a little pemmican found its way to Winnipeg, where it sold at 15 cents per pound; an exceedingly high price. It had been made that year, evidently in the mouth of April, as he purchased it in May for his journey. The first really alarming impression made on our northern herd was by the Sioux Indians, who very speedily exterminated that portion of it which had previously covered the country lying between the North Platte and a line drawn from the center of Wyoming to the center of Dakota. All along the Missouri River from Bismarck to Fort Benton, and along the Yellowstone to the head of navigation, the slaughter went bravely on. All the Indian tribes of that vast region--Sioux, Cheyennes, Crows, Blackfeet, Bloods, Piegans, Assinniboines, Gros Ventres, and Shoshones--found their most profitable business and greatest pleasure (next to scalping white settlers) in hunting the buffalo. It took from eight to twelve buffalo hides to make a covering for one ordinary teepee, and sometimes a single teepee of extra size required from twenty to twenty-five hides. The Indians of our northwestern Territories marketed about seventy-five thousand buffalo robes every year so long as the northern herd was large enough to afford the supply. If we allow that for every skin sold to white traders four others were used in supplying their own wants, which must be considered a very moderate estimate, the total number of buffaloes slaughtered annually by those tribes must have been about three hundred and seventy-five thousand. The end which so many observers had for years been predicting really began (with the northern herd) in 1876, two years after the great annihilation which had taken place in the South, although it was not until four years later that the slaughter became universal over the entire range. It is very clearly indicated in the figures given in a letter from Messrs. I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, Montana, to the writer, dated October 6, 1887, which reads as follows: ""There were sent East from the year 1876 from this point about seventy-five thousand buffalo robes. In 1880 it had fallen to about twenty thousand, in 1883 not more than five thousand, and in 1884 none whatever. We are sorry we can not give you a better record, but the collection of hides which exterminated the buffalo was from the Yellowstone country on the Northern Pacific, instead of northern Montana."" The beginning of the final slaughter of our northern herd may be dated about 1880, by which time the annual robe crop of the Indians had diminished three-fourths, and when summer killing for hairless hides began on a large scale. The range of this herd was surrounded on three sides by tribes of Indians, armed with breech-loading rifles and abundantly supplied with fixed ammunition. Up to the year 1880 the Indians of the tribes previously mentioned killed probably three times as many buffaloes as did the white hunters, and had there not been a white hunter in the whole Northwest the buffalo would have been exterminated there just as surely, though not so quickly by perhaps ten years, as actually occurred. Along the north, from the Missouri River to the British line, and from the reservation in northwestern Dakota to the main divide of the Rocky Mountains, a distance of 550 miles as the crow flies, the country was one continuous Indian reservation, inhabited by eight tribes, who slaughtered buffalo in season and out of season, in winter for robes and in summer for hides and meat to dry. In the Southeast was the great body of Sioux, and on the Southwest the Crows and Northern Cheyennes, all engaged in the same relentless warfare. It would have required a body of armed men larger than the whole United States Army to have withstood this continuous hostile pressure without ultimate annihilation. Let it be remembered, therefore, that the American Indian is as much responsible for the extermination of our northern herd of bison as the American citizen. I have yet to learn of an instance wherein an Indian refrained from excessive slaughter of game through motives of economy, or care for the future, or prejudice against wastefulness. From all accounts the quantity of game killed by an Indian has always been limited by two conditions only--lack of energy to kill more, or lack of more game to be killed. White men delight in the chase, and kill for the ""sport"" it yields, regardless of the effort involved. Indeed, to a genuine sportsman, nothing in hunting is ""sport"" which is not obtained at the cost of great labor. An Indian does not view the matter in that light, and when he has killed enough to supply his wants, he stops, because he sees no reason why he should exert himself any further. This has given rise to the statement, so often repeated, that the Indian killed only enough buffaloes to supply his wants. If an Indian ever attempted, or even showed any inclination, to husband the resources of nature in any way, and restrain wastefulness on _the part of Indians_, it would be gratifying to know of it. The building of the Northern Pacific Railway across Dakota and Montana hastened the end that was fast approaching; but it was only an incident in the annihilation of the northern herd. Without it the final result would have been just the same, but the end would probably not have been reached until about 1888. The Northern Pacific Railway reached Bismarck, Dakota, on the Missouri River, in the year 1876, and from that date onward received for transportation eastward all the buffalo robes and hides that came down the two rivers, Missouri and Yellowstone. Unfortunately the Northern Pacific Railway Company kept no separate account of its buffalo product business, and is unable to furnish a statement of the number of hides and robes it handled. It is therefore impossible to even make an estimate of the total number of buffaloes killed on the northern range during the six years which ended with the annihilation of that herd. In regard to the business done by the Northern Pacific Railway, and the precise points from whence the bulk of the robes were shipped, the following letter from Mr. J. M. Hannaford, traffic manager of the Northern Pacific Railroad, under date of September 3, 1887, is of interest. ""Your communication, addressed to President Harris, has been referred to me for the information desired. ""I regret that our accounts are not so kept as to enable me to furnish you accurate data; but I have been able to obtain the following general information, which may prove of some value to you: ""From the years 1876 and 1880 our line did not extend beyond Bismarck, which was the extreme easterly shipping point for buffalo robes and hides, they being brought down the Missouri River from the north for shipment from that point. In the years 1876, 1877, 1878, and 1879 there were handled at that point yearly from three to four thousand bales of robes, about one-half the bales containing ten robes and the other half twelve robes each. During these years practically no hides were shipped. In 1880 the shipment of hides, dry and untanned, commenced,[68] and in 1881 and 1882 our line was extended west, and the shipping points increased, reaching as far west as Terry and Sully Springs, in Montana. During these years, 1880, 1881, and 1882, which practically finished the shipments of hides and robes, it is impossible for me to give you any just idea of the number shipped. The only figures obtainable are those of 1881, when over seventy-five thousand dry and untanned buffalo hides came down the river for shipment from Bismarck. Some robes were also shipped from this point that year, and a considerable number of robes and hides were shipped from several other shipping points. [Note 68: It is to be noted that hairless hides, _taken from buffaloes killed in summer_, are what the writer refers to. It was not until 1881, when the end was very near, that hunting buffalo in summer as well as winter became a wholesale business. What hunting can be more disgraceful than the slaughter of females and young _in summer_, when skins are almost worthless.] ""The number of pounds of buffalo meat shipped over our line has never cut any figure, the bulk of the meat having been left on the prairie, as not being of sufficient value to pay the cost of transportation. ""The names of the extreme eastern and western stations from which shipments were made are as follows: In 1880, Bismarck was the only shipping point. In 1881, Glendive, Bismarck, and Beaver Creek. In 1882, Terry and Sully Springs, Montana, were the chief shipping points, and in the order named, so far as numbers and amount of shipments are concerned. Bismarck on the east and Forsyth on the west were the two extremities. ""Up to the year 1880, so long as buffalo were killed only for robes, the bands did not decrease very materially; but beginning with that year, when they were killed for their hides as well, a most indiscriminate slaughter commenced, and from that time on they disappeared very rapidly. Up to the year 1881 there were two large bands, one south of the Yellowstone and the other north of that river. In the year mentioned those south of the river were driven north and never returned, having joined the northern band, and become practically extinguished. ""Since 1882 there have, of course, been occasional shipments both of hides and robes, but in such small quantities and so seldom that they cut practically no figure, the bulk of them coming probably from north Missouri points down the river to Bismarck."" In 1880 the northern buffalo range embraced the following streams; The Missouri and all its tributaries, from Port Shaw, Montana, to Fort Bennett, Dakota, and the Yellowstone and all its tributaries. Of this region, Miles City, Montana, was the geographical center. The grass was good over the whole of it, and the various divisions of the great herd were continually shifting from one locality to another, often making journeys several hundred miles at a time. Over the whole of this vast area their bleaching bones lie scattered (where they have not as yet been gathered up for sale) from the Upper Marias and Milk Rivers, near the British boundary, to the Platte, and from the James River, in central Dakota, to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains. Indeed, as late as October, 1887, I gathered up on the open common, within half a mile of the Northern Pacific Railway depot at the city of Helena, the skull, horns, and numerous odd bones of a large bull buffalo which had been killed there. [Illustration: WHERE THE MILLIONS HAVE GONE. From a painting by J. H. Moser in the National Museum.] Over many portions of the northern range the traveler may even now ride for days together without once being out of sight of buffalo carcasses, or bones. Such was the case in 1886 in the country lying between the Missouri and the Yellowstone, northwest of Miles City. Go wherever we might, on divides, into bad lands, creek bottoms, or on the highest plateaus, we always found the inevitable and omnipresent grim and ghastly skeleton, with hairy head, dried-up and shriveled nostrils, half-skinned legs stretched helplessly upon the gray turf, and the bones of the body bleached white as chalk. The year 1881 witnessed the same kind of a stampede for the northern buffalo range that occurred just ten years previously in the south. At that time robes were worth from two to three times as much as they ever had been in the south, the market was very active, and the successful hunter was sure to reap a rich reward as long as the buffaloes lasted. At that time the hunters and hide-buyers estimated that there were five hundred thousand buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City, and that there were still in the entire northern herd not far from one million head. The subsequent slaughter proved that these estimates were probably not far from the truth. In that year Fort Custer was so nearly overwhelmed by a passing herd that a detachment of soldiers was ordered out to turn the herd away from the post. In 1882 an immense herd appeared on the high, level plateau on the north side of the Yellowstone which overlooks Miles City and Fort Keogh in the valley below. A squad of soldiers from the Fifth Infantry was sent up on the bluff, and in less than an hour had killed enough buffaloes to load six four-mule teams with meat. In 1886 there were still about twenty bleaching skeletons lying in a group on the edge of this plateau at the point where the road from the ferry reaches the level, but all the rest had been gathered up. In 1882 there were, so it is estimated by men who were in the country, no fewer than five thousand white hunters and skinners on the northern range. Lieut. J. M. T. Partello declares that ""a cordon of camps, from the Upper Missouri, where it bends to the west, stretched toward the setting sun as far as the dividing line of Idaho, completely blocking in the great ranges of the Milk River, the Musselshell, Yellowstone, and the Marias, and rendering it impossible for scarcely a single bison to escape through the chain of sentinel camps to the Canadian northwest. Hunters of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado drove the poor hunted animals north, directly into the muzzles of the thousands of repeaters ready to receive them. * * * Only a few short years ago, as late as 1883, a herd of about seventy-five thousand crossed the Yellowstone River a few miles south of here [Fort Keogh], scores of Indians, pot-hunters, and white butchers on their heels, bound for the Canadian dominions, where they hoped to find a haven of safety. Alas! not five thousand of that mighty mass ever lived to reach the British border line."" It is difficult to say (at least to the satisfaction of old hunters) which were the most famous hunting grounds on the northern range. Lieutenant Partello states that when he hunted in the great triangle bounded by the three rivers, Missouri, Musselshell, and Yellowstone, it contained, to the best of his knowledge and belief, two hundred and fifty thousand buffaloes. Unquestionably that region yielded an immense number of buffalo robes, and since the slaughter _thousands of tons_ of bones have been gathered up there. Another favorite locality was the country lying between the Powder River and the Little Missouri, particularly the valleys of Beaver and O'Fallon Creeks. Thither went scores of ""outfits"" and hundreds of hunters and skinners from the Northern Pacific Railway towns from Miles City to Glendive. The hunters from the towns between Glendive and Bismarck mostly went south to Cedar Creek and the Grand and Moreau Rivers. But this territory was also the hunting ground of the Sioux Indians from the great reservation farther south. Thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed on the Milk and Marias Rivers, in the Judith Basin, and in northern Wyoming. The method of slaughter has already been fully described under the head of ""the still-hunt,"" and need not be recapitulated. It is some gratification to know that the shocking and criminal wastefulness which was so marked a feature of the southern butchery was almost wholly unknown in the north. Robes were worth from $1.50 to $3.50, according to size and quality, and were removed and preserved with great care. Every one hundred robes marketed represented not more than one hundred and ten dead buffaloes, and even this small percentage of loss was due to the escape of wounded animals which afterward died and were devoured by the wolves. After the skin was taken off the hunter or skinner stretched it carefully upon the ground, inside uppermost, cut his initials in the adherent subcutaneous muscle, and left it until the season for hauling in the robes, which was always done in the early spring, immediately following the hunt. As was the case in the south, it was the ability of a single hunter to destroy an entire bunch of buffalo in a single day that completely annihilated the remaining thousands of the northern herd before the people of the United States even learned what was going on. For example, one hunter of my acquaintance, Vic. Smith, the most famous hunter in Montana, killed one hundred and seven buffaloes in one ""stand,"" in about one hour's time, and without shifting his point of attack. This occurred in the Red Water country, about 100 miles northeast of Miles City, in the winter of 1881-'82. During the same season another hunter, named ""Doc."" Aughl, killed eighty-five buffaloes at one ""stand,"" and John Edwards killed seventy-five. The total number that Smith claims to have killed that season is ""about five thousand."" Where buffaloes were at all plentiful, every man who called himself a hunter was expected to kill between one and two thousand during the hunting season--from November to February--and when the buffaloes were to be found it was a comparatively easy thing to do. During the year 1882 the thousands of bison that still remained alive on the range indicated above, and also marked out on the accompanying map, were distributed over that entire area very generally. In February of that year a Fort Benton correspondent of _Forest and Stream_ wrote as follows: ""It is truly wonderful how many buffalo are still left. Thousands of Indians and hundreds of white men depend on them for a living. At present nearly all the buffalo in Montana are between Milk River and Bear Paw Mountains. There are only a few small bands between the Missouri and the Yellowstone."" There were plenty of buffalo on the Upper Marias River in October, 1882. In November and December there were thousands between the Missouri and the Yellowstone Rivers. South of the Northern Pacific Railway the range during the hunting season of 1882-'83 was thus defined by a hunter who has since written out the ""Confessions of a Buffalo Butcher"" for _Forest and Stream_ (vol. xxiv, p. 489): ""Then [October, 1882] the western limit was defined in a general way by Powder River, and extending eastward well toward the Missouri and south to within 60 or 70 miles of the Black Hills. It embraces the valleys of all tributaries to Powder River from the east, all of the valleys of Beaver Creek, O'Fallon Creek, and the Little Missouri and Moreau Rivers, and both forks of the Cannon Ball for almost half their length. This immense territory, lying almost equally in Montana and Dakota, had been occupied during the winters by many thousands of buffaloes from time immemorial, and many of the cows remained during the summer and brought forth their young undisturbed."" The three hunters composing the party whose record is narrated in the interesting sketch referred to, went out from Miles City on October 23, 1882, due east to the bad lands between the Powder River and O'Fallon Creek, and were on the range all winter. They found comparatively few buffaloes, and secured only two hundred and eighty-six robes, which they sold at an average price of $2.20 each. They saved and marketed a large quantity of meat, for which they obtained 3 cents per pound. They found the whole region in which they hunted fairly infested with Indians and half-breeds, all hunting buffalo. The hunting season which began in October, 1882, and ended in February, 1883, finished the annihilation of the great northern herd, and left but a few small bauds of stragglers, numbering only a very few thousand individuals all told. A noted event of the season was the retreat northward across the Yellowstone of the immense herd mentioned by Lieutenant Partello as containing seventy-five thousand head; others estimated the number at fifty thousand; and the event is often spoken of to-day by frontiersmen who were in that region at the time. Many think that the whole great body went north into British territory, and that there is still a goodly remnant of it in some remote region between the Peace River and the Saskatchewan, or somewhere there, which will yet return to the United States. Nothing could be more illusory than this belief. In the first place, the herd never reached the British line, and, if it had, it would have been promptly annihilated by the hungry Blackfeet and Cree Indians, who were declared to be in a half-starved condition, through the disappearance of the buffalo, as early as 1879. The great herd that ""went north"" was utterly extinguished by the white hunters along the Missouri River and the Indians living north of it. The only vestige of it that remained was a band of about two hundred individuals that took refuge in the labyrinth of ravines and creek bottoms that lie west of the Musselshell between Flat Willow and Box Elder Creeks, and another band of about seventy-five which settled in the bad lands between the head of the Big Dry and Big Porcupine Creeks, where a few survivors were found by the writer in 1886. South of the Northern Pacific Railway, a band of about three hundred settled permanently in and around the Yellowstone National Park, but in a very short time every animal outside of the protected limits of the park was killed, and whenever any of the park buffaloes strayed beyond the boundary they too were promptly killed for their heads and hides. At present the number remaining in the park is believed by Captain Harris, the superintendent, to be about two hundred; about one-third of which is due to breeding in the protected territory. In the southeast the fate of that portion of the herd is well known. The herd which at the beginning of the hunting season of 1883 was known to contain about ten thousand head, and ranged in western Dakota, about half way between the Black Hills and Bismarck, between the Moreau and Grand Rivers, was speedily reduced to about one thousand head. Vic. Smith, who was ""in at the death,"" says there were eleven hundred, others say twelve hundred. Just at this juncture (October, 1883) Sitting Bull and his whole band of nearly one thousand braves arrived from the Standing Sock Agency, and in two days' time slaughtered the entire herd. Vic. Smith and a host of white hunters took part in the killing of this last ten thousand, and he declares that ""when we got through the hunt there was not a hoof left. That wound up the buffalo in the Far West, only a stray bull being seen here and there afterwards."" Curiously enough, not even the buffalo hunters themselves were at the time aware of the fact that the end of the hunting season of 1882-'83 was also the end of the buffalo, at least as an inhabitant of the plains and a source of revenue. In the autumn of 1883 they nearly all outfitted as usual, often at an expense of many hundreds of dollars, and blithely sought ""the range"" that had up to that time been so prolific in robes. The end was in nearly every case the same--total failure and bankruptcy. It was indeed hard to believe that not only the millions, but also the thousands, had actually gone, and forever. I have found it impossible to ascertain definitely the number of robes and hides shipped from the northern range during the last years of the slaughter, and the only reliable estimate I have obtained was made for me, alter much consideration and reflection, by Mr. J. N. Davis, of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mr. Davis was for many years a buyer of furs, robes, and hides on a large scale throughout our Northwestern Territories, and was actively engaged in buying up buffalo robes as long as there were any to buy. In reply to a letter asking for statistics, he wrote me as follows, on September 27, 1887: ""It is impossible to give the exact number of robes and hides shipped out of Dakota and Montana from 1876 to 1883, or the exact number of buffalo in the northern herd; but I will give you as correct an account as any one can. In 1876 it was estimated that there were half a million buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City. In 1881 the Northern Pacific Railroad was built as far west as Glendive and Miles City. At that time the whole country was a howling wilderness, and Indians and wild buffalo were too numerous to mention. The first shipment of buffalo robes, killed by white men, was made that year, and the stations on the Northern Pacific Railroad between Miles City and Mandan sent out about fifty thousand hides and robes. In 1882 the number of hides and robes bought and shipped was about two hundred thousand, and in 1883 forty thousand. In 1884 I shipped from Dickinson, Dakota Territory, the only car load of robes that went East that year, and it was the last shipment ever made."" For a long time the majority of the ex-hunters cherished the fond delusion that the great herd had only ""gone north"" into the British Possessions, and would eventually return in great force. Scores of rumors of the finding of herds floated about, all of which were eagerly believed at first. But after a year or two had gone by without the appearance of a single buffalo, and likewise without any reliable information of the existence of a herd of any size, even in British territory, the butchers of the buffalo either hung up their old Sharps rifles, or sold them for nothing to the gun-dealers, and sought other means of livelihood. Some took to gathering up buffalo bones and selling them by the ton, and others became cowboys. IV. CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BISON. The slaughter of the buffalo down to the very point of extermination has been so very generally condemned, and the general Government has been so unsparingly blamed for allowing such a massacre to take place on the public domain, it is important that the public should know all the facts in the case. To the credit of Congress it must be said that several very determined efforts were made between the years 1871 and 1876 looking toward the protection of the buffalo. The failure of all those well-meant efforts was due to our republican form of Government. Had this Government been a monarchy the buffalo would have been protected; but unfortunately in this case (perhaps the only one on record wherein a king could have accomplished more than the representatives of the people) the necessary act of Congress was so hedged in and beset by obstacles that it never became an accomplished fact. Even when both houses of Congress succeeded in passing a suitable act (June 23, 1874) it went to the President in the last days of the session only to be pigeon-holed, and die a natural death. The following is a complete history of Congressional legislation in regard to the protection of the buffalo from wanton slaughter and ultimate extinction. The first step taken in behalf of this persecuted animal was on March 13, 1871, when Mr. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced a bill (H. R. 157), which was ordered to be printed. Nothing further was done with it. It read as follows: _Be it enacted, etc._, That, excepting for the purpose of using the meat for food or preserving the akin, it shall be unlawful for any person to kill the bison, or buffalo, found anywhere upon the public lands of the United States; and for the violation of this law the offender shall, upon conviction before any court of competent jurisdiction, be liable to a fine of $100 for each animal killed, one-half of which sum shall, upon its collection, be paid to the informer. On February 14, 1872, Mr. Cole, of California, introduced in the Senate the following resolution, which was considered by unanimous consent and agreed to: _Resolved_, That the Committee on Territories be directed to inquire into the expediency of enacting a law for the protection of the buffalo, elk, antelope, and other useful animals running wild in the Territories of the United States against indiscriminate slaughter and extermination, and that they report by bill or otherwise. On February 16, 1872, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill in the Senate (S. 655) restricting the killing of the buffalo upon the public lauds; which was read twice by its title and referred to the Committee on Territories. On April 5, 1872, Mr. B. C. McCormick, of Arizona, made a speech in the House of Representatives, while it was in Committee of the Whole, on the restriction of the killing of buffalo. He mentioned a then recent number of _Harper's Weekly_, in which were illustrations of the slaughter of buffalo, and also read a partly historical extract in regard to the same. He related how, when he was once snow-bound upon the Kansas Pacific Railroad, the buffalo furnished food for himself and fellow-passengers. Then he read the bill introduced by him March 13, 1871, and also copies of letters furnished him by Henry Bergh, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which were sent to the latter by General W. B. Hazen, Lieut. Col. A. G. Brackett, and E. W. Wynkoop. He also read a statement by General Hazen to the effect that he knew of a man who killed ninety-nine buffaloes with his own hand in one day. He also spoke on the subject of cross-breeding the buffalo with common cattle, and read an extract in regard to it from the San Francisco _Post_.[69] [Note 69: Congressional Globe (Appendix), second session Forty-second Congress.] On April 6, 1872, Mr. McCormick asked leave to have printed in the Globe some remarks he had prepared regarding restricting the killing of buffalo, which was granted.[70] [Note 70: Congressional Globe, April 6, 1872, Forty-second Congress, second session.] On January 5, 1874, Mr. Fort, of Illinois, introduced a bill (H. R. 921) to prevent the useless slaughter of buffalo within the Territories of the United States; which was read and referred to the Committee on the Territories.[71] [Note 71: Congressional Record, vol. 2, part 1, Forty-third Congress, p. 371.] On March 10, 1874, this bill was reported to the House from the Committee on the Territories, with a recommendation that it be passed.[72] [Note 72: Congressional Record, vol. 2, part 3, Forty-third Congress, first session, pp. 2105, 2109.] The first section of the bill provided that it shall be unlawful for any person, who is not an Indian, to kill, wound, or in any way destroy any female buffalo of any age, found at large within the boundaries of any of the Territories of the United States. The second section provided that it shall be, in like manner, unlawful for any such person to kill, wound, or destroy in said Territories any greater number of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such person, or than can be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other persons, or for the market. It shall in like manner be unlawful for any such person, or persons, to assist, or be in any manner engaged or concerned in or about such unlawful killing, wounding, or destroying of any such buffaloes; that any person who shall violate the provisions of the act shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of $100 for each offense (and each buffalo so unlawfully killed, wounded, or destroyed shall be and constitute a separate offense), and on a conviction of a second offense may be committed to prison for a period not exceeding thirty days; and that all United States judges, justices, courts, and legal tribunals in said Territories shall have jurisdiction in cases of the violation of the law. Mr. Cox said he had been told by old hunters that it was impossible to tell the sex of a running buffalo; and he also stated that the bill gave preference to the Indians. Mr. Fort said the object was to prevent early extermination; that thousands were annually slaughtered for skins alone, and thousands for their tongues alone; that perhaps hundreds of thousands are killed every year in utter wantonness, with no object for such destruction. He had been told that the sexes could be distinguished while they were running.[73] [Note 73: I know of no greater affront that could be offered to the intelligence of a genuine buffalo-hunter than to accuse him of not knowing enough to tell the sex of a buffalo ""on the run"" by its form alone.--W. T. H.] This bill does not prohibit any person joining in a reasonable chase and hunt of the buffalo. Said Mr. Fort, ""So far as I am advised, gentlemen upon this floor representing all the Territories are favorable to the passage of this bill."" Mr. Cox wanted the clause excepting the Indians from the operations of the bill stricken out, and stated that the Secretary of the Interior had already said to the House that the civilization of the Indian was Impossible while the buffalo remained on the plains. The Clerk read for Mr. McCormick the following extract from the _New Mexican_, a paper published in Santa FÃ©: The buffalo slaughter, which has been going on the past few years on the plains, and which increases every year, is wantonly wicked, and should be stopped by the most stringent enactments and most vigilant enforcements of the law. Killing these noble animals for their hides simply, or to gratify the pleasure of some Russian duke or English lord, is a species of vandalism which can not too quickly be checked. United States surveying parties report that there are two thousand hunters on the plains killing these animals for their hides. One party of sixteen hunters report having killed twenty-eight thousand buffaloes during the past summer. It seems to us there is quite as much reason why the Government should protect the buffaloes as the Indians. Mr. McCormick considered the subject important, and had not a doubt of the fearful slaughter. He read the following extract from a letter that he had received from General Hazen: I know a man who killed with his own hand ninety-nine buffaloes in one day, without taking a pound of the meat. The buffalo for food has an intrinsic value about equal to an average Texas beef, or say $20. There are probably not less than a million of these animals on the western plains. If the Government owned a herd of a million oxen they would at least take steps to prevent this wanton slaughter. The railroads have made the buffalo so accessible as to present a case not dissimilar. He agreed with Mr. Cox that some features of the bill would probably be impracticable, and moved to amend it. He did not believe any bill would entirely accomplish the purpose, but he desired that such wanton slaughter should be stopped. Said he, ""It would have been well both for the Indians and the white men if an enactment of this kind had been placed on our statute-books years ago. * * * I know of no one act that would gratify the red men more."" Mr. Holman expressed surprise that Mr. Cox should make any objection to parts of the measure. The former regarded the bill as ""an effort in a most commendable direction,"" and trusted that it would pass. Mr. Cox said he would not have objected to the bill but from the fact that it was partial in its provisions. He wanted a bill that would impose a penalty on every man, red, white, or black, who may wantonly kill these buffaloes. Mr. Potter desired to know whether more buffaloes were slaughtered by the Indians than by white men. Mr. Fort thought the white men were doing the greatest amount of killing. Mr. Eldridge thought there would be just as much propriety in killing the fish in our rivers as in destroying the buffalo in order to compel the Indians to become civilized. Mr. Conger said: ""As a matter of fact, every man knows the range of the buffalo has grown more and more confined year after year; that they have been driven westward before advancing civilization."" But he opposed the bill! Mr. Hawley, of Connecticut, said: ""I am glad to see this bill. I am in favor of this law, and hope it will pass."" Mr. Lowe favored the bill, and thought that the buffalo ought to be protected for proper utility. Mr. Cobb thought they ought to be protected for the settlers, who depended partly on them for food. Mr. Parker, of Missouri, intimated that the policy of the Secretary of the Interior was a sound one, and that the buffaloes ought to be exterminated, to prevent difficulties in civilizing the Indians. Said Mr. Conger, ""I do not think the measure will tend at all to protect the buffalo."" Mr. McCormick replied: ""This bill will not prevent the killing of buffaloes for any useful purpose, but only their wanton destruction."" Mr. Kasson said: ""I wish to say one word in support of this bill, because I have had some experience as to the manner in which these buffaloes are treated by hunters. The buffalo is a creature of vast utility, * * *. This animal ought to be protected; * * *."" The question being taken on the passage of the bill, there were--ayes 132, noes not counted. So the bill was passed. On June 23, 1874, this bill (H. R. 921) came up in the Senate.[74] [Note 74: Congressional Globe, Vol. 2, part 6, Forty-third Congress, first session.] Mr. Harvey moved, as an amendment, to strike out the words ""who is not an Indian."" Said Mr. Hitchcock, ""That will defeat the bill."" Mr. Frelinghuysen said: ""That would prevent the Indians from killing the buffalo on their own ground. I object to the bill."" Mr. Sargent said: ""I think we can pass the bill in the right shape without objection. Let us take it up. It is a very important one."" Mr. Frelinghuysen withdrew his objection. Mr. Harvey thought it was a very important bill, and withdrew his amendment. The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to a third reading, read the third time, and passed. It went to President Grant for signature, and expired in his hands at the adjournment of that session of Congress. On February 2, 1874, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1689) to tax buffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. On June 10, 1874, Mr. Dawes, from the Committee on Ways and Means, reported back the bill adversely, and moved that it be laid on the table. Mr. Fort asked to have the bill referred to the Committee of the Whole, and it was so referred. On February 2, 1874, Mr. R. C. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced in the House a bill (H. R. 1728) restricting the killing of the bison, or buffalo, on the public lands; which was referred to the Committee on the Public Lands, and never heard of more. On January 31, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1719) to prevent the useless slaughter of buffaloes within the Territories of the United States, which was referred to the Committee on the Territories.[75] [Note 75: Forty-fourth Congress, first session, vol. 4, part 2, pp. 1237-1241.] The Committee on the Territories reported back the bill without amendment on February 23, 1876.[76] Its provisions were in every respect identical with those of the bill introduced by Mr. Fort in 1874, and which passed both houses. [Note 76: Forty-fourth Congress first session, vol. 4, part 1, p. 773.] In support of it Mr. Fort said: ""The intention and object of this bill is to preserve them [the buffaloes] for the use of the Indians, whose homes are upon the public domain, and to the frontiersmen, who may properly use them for food. * * * They have been and are now being slaughtered in large numbers. * * * Thousands of these noble brutes are annually slaughtered out of mere wontonness. * * * This bill, just as it is now presented, passed the last Congress. It was not vetoed, but fell, as I understand, merely for want of time to consider it after having passed both houses."" He also intimated that the Government was using a great deal of money for cattle to furnish the Indians, while the buffalo was being wantonly destroyed, whereas they might be turned to their good. Mr. Crounse wanted the words ""who is not an Indian"" struck out, so as to make the bill general. He thought Indians were to blame for the wanton destruction. Mr. Fort thought the amendment unnecessary, and stated that he was informed that the Indians did not destroy the buffaloes wantonly. Mr. Dunnell thought the bill one of great importance. The Clerk read for him a letter from A. G. Brackett, lieutenant-colonel, Second United States Cavalry, stationed at Omaha Barracks, in which was a very urgent request to have Congress interfere to prevent the wholesale slaughter then going on. Mr. Reagan thought the bill proper and right. He knew from personal experience how the wanton slaughtering was going on, and also that the Indians were _not_ the ones who did it. Mr. Townsend, of New York, saw no reason why a white man should not be allowed to kill a female buffalo as well as an Indian. He said it would be impracticable to have a separate law for each. Mr. Maginnis did not agree with him. He thought the bill ought to pass as it stood. Mr. Throckmorton thought that while the intention of the bill was a good one, yet it was mischievous and difficult to enforce, and would also work hardship to a large portion of our frontier people. He had several objections. He also thought a cow buffalo could not be distinguished at a distance. Mr. Hancock, of Texas, thought the bill an impolicy, and that the sooner the buffalo was exterminated the better. Mr. Fort replied by asking him why all the game--deer, antelope, etc.--was not slaughtered also. Then he went on to state that to exterminate the buffalo would be to starve innocent children of the red man, and to make the latter more wild and savage than he was already. Mr. Baker, of Indiana, offered the following amendment as a substitute for the one already offered: _Provided_, That any white person who shall employ, hire, or procure, directly or indirectly, any Indian to kill any buffalo forbidden to be killed by this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in the manner provided in this act. Mr. Fort stated that a certain clause in his bill covered the object of the amendment. Mr. Jenks offered the following amendment: Strike out in the fourth line of the second section the word ""can"" and insert ""shall;"" and in the second line of the same section insert the word ""wantonly"" before ""kill;"" so that the clause will read: ""That it shall be in like manner unlawful for any such person to wantonly kill, wound, or destroy in the said Territories any greater number of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such person, or than shall be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other persons, or for the market."" Mr. Conger said: ""I think the whole bill is unwise. I think it is a useless measure."" Mr. Hancock said: ""I move that the bill and amendment be laid on the table."" The motion to lay the bill upon the table was defeated, and the amendment was rejected. Mr. Conger called for a division on the passage of the bill. The House divided, and there were--ayes 93, noes 48. He then demanded tellers, and they reported--ayes 104, noes 36. So the bill was passed. On February 25, 1876, the bill was reported to the Senate, and referred to the Committee on Territories, from whence it never returned. On March 20, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 2767) to tax buffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and never heard of afterward. This was the last move made in Congress in behalf of the buffalo. The philanthropic friends of the frontiersman, the Indian, and of the buffalo himself, despaired of accomplishing the worthy object for which they had so earnestly and persistently labored, and finally gave up the fight. At the very time the effort in behalf of buffalo protection was abandoned the northern herd still flourished, and might have been preserved from extirpation. At various times the legislatures of a few of the Western States and Territories enacted laws vaguely and feebly intended to provide some sort of protection to the fast disappearing animals. One of the first was the game law of Colorado, passed in 1872, which declared that the killers of game should not leave any flesh to spoil. The western game laws of those days amounted to about as much as they do now; practically nothing at all. I have never been able to learn of a single instance, save in the Yellowstone Park, wherein a western hunter was prevented by so simple and innocuous a thing as a game law from killing game. Laws were enacted, but they were always left to enforce themselves. The idea of the frontiersman (the average, at least) has always been to kill as much game as possible before some other fellow gets a chance at it, _and before it is all killed off_! So he goes at the game, and as a general thing kills all he can while it lasts, and with it feeds himself and family, his dogs, and even his hogs, to repletion. I knew one Montana man north of Miles City who killed for his own use twenty-six black-tail deer in one season, and had so much more venison than he could consume or give away that a great pile of carcasses lay in his yard until spring and spoiled. During the existence of the buffalo it was declared by many an impossibility to stop or prevent the slaughter. Such an accusation of weakness and imbecility on the part of the General Government is an insult to our strength and resources. The protection of game is now and always has been simply a question of money. A proper code of game laws and a reasonable number of salaried game-wardens, sworn to enforce them and punish all offenses against them, would have afforded the buffalo as much protection as would have been necessary to his continual existence. To be sure, many buffaloes would have been killed on the sly in spite of laws to the contrary, but it was wholesale slaughter that wrought the extermination, and that could easily have been prevented. A tax of 50 cents each on buffalo robes would have maintained a sufficient number of game-wardens to have reasonably regulated the killing, and maintained for an indefinite period a bountiful source of supply of food, and also raiment for both the white man of the plains and the Indian. By judicious management the buffalo could have been made to yield an annual revenue equal to that we now receive from the fur-seals--$100,000 per year. During the two great periods of slaughter--1870-'75 and 1880-'84--the principal killing grounds were as well known as the stock-yards of Chicago. Had proper laws been enacted, and had either the general or territorial governments entered with determination upon the task of restricting the killing of buffaloes to proper limits, their enforcement would have been, in the main, as simple and easy as the collection of taxes. Of course the solitary hunter in a remote locality would have bowled over his half dozen buffaloes in secure defiance of the law; but such desultory killing could not have made much impression on the great mass for many years. The business-like, wholesale slaughter, wherein one hunter would openly kill five thousand buffaloes and market perhaps two thousand hides, could easily have been stopped forever. Buffalo hides could not have been dealt in clandestinely, for many reasons, and had there been no sale for ill-gotten spoils the still-hunter would have gathered no spoils to sell. It was an undertaking of considerable magnitude, and involving a cash outlay of several hundred dollars to make up an ""outfit"" of wagons, horses, arms and ammunition, food, etc., for a trip to ""the range"" after buffaloes. It was these wholesale hunters, both in the North and the South, who exterminated the species, and to say that all such undertakings could not have been effectually prevented by law is to accuse our law-makers and law-officers of imbecility to a degree hitherto unknown. There is nowhere in this country, nor in any of the waters adjacent to it, a living species of any kind which the United States Government can not fully and perpetually protect from destruction by human agencies if it chooses to do so. The destruction of the buffalo was a loss of wealth perhaps twenty times greater than the sum it would have cost to conserve it, and this stupendous waste of valuable food and other products was committed by one class of the American people and permitted by another with a prodigality and wastefulness which even in the lowest savages would be inexcusable. V. COMPLETENESS OF THE EXTERMINATION. (May 1, 1889.) Although the existence of a few widely-scattered individuals enables us to say that the bison is not yet absolutely extinct in a wild state, there is no reason to hope that a single wild and unprotected individual will remain alive ten years hence. The nearer the species approaches to complete extermination, the more eagerly are the wretched fugitives pursued to the death whenever found. Western hunters are striving for the honor (?) of killing the last buffalo, which, it is to be noted, has already been slain about a score of times by that number of hunters. The buffaloes still alive in a wild state are so very few, and have been so carefully ""marked down"" by hunters, it is possible to make a very close estimate of the total number remaining. In this enumeration the small herd in the Yellowstone National Park is classed with other herds in captivity and under protection, for the reason that, had it not been for the protection afforded by the law and the officers of the Park, not one of these buffaloes would be living to-day. Were the restrictions of the law removed now, every one of those animals would be killed within three months. Their heads alone are worth from $25 to $50 each to taxidermists, and for this reason every buffalo is a prize worth the hunter's winning. Had it not been for stringent laws, and a rigid enforcement of them by Captain Harris, the last of the Park buffaloes would have been shot years ago by Vic. Smith, the Rea Brothers, and other hunters, of whom there is always an able contingent around the Park. In the United States the death of a buffalo is now such an event that it is immediately chronicled by the Associated Press and telegraphed all over the country. By reason of this, and from information already in hand, we are able to arrive at a very fair understanding of the present condition of the species in a wild state. In December, 1886, the Smithsonian expedition left about fifteen buffaloes alive in the bad lands of the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, at the head of Big Porcupine Creek. In 1887 three of these were killed by cowboys, and in 1888 two more, the last death recorded being that of an old bull killed near Billings. There are probably eight or ten stragglers still remaining in that region, hiding in the wildest and most broken tracts of the bad lands, as far as possible from the cattle ranches, and where even cowboys seldom go save on a round-up. From the fact that no other buffaloes, at least so far as can be learned, have been killed in Montana during the last two years, I am convinced that the bunch referred to are the last representatives of the species remaining in Montana. In the spring of 1886 Mr. B. C. Winston, while on a hunting trip about 75 miles west of Grand Rapids, Dakota, saw seven buffaloes--five adult animals and two calves; of which he killed one, a large bull, and caught a calf alive. On September 11, 1888, a solitary bull was killed 3 miles from the town of Oakes, in Dickey County. There are still three individuals in the unsettled country lying between that point and the Missouri, which are undoubtedly the only wild representatives of the race east of the Missouri River. On April 28, 1887, Dr. William Stephenson, of the United States Army, wrote me as follows from Pilot Butte, about 30 miles north of Rock Springs, Wyoming: ""There are undoubtedly buffalo within 50 or 60 miles of here, two having been killed out of a band of eighteen some ten days since by cowboys, and another band of four seen near there. I hear from cattlemen of their being seen every year north and northeast of here."" This band was seen once in 1888. In February, 1889, Hon. Joseph M. Carey, member of Congress from Wyoming, received a letter informing him that this band of buffaloes, consisting of twenty-six head, had been seen grazing in the Red Desert of Wyoming, and that the Indians were preparing to attack it. At Judge Carey's request the Indian Bureau issued orders which it was hoped would prevent the slaughter. So, until further developments, we have the pleasure of recording the presence of twenty-six wild buffaloes in southern Wyoming. There are no buffaloes whatever in the vicinity of the Yellowstone Park, either in Wyoming, Montana, or Idaho, save what wander out of that reservation, and when any do, they are speedily killed. There is a rumor that there are ten or twelve mountain buffaloes still on foot in Colorado, in a region called Lost Park, and, while it lacks confirmation, we gladly accept it as a fact. In 1888 Mr. C. B. Cory, of Boston, saw in Denver, Colorado, eight fresh buffalo skins, which it was said had come from the region named above. In 1885 there was a herd of about forty ""mountain buffalo"" near South Park, and although some of the number may still survive, the indications are that the total number of wild buffaloes in Colorado does not exceed twenty individuals. In Texas a miserable remnant of the great southern herd still remains in the ""Pan-handle country,"" between the two forks of the Canadian River. In 1886 about two hundred head survived, which number by the summer of 1887 had been reduced to one hundred, or less. In the hunting season of 1887-'88 a ranchman named Lee Howard fitted out and led a strong party into the haunts of the survivors, and killed fifty-two of them. In May, 1888, Mr. C. J. Jones again visited this region for the purpose of capturing buffaloes alive. His party found, from first to last, thirty-seven buffaloes, of which they captured eighteen head, eleven adult cows and seven calves; the greatest feat ever accomplished in buffalo-hunting. It is highly probable that Mr. Jones and his men saw about all the buffaloes now living in the Pan-handle country, and it therefore seems quite certain that not over twenty-five individuals remain. These are so few, so remote, and so difficult to reach, it is to be hoped no one will consider them worth going after, and that they will be left to take care of themselves. It is greatly to be regretted that the State of Texas does not feel disposed to make a special effort for their protection and preservation. In regard to the existence of wild buffaloes in the British Possessions, the statements of different authorities are at variance, by far the larger number holding the opinion that there are in all the Northwest Territory only a few almost solitary stragglers. But there is still good reason for the hope, and also the belief, that there still remain in Athabasca, between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers, at least a few hundred ""wood buffalo."" In a very interesting and well-considered article in the London _Field_ of November 10, 1888, Mr. Miller Christy quotes all the available positive evidence bearing on this point, and I gladly avail myself of the opportunity to reproduce it here: ""The Hon. Dr. Schulz, in the recent debate on the Mackenzie River basin, in the Canadian senate, quoted Senator Hardisty, of Edmonton, of the Hudson's Bay Company, to the effect that the wood buffalo still existed in the region in question. 'It was,' he said, 'difficult to estimate how many; but probably five or six hundred still remain in scattered bands.' There had been no appreciable difference in their numbers, he thought, during the last fifteen years, as they could not be hunted on horseback, on account of the wooded character of the country, and were, therefore, very little molested. They are larger than the buffalo of the great plains, weighing at least 150 pounds more. They are also coarser haired and straighter horned. ""The doctor also quoted Mr. Frank Oliver, of Edmonton, to the effect that the wood buffalo still exists in small numbers between the Lower Peace and Great Slave Rivers, extending westward from the latter to the Salt River in latitude 60 degrees, and also between the Peace and Athabasca Rivers. He states that 'they are larger than the prairie buffalo, and the fur is darker, but practically they are the same animal.' ...Some buffalo meat is brought in every winter to the Hudson's Bay Company's posts nearest the buffalo ranges. ""Dr. Schulz further stated that he had received the following testimony from Mr. Donald Ross, of Edmonton: The wood buffalo still exists in the localities named. About 1870 one was killed as far west on Peace River as Port Dunvegan. They are quite different from the prairie buffalo, being nearly double the size, as they will dress fully 700 pounds."" It will be apparent to most observers, I think, that Mr. Ross's statement in regard to the size of the wood buffalo is a random shot. In a private letter to the writer, under date of October 22, 1887, Mr. Harrison S. Young, of the Hudson's Bay Company's post at Edmonton, writes as follows: ""The buffalo are not yet extinct in the Northwest. There are still some stray ones on the prairies away to the south of this, but they must be very few. I am unable to find any one who has personal knowledge of the killing of one during the last two years, though I have since the receipt of your letter questioned a good many half-breeds on the subject. In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, there are still a few wood buffalo killed every year, but they are fast diminishing in numbers and are also becoming very shy."" In his ""Manitoba and the Great Northwest"" Prof. John Macoun has this to say regarding the presence of the wood buffalo in the region referred to: ""The wood buffalo, when I was on the Peace River in 1875, were confined to the country lying between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers north of latitude 57Â° 30', or chiefly in the Birch Hills. They were also said to be in some abundance on the Salt and Hay Rivers, running into the Save River north of Peace River. The herds thirteen years ago [now nineteen] were supposed to number about one thousand, all told. I believe many still exist, as the Indians of that region eat fish, which are much easier procured than either buffalo or moose, and the country is much too difficult for white men."" All this evidence, when carefully considered, resolves itself into simply this and no more: The only evidence in favor of the existence of any live buffaloes between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers is in the form of very old rumors, most of them nearly fifteen years old; time enough for the Indians to have procured fire-arms in abundance and killed all those buffaloes two or three times over. Mr. Miller Christy takes ""the mean of the estimates,"" and assumes that there are now about five hundred and fifty buffaloes in the region named. If we are to believe in the existence there of any stragglers his estimate is a fair one, and we will gladly accept it. The total is therefore as follows: +-------------------------------------------------+ | _Number of American bison running wild | | and unprotected on January 1, 1889._ | +-------------------------------------------------+ |In the Pan-handle of Texas | 25| |In Colorado | 20| |In southern Wyoming | 26| |In the Musselshell country, Montana | 10| |In western Dakota | 4| | |---| | Total number in the United States | 85| |In Athabasca, Northwest Territory (estimated)|550| | |---| | Total in all North America |635| +-------------------------------------------------+ Add to the above the total number already recorded in captivity (256) and those under Government protection in the Yellowstone Park (200), and the whole number of individuals of _Bison americanus_ now living is 1,091. From this time it is probable that many rumors of the sudden appearance of herds of buffaloes will become current. Already there have been three or four that almost deserve special mention. The first appeared in March, 1887, when various Western newspapers published a circumstantial account of how a herd of about three hundred buffaloes swam the Missouri River about 10 miles above Bismarck, near the town of Painted Woods, and ran on in a southwesterly direction. A letter of inquiry, addressed to Mr. S. A. Peterson, postmaster at Painted Woods, elicited the following reply: ""The whole rumor is false, and without any foundation. I saw it first in the ---- newspaper, where I believe it originated."" In these days of railroads and numberless hunting parties, there is not the remotest possibility of there being anywhere in the United States a herd of a hundred, or even fifty, buffaloes which has escaped observation. Of the eighty-five head still existing in a wild state it may safely be predicted that not even one will remain alive five years hence. A buffalo is now so great a prize, and by the ignorant it is considered so great an honor(!) to kill one, that extraordinary exertions will be made to find and shoot down without mercy the ""last buffalo."" There is no possible chance for the race to be perpetuated in a wild state, and in a few years more hardly a bone will remain above ground to mark the existence of the must prolific mammalian species that ever existed, so far as we know. VI. EFFECTS OF THE EXTERMINATION. The buffalo supplied the Indian with food, clothing, shelter, bedding, saddles, ropes, shields, and innumerable smaller articles of use and ornament In the United States a paternal government takes the place of the buffalo in supplying all these wants of the red man, and it costs several millions of dollars annually to accomplish the task. The following are the tribes which depended very largely--some almost wholly--upon the buffalo for the necessities, and many of the luxuries, of their savage life until the Government began to support them: +------------------------------------+ |Sioux |30,561| |Crow | 3,226| |Piegan, Blood, and Blackfeet | 2,026| |Cheyenne | 3,477| |Gros Ventres | 856| |Arickaree | 517| |Mandan | 283| |Bannack and Shoshone | 2,001| |Nez PercÃ© | 1,460| |Assinniboine | 1,688| |Kiowas and Comanches | 2,756| |Arapahoes | 1,217| |Apache | 332| |Ute | 978| |Omaha | 1,160| |Pawnee | 998| |Winnebago | 1,222| | |------| | Total |54,758| +------------------------------------+ This enumeration (from the census of 1886) leaves entirely out of consideration many thousands of Indians living in the Indian Territory and other portions of the Southwest, who drew an annual supply of meat and robes from the chase of the buffalo, notwithstanding the fact that their chief dependence was upon agriculture. The Indians of what was once the buffalo country are not starving and freezing, for the reason that the United States Government supplies them regularly with beef and blankets in lieu of buffalo. Does any one imagine that the Government could not have regulated the killing of buffaloes, and thus maintained the supply, for far less money than it now costs to feed and clothe those 54,758 Indians! How is it with the Indians of the British Possessions to-day? Prof. John Maconn writes as follows in his ""Manitoba and the Great Northwest,"" page 342: ""During the last three years [prior to 1883] the great herds have been kept south of our boundary, and, as the result of this, our Indians have been on the verge of starvation. When the hills were covered with countless thousands [of buffaloes] in 1877, the Blackfeet were dying of starvation in 1879."" During the winter of 1886-'87, destitution and actual starvation prevailed to an alarming extent among certain tribes of Indians in the Northwest Territory who once lived bountifully on the buffalo. A terrible tale of suffering in the Athabasca and Peace River country has recently (1888) come to the minister of the interior of the Canadian government, in the form of a petition signed by the bishop of that diocese, six clergymen and missionaries, and several justices of the peace. It sets forth that ""owing to the destruction of game, the Indians, both last winter and last summer, have been in a state of starvation. They are now in a complete state of destitution, and are utterly unable to provide themselves with clothing, shelter, ammunition, or food for the coming winter."" The petition declares that on account of starvation, and consequent cannibalism, a party of twenty-nine Cree Indians was reduced to three in the winter of 1886.[77] Of the Fort Chippewyan Indians, between twenty and thirty starved to death last winter, and the death of many more was hastened by want of food and by famine diseases. Many other Indians--Crees, Beavers, and Chippewyans--at almost all points where there are missions or trading posts, would certainly have starved to death but for the help given them by the traders and missionaries at those places. It is now declared by the signers of the memorial that scores of families, having lost their heads by starvation, are now perfectly helpless, and during the coming winter must either starve to death or eat one another unless help comes. Heart-rending stories of suffering and cannibalism continue to come in from what was once the buffalo plains. [Note 77: It was the Cree Indians who used to practice impounding buffaloes, slaughtering a penful of two hundred head at a time with most fiendish glee, and leaving all but the very choicest of the meat to putrefy.] If ever thoughtless people were punished for their reckless improvidence, the Indians and half-breeds of the Northwest Territory are now paying the penalty for the wasteful slaughter of the buffalo a few short years ago. The buffalo is his own avenger, to an extent his remorseless slayers little dreamed he ever could be. VII. PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES FROM ABSOLUTE EXTINCTION. There is reason to fear that unless the United States Government takes the matter in hand and makes a special effort to prevent it, the pure-blood bison will be lost irretrievably through mixture with domestic breeds and through in-and-in breeding. The fate of the Yellowstone Park herd is, to say the least, highly uncertain. A distinguished Senator, who is deeply interested in legislation for the protection of the National Park reservation, has declared that the pressure from railway corporations, which are seeking a foot-hold in the park, has become so great and so aggressive that he fears the park will ""eventually be broken up."" In any such event, the destruction of the herd of park buffaloes would be one of the very first results. If the park is properly maintained, however, it is to be hoped that the buffaloes now in it will remain there and increase indefinitely. As yet there are only two captive buffaloes in the possession of the Government, viz, those in the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum, presented by Hon. E. G. Blackford, of New York. The buffaloes now in the Zoological Gardens of the country are but few in number, and unless special pains be taken to prevent it, by means of judicious exchanges, from time to time, these will rapidly deteriorate in size, and within a comparatively short time run out entirely, through continued in-and-in breeding. It is said that even the wild aurochs in the forests of Lithuania are decreasing in size and, in number from this cause. With private owners of captive buffaloes, the temptations to produce cross-breeds will be so great that it is more than likely the breeding of pure-blood buffaloes will be neglected. Indeed, unless some stockman like Mr. C. J. Jones takes particular pains to protect his full blood buffaloes, and keep the breed absolutely pure, in twenty years there will not be a pure-blood animal of that species on any stock farm in this country. Under existing conditions, the constant tendency of the numerous domestic forms is to absorb and utterly obliterate the few wild ones. If we may judge from the examples set as by European governments, it is clearly the duty of our Government to act in this matter, and act promptly, with a degree of liberality and promptness which can not be otherwise than highly gratifying to every American citizen and every friend of science throughout the world. The Fiftieth Congress, at its last session, responded to the call made upon it, and voted $200,000 for the establishment of a National Zoological Park in the District of Columbia on a grand scale. One of the leading purposes it is destined to serve is the preservation and breeding in comfortable, and so far as space is concerned, luxurious captivity of a number of fine specimens of every species of American quadruped now threatened with extermination.[78] [Note 78: It is indeed an unbounded satisfaction to be able to now record the fact that this important task, in which every American citizen has a personal interest, is actually to be undertaken. Last year we could only way it ought to be undertaken. In its accomplishment, the Government expects the co-operation of private individuals all over the country in the form of gifts of desirable living animals, for no government could afford to purchase all the animals necessary for a great Zoological Garden, provide for their wants in a liberal way, and yet give the public free access to the collection, as is to be given to the National Zoological Park.] At least eight or ten buffaloes of pure breed should be secured very soon by the Zoological Park Commission, by gift if possible, and cared for with special reference to keeping the breed absolutely pure, and _keeping the herd from deteriorating and dying out through in-and-in breeding_. The total expense would be trifling in comparison with the importance of the end to be gained, and in that way we might, in a small measure, atone for our neglect of the means which would have protected the great herds from extinction. In this way, by proper management, it will be not only possible but easy to preserve fine living representatives of this important species for centuries to come. The result of continuing in-breeding is certain extinction. Its progress may be so slow as to make no impression upon the mind of a herd-owner, but the end is only a question of time. The fate of a majority of the herds of British wild cattle (_Bos urus_) warn us what to expect with the American bison under similar circumstances. Of the fourteen herds of wild cattle which were in existence in England and Scotland during the early part of the present century, direct descendants of the wild herds found in Great Britain, nine have become totally extinct through in breeding. The five herds remaining are those at Somerford Park, Blickling Hall, Woodbastwick, Chartley, and Chillingham. PART III.--THE SMITHSONIAN EXPEDITION FOR MUSEUM SPECIMENS. I. THE EXPLORATION. During the first three months of the year 1886 it was ascertained by the writer, then chief taxidermist of the National Museum, that the extermination of the American bison had made most alarming progress. By extensive correspondence it was learned that the destruction of all the large herds, both North and South, was already an accomplished fact. While it was generally supposed that at least a few thousand individuals still inhabited the more remote and inaccessible regions of what once constituted the great northern buffalo range, it was found that the actual number remaining in the whole United States was probably less than three hundred. By some authorities who were consulted it was considered an impossibility to procure a large series of specimens anywhere in this country, while others asserted positively that there were no wild buffaloes south of the British possessions save those in the Yellowstone National Park. Canadian authorities asserted with equal positiveness that none remained in their territory. A careful inventory of the specimens in the collection of the National Museum revealed the fact that, with the exception of one mounted female skin, another unmounted, and one mounted skeleton of a male buffalo, the Museum was actually without presentable specimens of this most important and interesting mammal. Besides those mentioned above, the collection contained only two old, badly mounted, and dilapidated skins, (one of which had been taken in summer, and therefore was not representative), an incomplete skeleton, some fragmentary skulls of no value, and two mounted heads. Thus it appeared that the Museum was unable to show a series of specimens, good or bad, or even one presentable male of good size. In view of this alarming state of affairs, coupled with the already declared extinction of _Bison americanus_, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, determined to send a party into the field at once to find wild buffalo, if any were still living, and in case any were found to collect a number of specimens. Since it seemed highly uncertain whether any other institution, or any private individual, would have the opportunity to collect a large supply of specimens before it became too late, it was decided by the Secretary that the Smithsonian Institution should undertake the task of providing for the future as liberally as possible. For the benefit of the smaller scientific museums of the country, and for others which will come into existence during the next half century, it was resolved to collect at all hazards, in case buffalo could be found, between eighty and one hundred specimens of various kinds, of which from twenty to thirty should be skins, an equal number should be complete skeletons, and of skulls at least fifty. In view of the great scarcity of buffalo and the general belief that it might be a work of some months to find any specimens, even if it were possible to find any at all, it was determined not to risk the success of the undertaking by delaying it until the regular autumn hunting season, but to send a party into the field at once to prosecute a search. It was resolved to discover at all hazards the whereabouts of any buffalo that might still remain in this country in a wild state, and, if possible, to reach them before the shedding of their winter pelage. It very soon became apparent, however, that the latter would prove an utter impossibility. Late in the month of April a letter was received from Dr. J. C. Merrill, United States Army, dated at Huntley, Montana, giving information of reports that buffalo were still to be found in three localities in the Northwest, viz: on the headwaters of the Powder River, Wyoming; in Judith Basin, Montana; and on Big Dry Creek, also in Montana. The reports in regard to the first two localities proved to be erroneous. It was ascertained to a reasonable certainty that there still existed in southwestern Dakota a small band of six or eight wild buffaloes, while from the Pan-handle of Texas there came reports of the existence there, in small scattered hands, of about two hundred head. The buffalo known to be in Dakota were far too few in number to justify a long and expensive search, while those in Texas, on the Canadian River, were too difficult to reach to make it advisable to hunt them save as a last resort. It was therefore decided to investigate the localities named in the Northwest. Through the courtesy of the Secretary of War, an order was sent to the officer commanding the Department of Dakota, requesting him to furnish the party, through the officers in command at Forts Keogh, Maginnis, and McKinney, such field transportation, escort, and camp equipage as might be necessary, and also to sell to the party such commissary stores as might be required, at cost price, plus 10 per cent. The Secretary of the Interior also favored the party with an order, directing all Indian agents, scouts, and others in the service of the Department to render assistance as far as possible when called upon. In view of the public interest attaching to the results of the expedition, the railway transportation of the party to and from Montana was furnished entirely without cost to the Smithsonian Institution. For these valuable courtesies we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to Mr. Frank Thomson, of the Pennsylvania Railroad; Mr. Roswell Miller, of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; and Mr. Robert Harris, of the Northern Pacific. Under orders from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the writer left Washington on May 6, accompanied by A. H. Forney, assistant in the department of taxidermy, and George H. Hedley, of Medina, New York. It had been decided that Miles City, Montana, might properly be taken as the first objective point, and that town was reached on May 9. Diligent inquiry in Miles City and at Fort Keogh, 2 miles distant, revealed the fact that no one knew of the presence of any wild buffalo anywhere in the Northwest, save within the protected limits of the Yellowstone Park. All inquiries elicited the same reply: ""There are no buffalo any more, and you can't get any anywhere."" Many persons who were considered good authority declared most positively that there was not a live buffalo in the vicinity of Big Dry Creek, nor anywhere between the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers. An army officer from Fort Maginnis testified to the total absence of buffalo in the Judith Basin, and ranchmen from Wyoming asserted that none remained in the Powder River country. Just at this time it was again reported to us, and most opportunely confirmed by Mr. Henry E. Phillips, owner of the =LU=-bar ranch on Little Dry Creek, that there still remained a chance to find a few buffalo in the country lying south of the Big Dry. On the other hand, other persons who seemed to be fully informed regarding that very region and the animal life it contained, assured us that not a single buffalo remained there, and that a search in that direction would prove fruitless. But the balance of evidence, however, seemed to lie in favor of the Big Dry country, and we resolved to hunt through it with all possible dispatch. On the afternoon of May 13 we crossed the Yellowstone and started northwest up the trail which leads along Sunday Creek. Our entire party consisted of the two assistants already mentioned, a non-commissioned officer, Sergeant Garone, and four men from the Fifth Infantry acting as escort; Private Jones, also from the Fifth Infantry, detailed to act as our cook, and a teamster. Our conveyance consisted of a six-mule team, which, like the escort, was ordered out for twenty days only, and provided accordingly. Before leaving Miles City we purchased two saddle-horses for use in hunting, the equipments for which were furnished by the ordnance department at Fort Keogh. During the first two days' travel through the bad lands north of the Yellowstone no mammals were seen save prairie-dogs and rabbits. On the third day a few antelope were seen, but none killed. It is to be borne in mind that this entire region is absolutely treeless everywhere save along the margins of the largest streams. Bushes are also entirely absent, with the exception of sage-brush, and even that does not occur to any extent on the divides. On the third day two young buck antelopes were shot at the Red Buttes. One had already commenced to shed his hair, but the other had not quite reached that point. We prepared the skin of the first specimen and the skeleton of the other. This was the only good antelope skin we obtained in the spring, those of all the other specimens taken being quite worthless on account of the looseness of the hair. During the latter part of May, and from that time on until the long winter hair is completely shed, it falls off in handfuls at the slightest pressure, leaving the skin clad only with a thin growth of new, mouse-colored hair an eighth of an inch long. After reaching Little Dry Creek and hunting through the country on the west side of it nearly to its confluence with the Big Dry we turned southwest, and finally went into permanent camp on Phillips Creek, 8 miles above the =LU=-bar ranch and 4 miles from the Little Dry. At that point we were about 80 miles from Miles City. From information furnished us by Mr. Phillips and the cowboys in his employ, we were assured that about thirty-five head of buffalo ranged in the bad lands between Phillips Creek and the Musselshell River and south of the Big Dry. This tract of country was about 40 miles long from east to west by 25 miles wide, and therefore of about 1,000 square miles in area. Excepting two temporary cowboy camps it was totally uninhabited by man, treeless, without any running streams, save in winter and spring, and was mostly very hilly and broken. In this desolate and inhospitable country the thirty-five buffaloes alluded to had been seen, first on Sand Creek, then at the head of the Big Porcupine, again near the Musselshell, and latest near the head of the Little Dry. As these points were all from 15 to 30 miles distant from each other, the difficulty of finding such a small herd becomes apparent. Although Phillips Creek was really the eastern boundary of the buffalo country, it was impossible for a six-mule wagon to proceed beyond it, at least at that point. Having established a permanent camp, the Government wagon and its escort returned to Fort Keogh, and we proceeded to hunt through the country between Sand Creek and the Little Dry. The absence of nearly all the cowboys on the spring round-up, which began May 20, threatened to be a serious drawback to us, as we greatly needed the services of a man who was acquainted with the country. We had with us as a scout and guide a Cheyenne Indian, named Dog, but it soon became apparent that he knew no more about the country than we did. Fortunately, however, we succeeded in occasionally securing the services of a cowboy, which was of great advantage to us. It was our custom to ride over the country daily, each day making a circuit through a new locality, and covering as much ground as it was possible to ride over in a day. It was also our custom to take trips of from two to four days in length, during which we carried our blankets and rations upon our horses and camped wherever night overtook us, provided water could be found. Our first success consisted in the capture of a buffalo calf, which from excessive running had become unable to keep up with its mother, and had been left behind. The calf was caught alive without any difficulty, and while two of the members of our party carried it to camp across a horse, the other two made a vigorous effort to discover the band of adult animals. The effort was unsuccessful, for, besides the calf, no other buffaloes were seen. Ten days after the above event two bull buffaloes were met with on the Little Dry, 15 miles above the =LU=-bar ranch, one of which was overtaken and killed, but the other got safely away. The shedding of the winter coat was in full progress. On the head, neck, and shoulders the old hair had been entirely replaced by the new, although the two coats were so matted together that the old hair clung in tangled masses to the other. The old hair was brown and weather-beaten, but the new, which was from 3 to 6 inches long, had a peculiar bluish-gray appearance. On the head the new hair was quite black, and contrasted oddly with the lighter color. On the body and hind quarters there were large patches of skin which were perfectly bare, between which lay large patches of old, woolly, brown hair. This curious condition gave the animal a very unkempt and ""seedy"" appearance, the effect of which was heightened by the long, shaggy locks of old, weather beaten hair which clung to the new coat of the neck and shoulders like tattered signals of distress, ready to be blown away by the first gust of wind. This specimen was a large one, measuring 5 feet 4 inches in height. Inasmuch as the skin was not in condition to mount, we took only the skeleton, entire, and the skin of the head and neck. The capture of the calf and the death of this bull proved conclusively that there were buffaloes in that region, and also that they were breeding in comparative security. The extent of the country they had to range over made it reasonably certain that their number would not be diminished to any serious extent by the cowboys on the spring round-up, although it was absolutely certain that in a few months the members of that band would all be killed. The report of the existence of a herd of thirty-five head was confirmed later by cowboys, who had actually seen the animals, and killed two of them merely for sport, as usual. They saved a few pounds of hump meat, and all the rest became food for the wolves and foxes. It was therefore resolved to leave the buffaloes entirely unmolested until autumn, and then, when the robes would be in the finest condition, return for a hunt on a liberal scale. Accordingly, it was decided to return to Washington without delay, and a courier was dispatched with a request for transportation to carry our party back to Fort Keogh. While awaiting the arrival of the wagons, a cowboy in the employ of the Phillips Land and Cattle Company killed a solitary bull buffalo about 15 miles west of our camp, near Sand Creek. This animal had completely shed the hair on his body and hind quarters. In addition to the preservation of his entire skeleton, we prepared the skin also, as an example of the condition of the buffalo immediately after shedding. On June 6 the teams from Fort Keogh arrived, and we immediately returned to Miles City, taking with us our live buffalo calf, two fresh buffalo skeletons, three bleached skeletons, seven skulls, one skin entire, and one head skin, in addition to a miscellaneous collection of skins and skeletons of smaller mammals and birds. On reaching Miles City we hastily packed and shipped our collection, and, taking the calf with us, returned at once to Washington. II. THE HUNT. On September 24 I arrived at Miles City a second time, fully equipped for a protracted hunt for buffalo; this time accompanied only by W. Harvey Brown, a student of the University of Kansas, as field assistant, having previously engaged three cowboys as guides and hunters--Irwin Boyd, James McNaney, and L. S. Russell. Messrs. Boyd and Russell were in Miles City awaiting my arrival, and Mr. McNaney joined us in the field a few days later. Mr. Boyd acted as my foreman during the entire hunt, a position which he filled to my entire satisfaction. Thanks to the energy and good-will of the officers at Fort Keogh, of which Lieutenant-Colonel Cochran was then in command, our transportation, camp equipage, and stores were furnished without an hour's delay. We purchased two months' supplies of commissary stores, a team, and two saddle-horses, and hired three more horses, a light wagon, and a set of double harness. Each of the cowboys furnished one horse; so that in our outfit we had ten head, a team, and two good saddle-horses for each hunter. The worst feature of the whole question of subsistence was the absolute necessity of hauling a supply of grain from Miles City into the heart of the buffalo country for our ten horses. For such work as they had to encounter it was necessary to feed them constantly and liberally with oats in order to keep them in condition to do their work. We took with us 2,000 pounds of oats, and by the beginning of November as much more had to be hauled up to us. Thirty six hours after our arrival in Miles City our outfit was complete, and we crossed the Yellowstone and started up the Sunday Creek trail. We had from Fort Keogh a six-mule team, an escort of four men, in charge of Sergeant Bayliss, and an old veteran of more than twenty years' service, from the Fifth Infantry, Private Patrick McCanna, who was detailed to act as cook and camp-guard for our party during our stay in the field. On September 29 we reached Tow's ranch, the =HV=, on Big Dry Creek (erroneously called Big Timber Creek on most maps of Montana), at the mouth of Sand Creek, which here flows into it from the southwest. This point is said to be 90 miles from Miles City. Here we received our freight from the six-mule wagon, loaded it with bleached skeletons and skulls of buffalo, and started it back to the post. One member of the escort, Private C. S. West, who was then on two months' furlough, elected to join our party for the hunt, and accordingly remained with us to its close. Leaving half of our freight stored at the =HV= ranch, we loaded the remainder upon our own wagon, and started up Sand Creek. [Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF THE HUNT FOR BUFFALO. MONTANA 1886.] At this point the hunt began. As the wagon and extra horses proceeded up the Sand Creek trail in the care of W. Harvey Brown, the three cowboys and I paired off, and while two hunted through the country along the south side of the creek, the others took the north. The whole of the country bordering Sand Creek, quite up to its source, consists of rugged hills and ridges, which sometimes rise to considerable height, cut between by great yawning ravines and hollows, such as persecuted game loves to seek shelter in. Inasmuch as the buffalo we were in search of had been seen hiding in those ravines, it became necessary to search through them with systematic thoroughness; a proceeding which was very wearing upon our horses. Along the south side of Sand Creek, near its source, the divide between it and Little Dry Creek culminates in a chain of high, flat-topped buttes, whose summits bear a scanty growth of stunted pines, which serve to make them conspicuous landmarks. On some maps these insignificant little buttes are shown as mountains, under the name of ""Piny Buttes."" It was our intention to go to the head of Sand Creek, and beyond, in case buffaloes were not found earlier. Immediately westward of its source there is a lofty level plateau, about 3 miles square, which, by common consent, we called the High Divide. It is the highest ground anywhere between the Big Dry and the Yellowstone, and is the starting point of streams that run northward into the Missouri and Big Dry, eastward into Sand Creek and the Little Dry, southward into Porcupine Creek and the Yellowstone, and westward into the Musselshell. On three sides--north, east, and south--it is surrounded by wild and rugged butte country, and its sides are scored by intricate systems of great yawning ravines and hollows, steep-sided and very deep, and bad lands of the worst description. By the 12th of October the hunt had progressed up Sand Creek to its source, and westward across the High Divide to Calf Creek, where we found a hole of wretchedly bad water and went into permanent camp. We considered that the spot we selected would serve us as a key to the promising country that lay on three sides of it, and our surmise that the buffalo were in the habit of hiding in the heads of those great ravines around the High Divide soon proved to be correct. Our camp at the head of Calf Creek was about 20 miles east of the Musselshell River, 40 miles south of the Missouri, and about 135 miles from Miles City, as the trail ran. Four miles north of us, also on Calf Creek, was the line camp of the =STV= ranch, owned by Messrs. J. H. Conrad & Co., and 18 miles east, near the head of Sand Creek, was the line camp of the =N=-bar ranch, owned by Mr. Newman. At each of these camps there were generally from two to four cowboys. From all these gentlemen we received the utmost courtesy and hospitality on all occasions, and all the information in regard to buffalo which it was in their power to give. On many occasions they rendered us valuable assistance, which is hereby gratefully acknowledged. We saw no buffalo, nor any signs of any, until October 13. On that day, while L. S. Russell was escorting our second load of freight across the High Divide, he discovered a band of seven buffaloes lying in the head of a deep ravine. He fired upon them, but killed none, and when they dashed away he gave chase and followed them 2 or 3 miles. Being mounted on a tired horse, which was unequal to the demands of the chase, he was finally distanced by the herd, which took a straight course and ran due south. As it was then nearly night, nothing further could be done that day except to prepare for a vigorous chase on the morrow. Everything was got in perfect readiness for an early start, and by daybreak the following morning the three cowboys and the writer were mounted on our best horses, and on our way through the bad lands to take up the trail of the seven buffaloes. Shortly after sunrise we found the trail, not far from the head of Calf Creek, and followed it due south. We left the rugged butte region behind us, and entered a tract of country quite unlike anything we had found before. It was composed of a succession of rolling hills and deep hollows, smooth enough on the surface, to all appearances, but like a desert of sand-hills to traverse. The dry soil was loose and crumbly, like loose ashes or scoriÃ¦, and the hoofs of our horses sank into it half-way to the fetlocks at every step. But there was another feature which was still worse. The whole surface of the ground was cracked and seamed with a perfect net-work of great cracks, into which our horses stepped every yard or so, and sank down still farther, with many a tiresome wrench of the joints. It was terrible ground to go over. To make it as bad as possible, a thick growth of sage-brush or else grease-wood was everywhere present for the horses to struggle through, and when it came to dragging a loaded wagon across that 12-mile stretch of ""bad grounds"" or ""gumbo ground,"" as it was called, it was killing work. But in spite of the character of this ground, in one way it was a benefit to us. Owing to its looseness on the surface we were able to track the buffaloes through it with the greatest ease, whereas on any other ground in that country it would have been almost impossible. We followed the trail due south for about 20 miles, which brought us to the head of a small stream called Taylor Creek. Here the bad grounds ended, and in the grassy country which lay beyond, tracking was almost impossible. Just at noon we rode to a high point, and on scanning the hills and hollows with the binocular discovered the buffaloes lying at rest on the level top of a small butte 2 miles away. The original bunch of seven had been joined by an equal number. We crept up to within 200 yards of the buffaloes, which was as close as we could go, fired a volley at them just as they lay, and did not even kill a calf! Instantly they sprang up and dashed away at astonishing speed, heading straight for the sheltering ravines around the High Divide. We had a most exciting and likewise dangerous chase after the herd through a vast prairie-dog town, honey-combed with holes just right for a running horse to thrust a leg in up to the knee and snap it off like a pipe-stem, and across fearfully wide gullies that either had to be leaped or fallen into. McNaney killed a fine old bull and a beautiful two year old, or ""spike"" bull, out of this herd, while I managed to kill a cow and another large old bull, making four for that day, all told. This herd of fourteen head was the largest that we saw during the entire hunt. Two days later, when we were on the spot with the wagon to skin our game and haul in the hides, four more buffaloes were discovered within 2 miles of us, and while I worked on one of the large bull skins to save it from spoiling, the cowboys went after the buffalo, and by a really brilliant exploit killed them all. The first one to fall was an old cow, which was killed at the beginning of the chase, the next was an old bull, who was brought down about 5 miles from the scene of the first attack, then 2 miles farther on a yearling calf was killed. The fourth buffalo, an immense old bull, was chased fully 12 miles before he was finally brought down. The largest bull fell about 8 miles from our temporary camp, in the opposite direction from that in which our permanent camp lay, and at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. There not being time enough in which to skin him completely and reach our rendezvous before dark, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, partly skinned the legs, and came to camp. As early as possible the next morning we drove to the carcass with the wagon, to prepare both skin and skeleton and haul them in. When we reached it we found that during the night a gang of Indians had robbed us of our hard-earned spoil. They had stolen the skin and all the eatable meat, broken up the leg-bones to get at the marrow, and even cut out the tongue. And to injury the skulking thieves had added insult. Through laziness they had left the head unskinned, but on one side of it they had smeared the hair with red war-paint, the other side they had daubed with yellow, and around the base of one horn they had tied a strip of red flannel as a signal of defiance. Of course they had left for parts unknown, and we never saw any signs of them afterward. The gang visited the =LU=-bar ranch a few days later, so we learned subsequently. It was then composed of eleven braves(!), who claimed to be Assinniboines, and were therefore believed to be Piegans, the most notorious horse and cattle thieves in the Northwest. On October 22d Mr. Russell ran down in a fair chase a fine bull buffalo, and killed him in the rough country bordering the High Divide on the south. This was the ninth specimen. On the 26th we made an other trip with the wagon to the Buffalo Buttes, as, for the sake of convenience, we had named the group of buttes near which eight head had already been taken. While Mr. Brown and I were getting the wagon across the bad grounds, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd discovered a solitary bull buffalo feeding in a ravine within a quarter of a mile of our intended camping place, and the former stalked him and killed him at long range. The buffalo had all been attracted to that locality by some springs which lay between two groups of hills, and which was the only water within a radius of about 15 miles. In addition to water, the grass around the Buffalo Buttes was most excellent. During all this time we shot antelope and coyotes whenever an opportunity offered, and preserved the skins and skeletons of the finest until we had obtained a very fine series of both. At this season the pelts of these animals were in the finest possible condition, the hair having attained its maximum length and density, and, being quite new, had lost none of its brightness of color, either by wear or the action of the weather. Along Sand Creek and all around the High Divide antelope were moderately plentiful (but really scarce in comparison with their former abundance), so much so that had we been inclined to slaughter we could have killed a hundred head or more, instead of the twenty that we shot as specimens and for their flesh. We have it to say that from first to last not an antelope was killed which was not made use of to the fullest extent. On the 31st of October, Mr. Boyd and I discovered a buffalo cow and yearling calf in the ravines north of the High Divide, within 3 miles of our camp, and killed them both. The next day Private West arrived with a six mule team from Fort Keogh, in charge of Corporal Clafer and three men. This wagon brought us another 2,000 pounds of oats and various commissary stores. When it started back, on November 3, we sent by it all the skins and skeletons of buffalo, antelope, etc., which we had collected up to that date, which made a heavy load for the six mules. On this same day Mr. McNaney killed two young cow buffaloes in the bad lands south of the High Divide, which brought our total number up to fourteen. On the night of the 3d the weather turned very cold, and on the day following we experienced our first snow-storm. By that time the water in the hole, which up to that time had supplied our camp, became so thick with mud and filth that it was unendurable; and having discovered a fine pool of pure water in the bottom of a little caÃ±on on the southern slope of the High Divide we moved to it forthwith. It was really the upper spring of the main fork of the Big Porcupine, and a finer situation for a camp does not exist in that whole region. The spot which nature made for us was sheltered on all sides by the high walls of the caÃ±on, within easy reach of an inexhaustible supply of good water, and also within reach of a fair supply of dry fire-wood, which we found half a mile below. This became our last permanent camp, and its advantages made up for the barrenness and discomfort of our camp on Calf Creek. Immediately south of us, and 2 miles distant there rose a lofty conical butte about 600 feet high, which forms a very conspicuous landmark from the south. We were told that it was visible from 40 miles down the Porcupine. Strange to say, this valuable landmark was without a name, so far as we could learn; so, for our own convenience, we christened it Smithsonian Butte. The two buffalo cows that Mr. McNaney killed just before we moved our camp seemed to be the last in the country, for during the following week we scouted for 15 miles in three directions, north, east, and south, without finding as much as a hoof-print. At last we decided to go away and give that country absolute quiet for a week, in the hope that some more buffalo would come into it. Leaving McCanna and West to take care of the camp, we loaded a small assortment of general equipage into the wagon and pulled about 25 miles due west to the Musselshell River. We found a fine stream of clear water, flowing over sand and pebbles, with heavy cottonwood timber and thick copses of willow along its banks, which afforded cover for white-tailed deer. In the rugged brakes, which led from the level river bottom into a labyrinth of ravines and gullies, ridges and hog-backs, up to the level of the high plateau above, we found a scanty growth of stunted cedars and pines, which once sheltered great numbers of mule deer, elk, and bear. Now, however, few remain, and these are very hard to find. Even when found, the deer are nearly always young. Although we killed five mule deer and five white-tails, we did not kill even one fine buck, and the only one we saw on the whole trip was a long distance off. We saw fresh tracks of elk, and also grizzly bear, but our most vigorous efforts to discover the animals themselves always ended in disappointment. The many bleaching skulls and antlers of elk and deer, which we found everywhere we went, afforded proof of what that country had been as a home for wild animals only a few years ago. We were not a little surprised at finding the fleshless carcasses of three head of cattle that had been killed and eaten by bears within a few months. In addition to ten deer, we shot three wild geese, seven sharp-tailed grouse, eleven sage grouse, nine Bohemian waxwings, and a magpie, for their skeletons. We made one trip of several miles up the Musselshell, and another due west, almost to the Bull Mountains, but no signs of buffalo were found. The weather at this time was quite cold, the thermometer registering 6 degrees below zero; but, in spite of the fact that we were without shelter and had to bivouac in the open, we were, generally speaking, quite comfortable. Having found no buffalo by the 17th, we felt convinced that we ought to return to our permanent camp, and did so on that day. Having brought back nearly half a wagon-load of specimens in the flesh or half skinned, it was absolutely necessary that I should remain at camp all the next day. While I did so, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd rode over to the Buffalo Buttes, found four fine old buffalo cows, and, after a hard chase, killed them all. Under the circumstances, this was the most brilliant piece of work of the entire hunt. As the four cows dashed past the hunters at the Buffalo Buttes, heading for the High Divide, fully 20 miles distant, McNaney killed one cow, and two others went off wounded. Of course the cowboys gave chase. About 12 miles from the starting-point one of the wounded cows left her companions, was headed off by Boyd, and killed. About 6 miles beyond that one, McNaney overhauled the third cow and killed her, but the fourth one got away for a short time. While McNaney skinned the third cow and dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, Boyd took their now thoroughly exhausted horses to camp and procured fresh mounts. On returning to McNaney they set out in pursuit of the fourth cow, chased her across the High Divide, within a mile or so of our camp, and into the ravines on the northern slope, where she was killed. She met her death nearly if not quite 25 miles from the spot where the first one fell. The death of these four cows brought our number of buffaloes up to eighteen, and made us think about the possibilities of getting thirty. As we were proceeding to the Buffalo Buttes on the day after the ""kill"" to gather in the spoil, Mr. Brown and I taking charge of the wagon, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd went ahead in order to hunt. When within about 5 miles of the Buttes we came unexpectedly upon our companions, down in a hollow, busily engaged in skinning another old cow, which they had discovered traveling across the bad grounds, waylaid, and killed. We camped that night on our old ground at the Buffalo Buttes, and although we all desired to remain a day or two and hunt for more buffalo, the peculiar appearance of the sky in the northwest, and the condition of the atmosphere, warned us that a change of weather was imminent. Accordingly, the following morning we decided without hesitation that it was best to get back to camp that day, and it soon proved very fortunate for us that we so decided. Feeling that by reason of my work on the specimens I had been deprived of a fair share of the chase, I arranged for Mr. Boyd to accompany the wagon on the return trip, that I might hunt through the bad lands west of the Buffalo Buttes, which I felt must contain some buffalo. Mr. Russell went northeast and Mr. McNaney accompanied me. About 4 miles from our late camp we came suddenly upon a fine old solitary bull, feeding in a hollow between two high and precipitous ridges. After a short but sharp chase I succeeded in getting a fair shot at him, and killed him with a ball which broke his left humerus and passed into his lungs. He was the only large bull killed on the entire trip by a single shot. He proved to be a very fine specimen, measuring 5 feet 6 inches in height at the shoulders. The wagon was overtaken and called back to get the skin, and while it was coming I took a complete series of measurements and sketches of him as he lay. Although we removed the skin very quickly, and lost no time in again starting the wagon to our permanent camp, the delay occasioned by the death of our twentieth buffalo,--which occurred on November 20, precisely two months from the date of our leaving Washington to collect twenty buffalo, it possible,--caused us all to be caught in a snow-storm, which burst upon us from the northwest. The wagon had to be abandoned about 12 miles from camp in the bad lands. Mr. Brown packed the bedding on one of the horses and rode the other, he and Boyd reaching camp about 9 o'clock that night in a blinding snow-storm. Of coarse the skins in the wagon were treated with preservatives and covered up. It proved to be over a week that the wagon and its load had to remain thus abandoned before it was possible to get to it and bring it to camp, and even then the task was one of great difficulty. In this connection I can not refrain from recording the fact that the services rendered by Mr. W. Harvey Brown on all such trying occasions as the above were invaluable. He displayed the utmost zeal and intelligence, not only in the more agreeable kinds of work and sport incident to the hunt, but also in the disagreeable drudgery, such as team-driving and working on half-frozen specimens in bitter cold weather. The storm which set in on the 20th soon developed into a regular blizzard. A fierce and bitter cold wind swept down from the northwest, driving the snow before it in blinding gusts. Had our camp been poorly sheltered we would have suffered, but at it was we were fairly comfortable. Having thus completed our task (of getting twenty buffaloes), we were anxious to get out of that fearful country before we should get caught in serious difficulties with the weather, and it was arranged that Private C. S. West should ride to Fort Keogh as soon as possible, with a request for transportation. By the third day, November 23, the storm had abated sufficiently that Private West declared his willingness to start. It was a little risky, but as he was to make only 10 miles the first day and stop at the =N=-bar camp on Sand Creek, it was thought safe to let him go. He dressed himself warmly, took my revolver, in order not to be hampered with a rifle, and set out. The next day was clear and fine, and we remarked it as an assurance of Mr. West's safety during his ride from Sand Creek to the =LU=-bar ranch, his second stopping-place. The distance was about 25 miles, through bad lands all the way, and it was the only portion of the route which caused me anxiety for our courier's safety. The snow on the levels was less than 6 inches deep, the most of it having been blown into drifts and hollows; but although the coulÃ©es were all filled level to the top, our courier was a man of experience and would know how to avoid them. The 25th day of November was the most severe day of the storm, the mercury in our sheltered caÃ±on sinking to -16 degrees. We had hoped to kill at least five more buffaloes by the time Private West should arrive with the wagons; but when at the end of a week the storm had spent itself, the snow was so deep that hunting was totally impossible save in the vicinity of camp, where there was nothing to kill. We expected the wagons by the 3d of December, but they did not come that day nor within the next three. By the 6th the snow had melted off sufficiently that a buffalo hunt was once more possible, and Mr. McNaney and I decided to make a final trip to the Buffalo Buttes. The state of the ground made it impossible for us to go there and return the same day, so we took a pack-horse and arranged to camp out. When a little over half-way to our old rendezvous we came upon three buffaloes in the bad grounds, one of which was an enormous old bull, the next largest was an adult cow, and the third a two-year-old heifer. Mr. McNaney promptly knocked down the old cow, while I devoted my attention to the bull; but she presently got up and made off unnoticed at the precise moment Mr. McNaney was absorbed in watching my efforts to bring down the old bull. After a short chase my horse carried me alongside my buffalo, and as he turned toward me I gave him a shot through the shoulder, breaking the fore leg and bringing him promptly to the ground. I then turned immediately to pursue the young cow, but by that time she had got on the farther side of a deep gully which was filled with snow, and by the time I got my horse safely across she had distanced me. I then rode back to the old bull. When he saw me coming he got upon his feet and ran a short distance, but was easily overtaken. He then stood at bay, and halting within 30 yards of him I enjoyed the rare opportunity of studying a live bull buffalo of the largest size on foot on his native heath. I even made an outline sketch of him in my note-book. Having studied his form and outlines as much as was really necessary, I gave him a final shot through the lungs, which soon ended his career. This was a truly magnificent specimen in every respect. He was a ""stub-horn"" bull, about eleven years old, much larger every way than any of the others we collected. His height at the shoulder was 5 feet 8 inches perpendicular, or 2 inches more than the next largest of our collection. His hair was in remarkably fine condition, being long, fine, thick, and well colored. The hair in his frontlet is 16 inches in length, and the thick coat of shaggy, straw-colored tufts which covered his neck and shoulders measured 4 inches. His girth behind the fore leg was 8 feet 4 inches, and his weight was estimated at 1,600 pounds. [Illustration: TROPHIES OF THE HUNT. Mounted by the author in the U. S. National Museum. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] I was delighted with our remarkably good fortune in securing such a prize, for, owing to the rapidity with which the large buffaloes are being found and killed off these days, I had not hoped to capture a really old individual. Nearly every adult bull we took carried old bullets in his body, and from this one we took four of various sizes that had been fired into him on various occasions. One was found sticking fast in one of the lumbar vertebrÃ¦.[79] [Note 79: This specimen is now the commanding figure of the group of buffalo which has recently been placed on exhibition in the Museum.] After a chase of several miles Mr. McNaney finally overhauled his cow and killed her, which brought the number of buffaloes taken on the fall hunt up to twenty-two. We spent the night at the Buffalo Buttes and returned to camp the next day. Neither on that day nor the one following did the wagons arrive, and on the evening of the 8th we learned from the cowboys of the =N=-bar camp on Sand Creek that our courier, Private West, had not been seen or heard from since he left their camp on November 24, and evidently had got lost and frozen to death in the bad lands. The next day we started out to search for Private West, or news of him, and spent the night with Messrs. Brodhurst and Andrews, at their camp on Sand Creek. On the 10th, Mr. McNaney and I hunted through the bad lands over the course our courier should have taken, while Messrs. Russell and Brodhurst looked through the country around the head of the Little Dry. When McNaney and I reached the =LU=-bar ranch that night we were greatly rejoiced at finding that West was alive, although badly frost-bitten, and in Fort Keogh. It appears that instead of riding due east to the =LU=-bar ranch, he lost his way in the bad lands, where the buttes all look alike when covered with snow, and rode southwest. It is at all times an easy matter for even a cowboy to get lost in Montana if the country is new to him, and when there is snow on the ground the difficulty of finding one's way is increased tenfold. There is not only the danger of losing one's way, but the still greater danger of getting ingulfed in a deep coulÃ©e full of loose snow, which may easily cause both horse and rider to perish miserably. Even the most experienced riders sometimes ride into coulÃ©es which are level full of snow and hidden from sight. Private West's experience was a terrible one, and also a wonderful case of self-preservation. It shows what a man with a cool head and plenty of grit can go through and live. When he left us he wore two undershirts, a heavy blanket shirt, a soldier's blouse and overcoat, two pairs of drawers, a pair of soldier's woolen trousers, and a pair of overalls. On his feet he wore three pairs of socks, a pair of _low shoes_ with canvas leggins, and he started with his feet tied up in burlaps. His head and hands were also well protected. He carried a 38-caliber revolver, but, by a great oversight, only six matches. When he left the =N=-bar camp, instead of going due east toward the =LU=-bar ranch, he swung around and went southwest, clear around the head of the Little Dry, and finally struck the Porcupine south of our camp. The first night out he made a fire with sage-brush, and kept it going all night. The second night he also had a fire, but it took his last match to make it. During the first three days he had no food, but on the fourth he shot a sage-cock with his revolver, and ate it raw. This effort, however, cost him his last cartridge. Through hard work and lack of food his pony presently gave out, and necessitated long and frequent stops for rest. West's feet threatened to freeze, and he cut off the skirts of his overcoat to wrap them with, in place of the gunny sacking, that had been worn to rags. Being afraid to go to sleep at night, he slept by snatches in the warmest part of the day, while resting his horse. On the 5th day he began to despair of succor, although he still toiled southward through the bad lands toward the Yellowstone, where people lived. On the envelopes which contained my letters he kept a diary of his wanderings, which could tell his story when the cowboys would find his body on the spring round-up. On the afternoon of the sixth day he found a trail and followed it until nearly night, when he came to Cree's sheep ranch, and found the solitary ranchman at home. The warm-hearted frontiersman gave the starving wanderers, man and horse, such a welcome as they stood in need of. West solemnly declares that in twenty-four hours he ate a whole sheep. After two or three days of rest and feeding both horse and rider were able to go on, and in course of time reached Fort Keogh. Without the loss of a single day Colonel Gibson started three teams and an escort up to us, and notwithstanding his terrible experience, West had the pluck to accompany them as guide. His arrival among us once more was like the dead coming to life again. The train reached our camp on the 13th, and on the 15th we pulled out for Miles City, loaded to the wagon-bows with specimens, forage, and camp plunder. From our camp down to the =HV= ranch, at the mouth of Sand Creek, the trail was in a terrible condition. But, thanks to the skill and judgment of the train-master, Mr. Ed. Haskins, and his two drivers, who also knew their business well, we got safely and in good time over the dangerous part of our road. Whenever our own tired and overloaded team got stuck in the mud, or gave out, there was always a pair of mules ready to hitch on and help us out. As a train-master, Mr. Haskins was a perfect model, skillful, pushing, good-tempered, and very obliging. From the =HV= ranch to Miles City the trail was in fine condition, and we went in as rapidly as possible, fearing to be caught in the snow-storm which threatened us all the way in. We reached Miles City on December 20, with our collection complete and in fine condition, and the next day a snow-storm set in which lasted until the 25th, and resulted in over a foot of snow. The ice running in the Yellowstone stopped all the ferry-boats, and it was with good reason that we congratulated ourselves on the successful termination of our hunt at that particular time. Without loss of time Mr. Brown and I packed our collection, which tilled twenty-one large cases, turned in our equipage at Fort Keogh, sold our horses, and started on our homeward journey. In due course of time the collection reached the Museum in good condition, and a series of the best specimens it contains has already been mounted. At this point it is proper to acknowledge our great indebtedness to the Secretary of War for the timely co-operation of the War Department, which rendered the expedition possible. Our thanks are due to the officers who were successively in command at Fort Keogh during our work, Col. John D. Wilkins, Col. George M. Gibson, and Lieut. Col. M. A. Cochran, and their various staff officers; particularly Lieut. C. B. Thompson, quartermaster, and Lieut. H. K. Bailey, adjutant. It is due these officers to state that everything we asked for was cheerfully granted with a degree of promptness which contributed very greatly to the success of the hunt, and lightened its labors very materially. I have already acknowledged our indebtedness to the officers of the Pennsylvania; the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; and Northern Pacific railways for the courtesies so liberally extended in our emergency. I take pleasure in adding that all the officers and employÃ©s of the Northern Pacific Railway with whom we had any relations, particularly Mr. C. S. Fee, general passenger and ticket agent, treated our party with the utmost kindness and liberality throughout the trip. We are in like manner indebted to the officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway for valuable privileges granted with the utmost cordiality. Our thanks are also due to Dr. J. C. Merrill, and to Mr. Henry R. Phillips, of the Phillips Land and Cattle Company, on Little Dry Creek, for valuable information at a critical moment, and to the latter for hospitality and assistance in various ways, at times when both were keenly appreciated. Counting the specimens taken in the spring, our total catch of buffalo amounted to twenty-five head, and constituted as complete and fine a series as could be wished for. I am inclined to believe that in size and general quality of pelage the adult bull and cow selected and mounted for our Museum group are not to be surpassed, even if they are ever equaled, by others of their kind. The different ages and sexes were thus represented in our collection: 10 old bulls, 1 young bull, 7 old cows, 4 young cows, 2 yearling calves, 1 three-months calf[80]; total, 25 specimens. [Note 80: Caught alive, but died in captivity July 26, 1886, and now in the mounted group.] Our total collection of specimens of _Bison americanus_, including everything taken, contained the following: 24 fresh skins, 1 head skin, 8 fresh skeletons, 8 dry skeletons, 51 dry skulls, 2 foetal young; total, 94 specimens. Our collection as a whole also included a fine series of skins and skeletons of antelope, deer of two species, coyotes, jack rabbits, sage grouse (of which we prepared twenty-four rough skeletons for the Department of Comparative Anatomy), sharp tailed grouse, and specimens of all the other species of birds and small mammals to be found in that region at that season. From this _matÃ©riel_ we now have on exhibition besides the group of buffaloes, a family group of antelope, another of coyotes, and another of prairie dogs, all with natural surroundings. III. THE MOUNTED GROUP IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. The result of the Smithsonian expedition for bison which appeals most strongly to the general public is the huge group of six choice specimens of both sexes and all ages, mounted with natural surroundings, and displayed in a superb mahogany case. The dimensions of the group are as follows: Length, 16 feet; width, 12 feet, and height, 10 feet. The subjoined illustration is a very fair representation of the principal one of its four sides, and the following admirable description (by Mr. Harry P. Godwin), from the Washington _Star_ of March 10, 1888, is both graphic and accurate: A SCENE FROM MONTANA--SIX OF MR. HORNADAY'S BUFFALOES FORM A PICTURESQUE GROUP--A BIT OF THE WILD WEST REPRODUCED AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM--SOMETHING NOVEL IN THE WAY OF TAXIDERMY--REAL BUFFALO-GRASS, REAL MONTANA DIRT, AND REAL BUFFALOES. A little bit of Montana--a small square patch from the wildest part of the wild West--has been transferred to the National Museum. It is so little that Montana will never miss it, but enough to enable one who has the faintest glimmer of imagination to see it all for himself--the hummocky prairie, the buffalo-grass, the sage-brush, and the buffalo. It is as though a little group of buffalo that have come to drink at a pool had been suddenly struck motionless by some magic spell, each in a natural attitude, and then the section of prairie, pool, buffalo, and all had been carefully cut out and brought to the National Museum. All this is in a huge glass case, the largest ever made for the Museum. This case and the space about it, at the south end of the south hall, has been inclosed by high screens for many days while the taxidermist and his assistants have been at work. The finishing touches were put on to-day, and the screens will be removed Monday, exposing to view what is regarded as a triumph of the taxidermist's art. The group, with its accessories, has been prepared so as to tell in an attractive way to the general visitor to the Museum the story of the buffalo, but care has been taken at the same time to secure an accuracy of detail that will satisfy the critical scrutiny of the most technical naturalist. THE ACCESSORIES. The pool of water is a typical alkaline water-hole, such as are found on the great northern range of bison, and are resorted to for water by wild animals in the fall when the small streams are dry. The pool is in a depression in the dry bed of a coulÃ©e or small creek. A little mound that rises beside the creek has been partially washed away by the water, leaving a crumbling bank, which shows the strata of the earth, a very thin layer of vegetable soil, beneath a stratum of grayish earth, and a layer of gravel, from which protrude a fossil bone or two. The whole bank shows the marks of erosion by water. Near by the pool a small section of the bank has fallen. A buffalo trail passes by the pool in front. This is a narrow path, well beaten down, depressed, and bare of grass. Such paths were made by herds of bison all over their pasture region as they traveled down water-courses, in single file, searching for water. In the grass some distance from the pool lie the bleaching skulls of two buffalo who have fallen victims to hunters who have cruelly lain in wait to get a shot at the animals as they come to drink. Such relics, strewn all over the plain, tell the story of the extermination of the American bison. About the pool and the sloping mound grow the low buffalo-grass, tufts of tall bunch-grass and sage-brush, and a species of prickly pear. The pool is clear and tranquil. About its edges is a white deposit of alkali. These are the scenic accessories of the buffalo group, but they have an interest almost equal to that of the buffaloes themselves, for they form really and literally a genuine bit of the West. The homesick Montana cowboy, far from his wild haunts, can here gaze upon his native sod again; for the sod, the earth that forms the face of the bank, the sage-brush, and all were brought from Montana--all except the pool. The pool is a glassy delusion, and very perfect in its way. One sees a plant growing beneath the water, and in the soft, oozy bottom, near the edge, are the deep prints made by the fore feet of a big buffalo bull. About the soft, moist earth around the pool, and in the buffalo trail are the foot-tracks of the buffalo that have tramped around the pool, some of those nearest the edge having filled with water. THE SIX BUFFALOES. The group comprises six buffaloes. In front of the pool, as if just going to drink, is the huge buffalo bull, the giant of his race, the last one that was secured by the Smithsonian party in 1888, and the one that is believed to be the largest specimen of which there is authentic record. Near by is a cow eight years old, a creature that would be considered of great dimensions in any other company than that of the big bull. Near the cow is a suckling calf, four months old. Upon the top of the mound is a ""spike"" bull, two and a half years old; descending the mound away from the pool is a young cow three years old, on one side, and on the other a male calf a year and a half old. All the members of the group are disposed in natural attitudes. The young cow is snuffing at a bunch of tall grass; the old bull and cow are turning their heads in the same direction apparently, as if alarmed by something approaching; the others, having slaked their thirst, appear to be moving contentedly away. The four months' old calf was captured alive and brought to this city. It lived for some days in the Smithsonian grounds, but pined for its prairie home, and finally died. It is around the great bull that the romance and main interest of the group centers. * * * * * It seemed as if Providence had ordained that this splendid animal, perfect in limb, noble in size, should be saved to serve as a monument to the greatness of his race, that once roamed the prairies in myriads. Bullets found in his body showed that he had been chased and hunted before, but fate preserved him for the immortality of a Museum exhibit. His vertical height at the shoulders is 5 feet 8 inches. The thick hair adds enough to his height to make it full 6 feet. The length of his head and body is 9 feet 2 inches, his girth 8 feet 4 inches and his weight is, or was, about 1,600 pounds. THE TAXIDERMIST'S OBJECT LESSONS. This group, with its accessories, is, in point of size, about the biggest thing ever attempted by a taxidermist. It was mounted by Mr. Hornaday, assisted by Messrs. J. Palmer and A. H. Forney. It represents a new departure in mounting specimens for museums. Generally such specimens have been mounted singly, upon a flat surface. The American mammals, collected by Mr. Hornaday, will be mounted in a manner that will make each piece or group an object lesson, telling something of the history and the habits of the animal. The first group produced as one of the results of the Montana hunt comprised three coyotes. Two of them are struggling, and one might almost say snarling, over a bone. They do not stand on a painted board, but on a little patch of soil. Two other groups designed by Mr. Hornaday, and executed by Mr. William Palmer, are about to be placed in the Museum. One of these represents a family of prairie-dogs. They are disposed about a prairie-dog mound. One sits on its haunches eating; others are running about. Across the mouth of the burrow, just ready to disappear into it, is another one, startled for the moment by the sudden appearance of a little burrowing owl that has alighted on one side of the burrow. The owl and the dog are good friends and live together in the same burrow, but there appears to be strained relations between the two for the moment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢ Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundationâs website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
